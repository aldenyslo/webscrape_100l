		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) is a multi-site longitudinal, epidemiologic study designed to examine the health of women during their middle years. The study examines the physical, biological, psychological, and social changes during this transitional period. The goal of SWAN's research is to help scientists, health care providers and women learn how mid-life experiences affect health and quality of life during aging. The data include questions about doctor visits, medical conditions, medications, treatments, medical procedures, relationships, smoking, and menopause related information such as age at pre-, peri- and post-menopause, self-attitudes, feelings, and common physical problems associated with menopause. </p>
<p>The study is co-sponsored by the National Institute on Aging (NIA), the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health. The study began in 1994. Between 2000 and 2002, 2,679 of the 3,302 women that joined SWAN were seen for their second follow-up visit. The research centers are located in the following communities: Boston, Massachusetts, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Oakland and Los Angeles, California, Detroit, Michigan, Newark, New Jersey and Chicago, Illinois. SWAN participants represent five racial/ethnic groups and a variety of backgrounds and cultures.</p></span></p>

								<p><span><strong>Version History:</strong> 2019-05-15 This data collection has been enhanced in the following ways. The title of the study was updated to match current ICPSR standards. Variable labels have been revised to spell out abbreviations and acronyms, and to correct prior misspellings. The variables in the dataset have also been reordered to match the documentation provided by the Principal Investigator. A fuller version of the question text pertaining to individual variables was completed, and now available in the ICPSR codebook. An additional document was included in this release that lists all the publications based off of the SWAN data series. Lastly, the study is now available for online analysis., 2018-09-24 The data collection was updated with revised missing values provided by the P.I., 2018-02-15 The citation of this study may have changed due to the new version control system that has been implemented.
