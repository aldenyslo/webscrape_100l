EVERYDAY! brain scans clear. blood tests all normal except hormones that have plummeted into menopause levels despite still getting the occasional period.

It came on suddenly which of course triggered my anxiety. I was on my way to pick up my kids from school when it hit me. Menopause doesn't play fair. Thankfully I was able to get home but I was miserable. It seems to get aggregated when I've not eaten in a while and is somewhat relieved when I eat. I took a prilosec and an Alleve for the pain which helped a lot. Have any of you experienced this?"

I never used to be like this, I look at other people and wonder what it feels like to get up each morning and just live your life without worry. I have seen my gp but they just offer anti depressants which I dont want to take. Does anyone else feel like this?

I spent most of the weekend on the couch being lazy (my poor daughter was so bored) but I just needed to rest! I try not to nap, thinking that will help me sleep through the night. I try to stay up a bit later, thinking that will help. Nothing helps! I just wake up around 3:30 and that's it. My mind starts going a mile a minute, even when I try to do my relaxation/meditation exercises. I also get these weird muscle spasms during this time that make it even harder to settle down. I'm not sure if this is due to the fact that I've recently started on a low dose of Lexapro (my doc said it could cause sleep disturbances) or my regular perimenopause insomnia or a combination. I just want a full night's sleep! Sorry - just had to vent. 😦"

Yesterday it was a bad head that moved to my stomach and yes , I do suffer from migraines , but today I have like an ibs type if pain and just feel more like its a bug . I would rather it was, just so that I feel better in a few days . Its certainly not easy going through all this and I dont want to keep confiding in my husband and daughter , as I just think they must be so fed up of listening to all my ailments . Heres hoping that I gradually feel better over the next few days . FYI , I did finish a heavy period last week after being three months late , so maybe my immune system is low .

Been better) **NOW, I have this weird sensation in the back of my throat and ever once in awhile I will have shooting jaw and ear pain.

I have looked in my throat and there is nothing out of the ordinary that I can see . Sick of all these tests (all blood tests, CA-125, the poop sample test (not to be gross) has came back normal.

DH59,2018-11-30T15:34+00:00,When does this nightmare end?,"I am beginning to scare myself by Googling symptoms, but I am worried about some vision problems I am currently having. Since starting the menopause 12 years ago I have had ocular migraines (where a line of flashing lights move across the eye), but they were many months apart. I read that they can be hormonal and/or caused by similar triggers to normal migraines. I can now get up to four a week, but recently I have also had another type of eye problem, with flashing lines in the left eye peripheral vision, and then I had a funny dizzy spell where I felt everything go blurred for a few seconds and my head felt really strange. I had one of these episodes about 18 months ago and thought it was a one-off, but this second one now has me quite worried. I saw an ophthalmologist about the flashes, who said there was no detached retina, but recommended I see a neurologist. I saw one last week and he referred me for a CT scan but that was then cancelled as the machine broke! My sister has had similar ocular migraines over the years, and also had these dizzy spells, then she had a stroke last year, so now I am really concerned. I am currently taking beta blockers (for palpitations/irregular heartbeats) and vision problems are one of the side effects listed, so now I am not sure whether it is the tablets, menopause, or whether I am about to have a stroke! Can anyone relate to these symptoms?"
bev27429,2018-12-02T16:26+00:00,So Tired With This Process. I Need Some Positive Words.,"I have been going through the emotional challenges of perimenopause for close to 16 months now. I get to a point where I think that I am better, and I even tell people that I think it is finally over, only to have it come back and crash down all around me, once again. I have such weird thinking and feel so hopeless sometimes. My symptoms are all over the place now. I have been spending this weekend with my boyfriend, and I find myself getting filled with anger just listening to him eat his breakfast; it's so weird. I love him deeply; he is an absolute gem, but I start thinking that I just want to be by myself. Then, the next minute, I am filled with love for him and feel peaceful and totally content. I know that it is hormones, and I keep reminding myself of this, but it is just so awful to have thoughts and feelings and impulses that I know are not me. Sometimes, I just don't know how to keep going through all of these emotions which switch from anxiety, to dark depression, to irritation, to rage, to frustration, to hopelessness, to peace, to happiness, to appreciation for my life (in no particular order). This is, by far, the most bizarre thing that I have ever had to endure. I just keep telling myself to keep going and that, one day, it will be over. Any positive thoughts for me?"

In addition to the tingling in my foot that I had a few weeks ago (that has gone away), I'm now experiencing random tingling (feels like it's just under my skin) up and down my right leg, mostly in the thigh. Well, something new happened and of course, I went to good old Dr. Google, and now I'm totally convinced I have MS. Yesterday at work, it totally felt like I had sat in something wet, so much so that I reached down to feel my left upper thigh/butt. Completely dry. That seems to be one of the less common symptoms of MS. Yikes! I am trying not to get super-freaked out, but it's so so hard. I will be seeing my PCP in a few weeks to check in on my new meds (for high blood pressure and anxiety) and will bring it up then. Ughhh....."

rhonda86833,2018-11-28T23:36+00:00,The Joys of Dealing with Medical Doctors,"For the past 2 years I have had a small, movable knot in my left armpit. It is always a little sore if I press on it, but during my period it is painful just to move my arm. Not horrible, but there is tenderness there. I have seen a surgeon twice and my gynecologist twice. I have had 2 ultrasounds and 2 mammograms over the past 2 years. The results have been that it is a swollen lymph node with no explanation about the reason it is swollen beyond, ""It's hormones."" I went to my general practitioner last week and told him that the lump/knot was still there and that I have a burning sensation on the inside of my arm from my armpit to my elbow and also a burning pain on my left shoulder blade. He decided to send me to a neurologist since he thinks it's nerve related. The neurologist feels of the knot and says, ""That's not a lymph node. That's a tendon. That's the bicep brachii tendon."" So... is it a tendon? Is it a lymph node?? Oh the humanity!!!"

Guest,2018-11-28T16:42+00:00,For the dizzy ladies with migraine brains...,"Hello my fellow She-rah warriors! I had an appointment at an eye and ear hospital with an otoneurologist. I have suffered migraines since the onset of peri. Anywhere from 3 to my record of 9 this past month. But, worse is my constant off balanced, swaying feeling. Over sensitive to smells, sounds, visual, weather...you name it! The dr was excellent. He listened to all my weird feelings and validated that they are real. He thinks I do indeed have vestibular migraines. Did the regular neuro testing, which was ok. I had an MRI last year and he did not see the need to do another. I have to go for proper balance testing in January. It is very common when the hormones are fluctuating in peri to trigger migraines. Sometimes post meno is a trigger too. But, some of us are more sensitive...along with other triggers. Cycle, Stress, anxiety, weather, food or whatever else sets off our migraines. The dizziness or off balanced, hypersensitive feelings are our brain trying to figure out all the mixed signals. I suffer awful from fatigue too. Chronic Migraines can cause fatigue too. He explained it like having chronic pain that never switches off. The brain is working overtime to compensate. I get terrible neck pain too, which is a migraine thing too. I believe I started peri at 38. I was getting flashes periodically. Also, tension type headaches more often and around my cycle. Did acupuncture for 2 years...no relief. Massages made them worse. He said that tension headaches can be a pre curser to migraine. In the meantime, he changed my med to norotripyline. Told me to try magnesium and B2. until I get the balance testing done...which will rule out inner ear damage...I get tinnitus in both ears...by a virus, etc. I asked about if HRT would help, he said some women do find relief that way...some do not. But, mentioned that if women are worried about risks for HRT...other meds to help that do not carry that risk...but of course hormones...not his expertise! If you ladies have already seen an ENT and have been blown off. Please look into an otoneuro. if you have an eye and eye hospital within reach. Ear, nose, throat doc that deals with the vestibular system and the brain. It is not your imagination that you are stumbling around. Stay well, my friends!"

lorraine21138,2018-11-26T09:58+00:00,Worried about mental symptoms,"Hi ladies - don't really know why I'm posting - just going through a bad patch I guess. I had a really bad day recently where my brain just stopped working - that's the only way I can describe it. Out Christmas shopping and I just couldn't recall my niece's names. Its ridiculous - we are a close family, but for the life of me I couldn't recall their names and I went into a right panic. My memory lapses are awful at time and I'm worrying I've got dementia or a tumour or something. I keep getting very light headed too - especially when I'm working at my computer however I have had a cold recently so assume its related to that. Going through a rough time, my dad is dying of cancer, my husband is having heart problems and Christmas is around the corner and stress levels are very high. I really don't want to go on anti-depressants, I'm taking Kalms. I know this all sounds like I'm really depressed but I think I'm coping - I guess I would just feel better reading that this brain stuff is quite common....and that I'm not going mad....can anyone relate to the awful memory issues? When I'm in a conversation it can be really embarrassing - saying the wrong word a few times and not being able to explain things. Not all the time and definitely worse when I'm tired.

Every symptom seem to disappeared except for the bloating and constipation. I was waking up with the doom feeling and anxiety every morning ...and though it's only been a week but still it's progress for me considering all the symptoms I had. My abdomen is so bloated especially the right side. In one area close to the liver/ gallbladder area and near the belly button ( intestine area) I can actually see it humpty in that area. Even if I lean toward the right or lie on the right side the hump is even more visible or it seem to lean toward right. I went to my GI Dr this week and she did noticed it and is sending me for a ultrasound on Monday which has me very very nervous. She 's checking my pelvic too. My period came down last night which makes it even more bloated, and it's heavier than usual. By the way, I only have one ovary and yes it is on the right side."

Klp77,2018-11-20T10:38+00:00,I'm destroying my marriage!,"So, last year I almost wrecked my marriage to my lovely, kind, thoughtful husband by being absolutely and uncontrollably vile to him as my peri symptoms got worse and worse. Thankfully he was really supportive and stuck by me. I was put on HRT back in October last year (and had the level increased in March this year) which really seemed to help, but just recently it has started again. I am just filled with such a sense of self-loathing and lack of control over my own mind and body that I am behaving totally irrationally towards him - to the point I have made him cry twice in the past few weeks (and he's not someone who cries easily). I hate the fact I am putting on weight despite eating very little. I hate the fact I can't exercise because of having a major and prolonged relapse of my ME. I hate the fact I am turning into a hairy beast - literally!!!!! I hate the fact I am too tired to do any of the fun stuff in life. I hate the fact I get anxious about EVERYTHING - even the stupid stuff. I hate the fact I can't eat anything except the most bland boring food because anything else upsets my stomach. I hate the fact that I am unable to keep a friendship and seem to drive everyone away, even my own sister. I hate the fact that every single day seems difficult. And I hate the fact I'm letting all this impact so much on my life and that of my poor husband when I know that there are so many people out there who are worse off than me. I don't want to destroy my marriage ... but have no idea what to do."

amy341731,2018-11-20T01:40+00:00,High blood pressure,"Hi all- well I have been on here for various other perimenopausal symptoms.… But now I have a new one that may or may not be related to perimenopause. Since last year my blood pressure has suddenly gone up to about 150/95, when it was normally 125/75 or so. I have gained about 20 pounds in the last two years or so and had the stress of grad school and currently a new job as a teacher, but I actually enjoy it and didn’t think it was very stressful. I’m just wondering if this is yet another perimenopause symptom or just an old age thing/getting fat thing.☹ Also, if you have experienced a rise in blood pressure, have you had to take medication or have you been able to control it with lifestyle changes? I really do not want to take any medication. I have been taking Sudafed and Advil as well as omeprazole this past year with a sudden crappy rise in perimenopause symptoms, like stuffy nose, allergies, heartburn and achy joints at the time... those symptoms are terrible, but I even discontinued all those last week once I found out I had a high blood pressure, to see if that helps. It’s been five days and it’s no better without those meds. I do have a doctor appointment tomorrow but I was just wondering what anyone’s thoughts here were. I appreciate any and all feedback. Take care and have a wonderful Thanksgiving!"

It is ALMOST 1 year since my last period. Though I was skating through this and hope this is all it is as with every ache/pain I am seriously convinced I have cancer and the anxiety of thinking that is debilitating on it's own. Does ANY of this sound familiar: Bouts of nausea lasting for days on end. It seems to come and go and when they hit - OH BOY! I lost about 5 lbs every-time as I have no appetite at all. Never really threw up but certainly wanted to. All blood test came back perfect including my CA-125 which was a 6 (I think that is good - anybody have an opinion on this test please chime in as I have heard it is not very reliable). She did confirm I am post menopause according to my FSH and other test she did. My BIGGEST issue that has me ""at the moment"" as different crap pops up all the time is my right shoulder blade. I have had this burning ache under my right scapula which comes and goes for about 2 years. As we all do Google searches when I look links this to lung, breast or esophageal cancer which is putting me in panic mode! I am right handed and my posture (admittedly sucks). I work from home and sit with my legs to the side crouched over my computer for about 10 hours a day. Stress has been at an all time high. We just had 14 immediate family member lose EVERYTHING in the Camp Fire (Paradise CA) so my house has been full of screaming little ones trying to bring them just a slice of normal while they rebuild their life. I don't think that is it as this seem to come and go every few months. My husband will rub on the knot (it hurts when he digs and massages it and feels like a muscle knot). I am praying it's just a pulled muscle from my neck leaning forward but still bothersome! Anybody else?"

evelyne00,2017-11-05T22:51+00:00,So worried! Can this be perimenopause?,"Hi ladies, First of all: English isn't my native language so please excuse me if I make any  mistakes. But I can't find enough info in my native language, so that's why I try this forum. I'm 42 and I've had very regular periods until now. They always started at the right time and always followed the same pattern: starting with light bleeding the first day, followed by (very) heavy bleeding with blood clots and cramps the second day, stabilizing to a normal period without pain the 3th day. The whole thing always lasted about a week. Maybe the heavy bleeding with blood clots got worse the last 2 years but I can't compare cause I've been taken the contraceptive pill for years so I don't really remember how a natural period of mine went before that. I've stop taking the pill because my husband has had a vascetomy by the way.  Anyway, my last period was different. It took longer until it broke through, the bleeding wasn't as heavy as usual and it also ended earlier. Three days after the end of that pretty unusual period, I had sexual intercourse with my hubby. One day after that, I noticed some watery, pinkish discharge. At the second day, it got less watery but the pink discharge lasted for 8 days and sometimes there were very little pieces of dried blood in it. But it was never enough to use a tampon or a pad, it was only noticeable on the toiletpaper.  Then, 8 days after I've had intercourse and 10 days after the end of that unusual period, the discharge stopped. But I still felt some abdominal bloating. And that same night, I scared myself to death! Suddenly there was a bleeding again with bright red blood! The morning after, the red blood was gone and some very, very light pinkish discharge was back.  I've made an appointement with the doctor but that is only for the end of this week and in the mean time, I'm worried sick! :-(  All my female friends say that I'm too young for the perimenopause. Only my husand says it might be that. Cause I've had sleeping problems for a while. Being tired but not being able to sleep. And a few months ago, I've had this skipping heartbeat from time to time.. Sometimes that was also the reason why I couldn't sleep. That was very scary so I went to see the dr but he couldn't find anything abnormal. I also have worse PMS than I've had before, but I thought it was because my periods are natural now and not ruled by contraception anymore. I also experience hair loss. But I thought that was because of the chemical dying of my hair. So I stopped doing that recently but even when it's that, it will take a while before my hair is healthy again. So I don't know whether this hair loss comes from the dying or is hormonal.  Is there anyone here who reconses this? Can the perimenopause start like this? Or can those symptoms I described - the skipping heartbeat, the hair loss, not being able to sleep - be symptoms and are these period troubles the next step? When I Google it, the most scary things appear so I'm really, really very scared. :-("

So if cancer of the uterus is the main concern, then why not hysterectomy???"

I had both ovaries removed 2012 due to severe PMT. Since then I've tried bioIdentical HRT and Utrogestan, tablets and patches. None of these have helped relieve severe menopause symptoms. I'm now taking Duavive, prescribed by NHS Sexual Health Consultant. Trying this as a last resort before considering a hysterectomy. The first week I felt amazing, more energy, positive mood and no sore joints. It's gone dramaticaly down hill in the last 3 weeks, severe low mood, lethargy, insomnia, digestive problems and memory loss. I've decided to stop taking it as I can't cope feeling like this. Sorry for the long post but I'm desperate for any advice or experiences with Duavive. Thank you in advance for reading my post."

tebrown96,2018-11-13T16:44+00:00,Perimenopause symptoms are making me feel crazy,"Hi all, just joined these boards. Please bare with me if this is long and rambly. I am 44 years old and think I have been in perimenopause since early this year. I always had a clockwork cycle of 28 days and then at the beginning of this year, my cycles dropped to almost exactly 21 days with pretty light flow. In the spring, I dealt with heart palpitations that lasted a few weeks (everthing w/heart checked out okay). Then this summer, they started getting longer, out to about 30/32 days. In August, I had crushing tenderness in my right breast, so much that while my GYN didn't think it was anything more than hormonal changes, I went for an U/S just to be sure (came back clear). Around the same time, I started having terrible insomnia and night sweats (no daytime hot flashes though) and saw my PCP. She sent me for some bloodwork and my FSH came back at 57, so she confirmed my suspicion of perimenopause. I didn't get a period at all in September but it did come back late October into the first week of November, at which point I had a few more heart palpitations over a few days. I've also been dealing with some really bad muscle tension in my upper back, to the point where I thought it pinched a nerve when I had some 'dead arm' feeling in my left arm, which I saw my PCP about a couple of weeks ago. She has me going to PT, which is helping a ton, and the PT diagnosed it as Upper Crossed Syndrome. On top of that, starting about a week ago, almost every day at about the same time my feet tingle (almost always starts ~10/10:30 AM and is on and off for a few hours) more in my right foot than my left. It goes away and then no more tingling until the next day around the same time. I've read that tingling in the extremities can be another perimenopause symptom, but my goodness, it's by far my most disconcerting one. It's ratcheting up my anxiety and I almost have myself convinced that I have MS. I asked my physical therapist today if there could be any connection to the stretches and exercises I'm doing for my neck/back/chest and she said no. I made an appoinment to see my PCP this afternoon, even though I fear she's going to think I'm a nutcase/hypochondriac. These symptoms are driving me mad and I hate feeling this way. I hate the anxiety it causes me, I hate that I jump to worse-case scenarios, I hate feeling like my body is falling apart. Has anyone else experienced this? Any words of advice? Things I can do to try to calm myself down? Thank you in advance!"

karen156794231,2018-10-28T17:35+00:00,Looking for hope,"Hello to all - I have been perimenopausal for several years, but did not experience debilitating symptoms until the last four months. My life has completely changed. Within these last few months, I have been to the ENT (normal), the neurologist (brain MRI normal), the caridiologist (heart good), my primary care, and two OB/GYNs, together with physical therapy and acupuncture. (I know many of you have a similar experience.) My primary symptoms are extreme dizziness and nausea, with brain zaps and head tingling. I took time away from work, but had to go back once my disability ran out. It seems the consensus is that my symptoms are a result of hormone induced anxiety. I am told I am not a candidate for HRT (the OB/GYN said she has not heard of these symptoms from her patients and she is a menopause specialist!), and the ""only"" medication is to go on an SSRI. I lasted 9 days on one before because I got so sick. Is there any hope? Do any of you know women who experienced severe, chronic symptoms and eventually made it through without any medications? Wishing you all well. Take care."

Guest,2018-11-10T16:33+00:00,So tired...so very very tired of this,"I am 52 and have been going through this hormonal hell for the past 4 years. I am going through a really rough spot - physically with a myriad of symptoms and emotinally questioning a lot about my life, myself, my marriage and the future. I am struggling with trying to determine if the new found depression I am feeling is hormonal thereby causing me to question a lot of what is going on in my life and, if I am honest, disliking a lot of where I am at in my life specifically with my marriage. I feel like as the weeks pass and turn into months that I am slowly removing myself from my relationship. Why do things I would have glossed years ago over now infuriate me? Is it the hormones? I just don't know. I have such internal rage at times and yet I push it aside for fear if I express it then my husband will view me as unbalanced or just plain insane. He is aware that I am struggling. He is sympathetic (to a degree) but all in all I know he just wants things to be 'normal'. Today is especially bad...I am in a 'pit' so to speak. I understand now when people who suffer from depression say it's like moving through quick sand. That is how I am feeling at this moment. And then there are days when all is okay. I say to myself ""See, let it pass and things will be back to normal.""...but it never stays that way. I didn't wake up feeling this way. I woke with the usual aches and pains but mentally was okay other than the nagging dread (of who knows what??) that is always in the back of my mind. However, within a couple of hours, this black cloud just washed over me. Just like that. Does anyone else ever have shifts in their mood like this? It is so disconcerting. I am very thankful for this forum as I know many of you are...it is a safe place to vent with women who truly understand the struggle of menopause."

ameliajane71,2017-03-18T13:56+00:00,Most Severe Perimenopause Ever? Plus Sagging Skin - Desperate,"This is my first post.  I am not exaggerating about anything I am sharing here. All is completely real and serious, and I am so very desperate for help and direction.  I thank each and every one of you willing to read and reach out . . .  My nightmare started just over one year ago when I turned 44.  It was my birthday, and I woke up to what I now realize was a hot flash.  I am a college instructor, and I went to work.  During classes, the hot flashes came one after the other, intensely, as well as severe anxiety and panic.  Within hours, I noticed severe heartburn, nausea, ringing in my ears, and a significant feeling of genital arousal.  The nausea intensified, and I ended up heaving in the bathroom.  I noticed my skin seemed very deyhdrated, so I drank extra water, and then, I called my husband at work in tears, telling him I did not know what was wrong with me.  I somehow suffered through my afternoon classes and scheduled an appointment with my OBGYN.  My family doctor had recently retired.  Upon getting home from work, I experienced tremendous fatigue.  I was unable to even prepare a meal for myself.  I wondered if I had a viral infection.  The exhaustion was indescribable.  Later, it would become clear that my adrenals were crashing each day after surging cortisol until they could not any longer. Complicating matters was the fact that I had just gotten out of a false ""friendship"" with a man who contacted me through a health network for a rare neurological disorder from which I had recovered years before.  I wanted to help and be a support as this condition is quite isoloating.  It turned out that this person was some sort of sexual predator with psychopathic traits and zero conscience.   I was emotionally abused at a distance (since I never met this person) over a period of nearly a year.  He was an intelligent professional in a respectable position, and I was fooled by his mask.  Over months, he systematically manipulated my emotions, though I excused much because of his ""illness"".  He began to subtlely berate me, my appearance (though most people compliment me), and things that are meaningful in my life.  His behavior became more perverse and cruel, and eventually, the mask came off.  I was so unbelievably traumatized by this whole situation, as I had attached to his fake persona.  Then, the cyberstalking and hang-up calls began, and they have continued over the past 18 months.  We have disconnected our phone, email, and changed cell numbers.  Anyway, I became ill with symptoms about six months after I stopped contact with him.  The damage to my self esteem and sense of worth and value would prove to be very difficult to recover.  I sought professional therapy and found great help there. My symptoms became so severe, I began making plans to take medical leave at work, after 11 years of barely using a sick day.  My symptoms were intense and continuous 24/7: Hot flashes, night sweats, persistent genital arousal (which often progressed to a type of nerve pain down there), heartburn, nausea/heaving, thinning hair, dryness everywhere, ringing in my ears, sound sensitivity, pins and needles sensations, EXTREME fatigue every day, body temp;erature fluctuations - hot and cold, insomnia, panic attacks, anxiety, and OCD symptoms, as well as body dysmorphic disorder, suicidal thoughts, depression, and loss of appetite/weight loss, and loss of muscle mass.  I noticed that my symptoms worsened on changing body positions.  For example, rolling over in bed in the morning could cause my heart to begin racing.  Also, going from sitting to standing coiuld do the same. I have a history of mild, generalized anxiety, (never took meds for it) but these new symptoms were far, far beyond anything I had ever experienced before.  The symptoms were either on or off.  When on, ALL of them were happening at the same time and to a high intensity.  Otherwise, they were off, but there were very, very few periods of this during the first four to six months.   I was beyond miserable.  I wondered if I had cancer (due to fatigue) or perhaps some other disease.  Surely, this could not all be due to hormones shifting. My OBGYN performed blood tests, and my estrogen came back at 90-something, which she said was fine; that I was not menopausal.  She said my issues did not seem to be menopause related; that I should see an encocrinologist. I scheduled with an endocrinologist who tested my cortisol levels, which came back elevated throughout the day but not high enough to be Cushings disease.  He said my symptoms did not seem to be endocrine related and that I should see an OBGYN. I visited functional medicine specialists who said I should be taking bio-identical progesterone only.  I was skeptical, as I had already been taking a progestin for years due to endomentriosis pain, and of course, never had a problem with it, but now felt terrible.  No one mentioned estrogen.  They claimed I was ""estrogen dominant"" even though I was experiencing severe hot flashes, hair loss, dry, thin, sagging skin, and all the rest.  I was scared to try the progesterone cream and go off the med I had used successfully for endo for many years. I contacted a sexual health specialist about the persistent genital arousal disorder, which is very rare, and he said he believed the cause of mine to be ""central"", meaning originating in the central nervous system.  He said there is no cure, only management of triggers.  This seemed devastating, as I was having a really hard time functioning at work, teaching, with the nonstop genital arousal/pain.  He said the discontinuation of SSRI meds can cause this problem from a decline in serotonin, though I was not taking any such meds.  Later I would learn that estrogen boosts serotonin and that a decline in estrogen produces similar effects to SSRI discontinuation. I went to another functional medicine specialist who retested me and claimed I was estrogen dominant; that I needed progesterone cream.  I just did not believe this, as my breasts were now deflating/sagging, and I was losing more hair and suffering hot flashes.  My mother was fully menopausal at age 44.  I told every doctor this information.  My periods were no longer regular after years of clockwork. I SUFFERED for months and months, trying to manage my symptoms with diet, stress reduction, and nutritional supplements.  I contemplated suicide, but I have a child with a disability, and that kept me from carrying out a drastic end to my unrelenting pain. I finally scheduled an appointment at a big, respectable medical group in my state with an endocrinologist.  She said I most likely have an underlying neurological disorder, such as dysautonomia (a disorder of the autonomic nervous system) which is aggravated by hormone fluctuations.  She iimmediately indicated that I NEEDED ESTROGEN and prescribed me a small dose of a bioidentical estrogen patch to supplment my progestin pill.  She shared that she has seen estrogen literally stop many strange neurological symptoms in menopausal women.  I decided to wait until classes were out to try it.  By this point, it was six months since the start of this hell.   I tried the patch, and within one day, my symptoms stopped, but I did experience side effects of nausea and migraine.  The migraine did not stop, even after weeks, and so I eventually removed the patch because it was intolerable.  I noticed that my skin has sagged significantly in the past year - all over my body, but especially on my face, stomach, upper arms, and inner thighs.  Also, my body composition has really changed, with a major loss of muscle tone and excess jello-like fat everywhere.  I weigh under 110 pounds, but my butt now hangs and jiggles because it is complete fat, no muscle.  My mom has saggy skin and osteoporosis.  I am concerned this is happening to me.  It is so hard to take at this age especially. I have a history of autioimmune-type disorders including antiphospholipid antibody disorder, endometriosis, sun allergy, and chronic, systemic hives. I felt okay for a while off the patch, but soon the symptoms returned.  I went back on the patch, but a different brand.  It helped again, right away, and for about three months I felt great.  I even signed up to work on my doctorate degree.   Then, I made a huge mistake.  I thought I was seeing melasma developing on my face, and I discontinued the patch.  I was operating from a place of fear due to my OCD and Body Dysmorphia.  This was so stupid.  I was okay for about a month, and then all of the symptoms came back.  I was not able to easily stabilize on my original dose.  I incerased above my full dose, per doctor's instructions, but it did not cover my symptoms.  So, I had increased up to .0625, and no relief.  I was still having hot flashes, night sweats, and anxiety, etc. My doctor said I could go on a low-dose oral contraceptive since I am not fully menopausal yet, and that's what I did this past week.  It has worked to stop the symptoms, but I have some nausea and headache again. My questions for you are about the hormone therapy: I need to make a long-term decision about hormone therapy.  I would prefer bio-identicals, however, it seemed that the doses were quite low for the level of symptoms I am experiencing.  I am concerned that as my hormones continue to drop, they may not be sufficient.  I am trying to keep working and functioning through this all - ugh! I am moving toward the end of peri, I think, so it is a time between oral contraceptives vs bioidenticals.  It is so hard to make a decision with so much conflicting information out there.  Synthetics are supposed to be bad and bioidenticals good, but yet, the doses are so low of the bioidenticals.  They are HRT doses, not contraceptive doses, which apparently, some younger women really need for the severity of symptoms.   Due to my age and severity of symptoms, the bioientical doses do not seem to work for me consistently.  I could have gone as high as .1, which I did not, and maybe I should have before jumping on a birth control pill.  Also, even though I took bioidentical estrogen, I was still on the synthetic progestin, as my doctor did not want to change two variables at the same time.  Also, functional medicine specialists seem to label every woman as estrogen dominant no matter what.  That is surely not the case for me, and I suffered longer for not having the estrogen, which is the ONLY thing that has helped my symptoms. Meanwhile, my skin is SAGGING.  Oh my gosh!  Please tell me this is normal.  I feel so bad.  It is affecting my self esteem.  I have also read that skin sagging on the outside is consistent with osteoporosis on the inside.  My nails are also brittle and dry, and they used to be so strong.   So it is important to me to take a hormone therapy that helps these issues.  Can anyone give direction on this?  Bioidenticals supposedly preseerve/restore collagen, but will the oral contraceptive do the same?  I cannot seem to find information about this.  The oral contraceptive is supposed to protect against further bone loss. I am seeing a dermatologist soon about my skin issues, just to rule out any other possible causes.  I cannot tell you the hit to my self esteem over this, which fuels my body dysmorphic disorder and anxiety, not to mention post-traumatic stress from the relationship with a psychopath who picked on my appearance. Trying to gather enough information to determine if I should stick with the oral contraceptive for now or switch to a high dose bio-identical therapy (which is still very low dose), especially as it relates to sagging skin and osteopporosis prevention. Please help, anyone.  I am exhausted physically and emotionally.  It's been hard to find answers to questions that will help me make a decision.  Often information from one source/doctor is in direct conflict with that from another.  I do not know a soul who has suffered with meopausal symptoms this severe, especially at this age.   Thanks so much for reading, and I am thaniful for this place...."

Then back in May I started experiencing a burning mouth, which then transitioned to hives on my face. After a week I gave in and went to a doc in the box. They gave me prednisone and it cleared up in a few days. I went to a regular GP said the hives probably had nothing to do with menopause, but was most likely a food allergy. I have eliminated so much from my diet and yet the hives are pretty constant now. I will be seeing an allergist soon I hope, but was wondering if anyone else has experienced this or heard of this as menopause symptom."

The weirdest thing I can also feel a pulsing heartbeat in the shoulder blade when it's aching. I do have gerd and gastritis , I don't know if its coming from the stomach . Also, Im having heart palpitations also and the palps gets worse if I move around too much. I went to my Dr a few days ago and he said I was very deficient in calcium and magnesium. He started me on supplements , it seem to get better for a couple of days but triggered again. I just took magnesium and it seem to lighten the pain in that area but the pain seem to move to another area but still not so severe like before. I am so nervous and cant seem to get comfort.

Trying to figure out all these wiered feelings, emotions, sensations, thoughts worrying if I'm going mad, and is it the perimenopause...?? Everyone has been so lovely and supportive, and it is helping just knowing other women are experiencing the same problems or similar. But another of my weird and wonderfully horrible symptoms is I seem to be scared of most things, it sounds weird I know, but it's like all of a sudden things that wouldn't even enter my head, or you would just do so without thinking because it's just a normal part of your day, routine etc... All of a sudden becomes frightening to do, feel a nervousness or apprehension about doing something. And your mind jumps to thinking all kinds of weird and wonderful scenarios that might happen if you do it. Sounds redicolous I know and irrational, but it's like your mind runs away again with you and you just think something terrible will happen. Or just fearing been on your own, I'm scared to take the dogs out at dark because I'm convinced something horrible will happen or someone is lurking in the bushes. I even see my shadow and that freaks me out and scares me, and then I'm analysing why this is happening to me... Does anyone else have this, is this a possibility its hormone imbalance to?? As its terrifying me along with all the other symptoms. Or when I go to bed ill be thinking theres a creepy gost, or any noise and my hearts in my mouth and adrenalin pumping through my veins. I feel like a 2yr old again, its redicolous and don't understand what it happening... 🤔😕😭"
bev27429,2018-10-26T04:34+00:00,The Ups and Downs are SO Hard!,"I have been dealing with perimenopausal hell for over a year. The emotional symptoms have been awful (numbing depression, feeling detached from reality with almost a feeling that I am hallucinating, terrible thoughts and images swirling through my mind...) Last year, I had periods of about a week with virtually no emotional reprieve. In the past several months, I have noticed that the paralyzing depression never lasts more than about two days, before I get some level of relief. For me, the hardest part is never knowing if I am going to be up or down. I just had two lovely back to back days where I felt like my old self: energized, positive, productive, and looking forward to life. Today, the depression has returned. I am able to get through my day, but it is so painful, and the contrast between feeling good and feeling like an emotional zombie is so hard to understand and deal with. Are other women going through the same? I just pray that the end is near. Any supportive responses would be greatly appreciated. Many thanks, Bev"

I've got terrible gas now and burping a lot and my stomach is so bloated. Initially I just thought I've got a bit of acid causing this as ive had that before, it comes and goes. I feel quite fatigued and my tummy is still aching and back is too. I've noticed i need to wee a lot more and my urine is quite cloudy. I'm now wondering if the backache and tummy ache are some kind of urinary/kidney infection. I used to get cystitis a lot but ive got no pain when i urinate. I'm reluctant to go Dr's as I'm never away from the place and I fear he will say there is nothing wrong as per. I stupidly googled my symptoms and now I'm scared its kidneys and serious.

It is three weeks since my last period was due and seven weeks since I was last on . Before when this happened I had lots of symptoms and this time it seems to be following that pattern . A mixture of things that come and go , headaches , migraine , lethargy , achy and flu like , nausea , upset stomach , ibs pain and so the list goes on . Is this all normal ? Im wondering that as I am now missing months the hormones are all over the place , so causing all these problems . Over the years i have suffered from bouts of ibs , so I guess thats to be expected . The thing is I also feel like I am going to come on , but nothing happens , just that continuing ache and unsettled stomach feeling . Anyone get this ?"

Guest,2018-10-20T07:16+00:00,"Insomnia, menopause and started HRT","Hi, just started HRT - ELLESTE Duet 1mg version. Had it orescribed nearly a year ago for mild depression (didnt want antidepressants) which i think was related to perimenopause but then, waiting for my cycle to start, i was given a SAD lamp which really helped my mood for a bit. I've always been a poor sleeper with regular bad nights and have been taking melatonin for a few years which has helped a bit. But a few month ago insomnia got really bad and melatonin seemed to stop working though i am still taking it. Not falling asleep until 4am or dawn night after night and then trying to function at work, and feeling rubbish all the time. So have now started the hrt because i read the worsening insomnia could be menopausal too. Does anyone know how long it takes to work for insomnia? AM 1 week in and the sleep hasn't really improved. Am i expecting too much too soon? Im 50 BTW. Thanks"
lorraine21138,2018-10-16T11:43+00:00,Frustrated! Male GP,"So frustrated! I am 51 years old, my periods are all over the place, I've missed it completely some months, bled really heavily at times, had spotting between periods. I overheat at night, have times where I ache all over, my hair is falling out in handfuls and my memory and mental capacity are awful. I went to see my GP recently due to a badly aching back. I explained that, due to the increased muscular aches and pains I'm getting, I was pretty sure it was due to approaching menopause. To be fair, he did arrange blood tests and a pelvic scan and I was told to ring him back a week later. Everything is normal apparently - obviously I'm pleased. However, after telling me he 'shouldn't have done a FSH test' he said it was normal which means I am NOT pre-menopausal. I explained that I had actually come on my period 48 hours after the bloods were taken - which would have skewed the result I'm sure, but he was just rushing to get me off the phone. I asked about my hair loss, he said that if I was getting stressed about it, that would cause hair loss. I only spoke to him again because he asked me to - I was hoping for some tips on how to cope with pre-menopause because, despite the FSH result, I have no doubt that this is what I'm experiencing, but he couldn't wait to get me off the phone. I'm sure he thinks I'm some sort of hypochondriac - but then again, I'd been suffering with stomach pains for over ten years and told it was 'all in my mind' until a different doctor checked me out and it was found that I was coeliac! Now on a gluten free diet guess what? No stomach pains. Where can I get some helpful advice about approaching menopause? Any suggestions please?"

After suffering low back ache for a couple of weeks that ached all night unless I switched positions and at times radiated through to the front of my pelvis/hips and sometimes down my legs I visited the GP. I'd read lower back ache is common in peri menopause. Anyway, as half expected GP was next to useless. Told me backache was NOT a symptom...I'm sure it is, as it seems worse around the time I'll get a period - if I'm getting one that month of course. (After a lifetime of very regular periods they are all over the place, some don't come at all - but according to my GP I am NOT pre-menopausal - even though I'm flippin' 51 years old with loads of other symptoms!!!)

Went through a patch of hot flushes, still get them but not as bad. And now suffering really bad with anxiety and started getting panic attacks, having really weird feelings, sensations, emotions, feeling dizzy, disoriented, almost feel disconnected sometimes like things don't feel real. It's really scaring me, feels like my brain runs away with me, scary thoughts, then feel like I'm loosing my mind or terrified I'm going to loose it. Also last few months iv had severe irritability, mood swings, feel low, severe pain in hips and joints and now spots again. Feel like I'm a teenager again. And I'm 46 next month.

I had unbearable sweats day and night and exhausted I went to my GP. I was told - recommended I stay on HRT until 50 to protect my bones...I understand the logic. The pills caused nausea and I came off (rebound of menopausal symptoms) and have been on patches for 4 months. I find they sometimes catch on clothing and also after 4/5 days I get a n itchy rash where it sticks. Does anyone else find this?? I take FEMSeven sequi. I don't know what to do. I'm a really anxious person (worse since menopause), I don't have sweats anymore on HRT but I feel I should come off soon and due to the irritation of patches, I need to try coming off soon......scared of symptoms returning. I asked my GP who said I could try cutting patches in half to come off slowly but it's really hard to do. Has anyone tried it and can offer advice? Menopause is such a shock, these forums are vital. There's not enough support for women. Reading these forum posts is at least reassuring that others have similar symptoms."

Indifferent,2018-10-14T16:05+00:00,Jaw Pain like i have never felt before,"Hi ladies...I am hoping someone can help me with this worry. I will start from the beginning. About ten years ago I had a root canal done on one of my top left molars...due to a toothache. For many years after it would cause pain and my face would hurt, for a few days around my period. Two years ago I finally had it pulled because it seemed to really be bothering me all the time. But getting it pulled didn't stop the 'toothache' Fast forward to the past month...We bought a hot tub. Started with Bromine but i reacted to it with burning skins and especially in my genital area within two days so we switched right over to chlorine. I started getting headaches within a few days of using it but didn't even think about the hot tub being the cause. Finally about a week ago, I got out of the hot tub and my face swelled and I felt like I had been viciously assaulted...lol. So I stayed out of the hot tub and the headache subsided...but as usual my jaw still ached. I have not gone in the hot tub since. Then last night...Oh my Lord...it brought me to my knees. It was like a nerve pain that I have never felt before. Came on for two minutes at a time...and it was so bad that I was almost in tears but I am tougher than that...so I just sat on the sofa and bounced my legs tried to alleviate the horrendous pain. It was as bad as labour...maybe worse. When i tried to lay down it came back over and over with a vengence. I finally decided to try and sleep sitting up. Today I have a dull ache in my jaw as usual...and the back of my neck/head has a tension to it that is not quite a headache. Have any of you experienced this? I am definitely going to see both my dentist and doctor next week. I have not been to my doctor in many years....lol he is going to be shocked to see me. But i cannot live with this pain. There is absolutely no way. I have never felt anything that excrutiating in my life. And quite frankly...after reading google i am little scared Thanks for listening."

Its when I eat that my stomach balloons. It feels hard and uncomfortable. I am 48 and still having periods but I never thought I suffered from anxiety but I do now, my hair is thinning, my joints ache and have pretty much a large selection of symptoms on the peri-menopausal list in this forum. So has anybody else have this bloating? Its been particularly troublesome the week before a period and during. What do you take? If I am up and about, its not too bad. Its when I sit down and I do have a desk job which makes it more difficult to cope with. I walk an hour a day, swim once a week and occasionally hit the gym. So what else can I do to alleviate this?"

Finny2018,2018-10-05T16:04+00:00,Wild Yam Cream (“natural” PROGESTERONE) for Depression – my 2nd Month Update!,"I experienced what the experts call Perimenopause Depression for the very first time at age 49. I had NO idea what was happening to me. I had experienced a feeling of being a ""little down"" after the birth of my kids; but nothing like what I experienced when I missed my first period and my hormones plummeted in June of 2018. Click here to view image I have had or currently experience most of the 66 symptoms (off and on) noted here on this forum…there are SO many more symptoms; but that list is a great starting point for sure. The depression I experienced for the first time (along with anxiety) was the hardest – as I couldn’t “cope” or handle all that was happening to me at an accelerated rate. After hours and hours and weeks of research on this forum, I decided to try the over the counter “natural” Progesterone Cream (Wild Yam). I started the cream on August 9, 2018 after getting my saliva test results (it’s a kit you can order online and return in the mail!). Many people had shared that my symptoms were indicative of a progesterone deficiency; however, my little prideful self wanted to have some sort of “concrete” baseline. These results can be all over the board as our hormones fluctuate dramatically. My results showed an almost rock bottom level of progesterone. I had ordered the cream online prior to getting my results so that as soon as I had my numbers I could start the cream. I have just completed my 2nd cycle on this cream (August and September); the depression and anxiety? I feel SO much better! Oh my. I am so GRATEFUL! The final decision for me to try the cream was after perusing a wonderful website on the Wild Yam Cream from a company out of Australia.  If this cream is placebo – I will take the placebo, LOL! I currently take a multi-vitamin, Vitamin D (magnesium Spray here and there) and the Progesterone Cream (I did 14 days in August and 21 days in September). My Meno journey may be 1 year, 2 years, 8 years, 15 years or forever – I don’t know. I have the blessing of knowing women in their 80's who have been doing the hormones (creams, pills, patches - natural, synthetic etc) for 10, 20 30 years etc. My 85 year old friend has been on them since her twenties after a hysterectomy.  What have I learned when this all hit for me in June? I’ve learned that for the first time I am having to make some decisions....I am open to trying natural things, supplements, BHRT, anti-depressants, anti-anxiety etc.  I won’t give up! If something works for a while and it needs to be increased or I need to try something new…I will. That’s what this forum has given me; a VAST treasure trove of ideas, experiences, things that work, and on and on. The women here give me the strength and courage to press on by sharing their stories and hence why I will keep sharing as well. We are in this journey together!"

elizabeth49339,2018-10-07T14:58+00:00,Unwanted intimate feelings - anxious depressed PLEASE respond if you can relate.,"I’ve been perimenopausal for almost 10 years with eight of those using 500 mg of natural progesterone. my own decision. Transdermal  im 50 years old in January  I’m due on one of my many periods but due to high Progesterone it’s never more than spotting  which I’m experiencing now.  Six days ago I woke up normally happy but feeling horny which has been a rare pms symptom over the last ten years I didn’t think too much of it and sorted myself out.  Later that day I started getting mild twinges down below. Not pain. A sensation of arousal which was distracting. I woke up the next day with the same thing alternating with shivers up my spine and upper buttocks as if from someone nibbling my neck and it sends sensitive sensations down your spine.  Three times now I’ve had what can only be described as an anxiety attack/hot flush/arousal lasting anything from 10 to 30 minutes  I lie on my bed heart pounding and wait mind racing with anxiety but feeling aroused down below.  Im spotting atm my breasts are aching and sore more than usual, I’ve got upset stomach (poops) which I also had for the first time exactly a month ago today. Spots, palpitations, anxiety, depression, stabbing pain inside vagina (this is usual before a period) peeing a lot, hot flushes, cold then hot, basically PMS but x 10 and with these disturbing vaginal and body sensations of arousal for 6 days. (And stomach upset which is a new symptom)  Im aware of the “sexsurge” I’ve read about that some women in their late 40s early 50s whose libido goes through the roof. But I don’t have a sex drive and never have.ive been responsive to stimulus but not physical sensations of lust without stimulation from touch or visual. Not sexually actively with my partner as we dont have a Sex drive and we were both fine with this.  Ive written on another meno website and some women told me I should think myself lucky because most women lose their libido. I was told to stop over thinking and ignore the sensations.  A few kind ladies told me they had similar problems down below with one woman saying she did not worry but her privates felt so swollen even her underwear was difficult to wear. She went to the doctors who told her a few peri menopause women developed this and offered her nerve blocking drug which she declined and the issue went after 3 weeks.  Another lady had the feelings for a while was convinced it was PGAD permanent genital arousal disorder but after some months it was bettter and in hindsight she felt it was a combination of sexsurge\PGAD but again said it was much better and for the most part behind her. The third lady contacted me privately to say she had it along with itching burning skin to her head and body. She also said it was all but gone now adding it was at its worst when her oestrogen was rock bottom or too high.  Ive joined a secret PGAD Facebook page but in all honesty I don’t want to convince myself or let others to convince me this is what I have because it’s a notoriously difficult disorder to diagnose and treat with suicides noted.  Im so very depressed"
Guest,2018-09-11T14:23+00:00,My fellow dizzy girls...,"came across this info...interesting read...  Migraine disorders are more prevalent among women than men. The ovarian neurosteroids play an important role in this sex difference by modulating neurotransmitter systems involving migraine pathogenesis. During perimenopause, unlike the postmenopausal period, women are under unstable fluctuations of ovarian neurosteroid levels. Such fluctuations might be an important interval-specific trigger for activating migraines. Along with migraine headache, dizziness is one of the most common complaints of perimenopause. A significant portion of this dizziness may be caused by vestibular migraine that has heterogeneous clinical features with dizziness and/or migraine headache. Because of this variation in phenomenology, the symptom of dizziness and vertigo during perimenopause is frequently misclassified as being a nonspecific climacteric symptom or having psychological origin. The recognition of vestibular migraine and its heterogeneous clinical presentations are important to understand, differentiate and correctly diagnose the symptom of dizziness and vertigo during perimenopausal transition. Further, recognition of the steroid influences on migraine genesis will lead to improved treatment regimens for vertigo from migraine."

I went about 120 days with no period... but then they returned with a vengeance, some very short cycles, long periods, the works-- but the one nice part of all this was the hot flashes (which for me are mostly just night sweats and a few in the very end of the day) were pretty mild the whole time... Anyway, the cycles are now getting a bit longer again (like 35 days) and suddenly the flashes/sweats are back... The night ones in particular seem lengthier and more intense than before.  AND my tinnitus is going crazy... I had a loud noise exposure about a year ago, but had been gradually getting better... Now it's going nuts again and I don't know if it's the hormonal shifts or just the fact that I watched too much TV news during the hearings last week??  (The TV really sets it off, something about the tinniness of TV speakers.  Normally I watch very quietly w. closed captioning.)  Anyway-- anyone have this experience where hot flashes came, went, and came again?  Does this mean MAYBE I am finally getting toward the end of all this?

I’ve been doing well when it comes to dizziness/vertigo, for probably almost a year now. Today suddenly I felt that thing where your forehead right between the eyes gets really tight and it feels like you’re eyes are going to go unfocused. I went to my room and laid down and then had a, I would say minor, dizzy spell.  Still feeling “tight” around the eyes now, about ten minutes later, and feel “off”. I do notice my digestion is a bit wonky today, like gassy and feeling like I need to go to the bathroom. TMI but bringing that part up because I do notice a connection between “weird head” feelings and digestive issues. Anyone else?  Curious what your opinions or experiences are on these things.  I’m wondering if it’s the “close to end of period hormones”......or the “weird digestive gassy issues” causing it.  Thanks!"

theresa53424,2018-10-01T21:17+00:00,"We know our bodies, we know how it was before menopause came along.","Today is one of those days where I just want to b***h slap the professionals. I work in health care too, and the professionals have admitted they are not educated enough on Menopause. The stories I have been reading from women these last two months have been grueling. I have cried many times reading what you're all going through. Its the same story after another..... What's it going to take for these health care professionals to start educating themselves on Menopause. This is not a laughing matter, this is serious s**t. 30% of men leave their spouses during menopause, there has been a 45% increase rate of women committing suicide in the last 15 years over menopause, many women can't work; They have been forced to quit, get fired, collect disability, short term disability, go out on FMLA. Whats it going to take to get ALL MEDICAL CARE STAFF on board with this? I sound p****d, and I am, but I'm justified. Enough is enough..... I'm more educated then the professionals. I've spent over $300.00 in the last 2 weeks just on natural products because one, I'm allergic to anti depressants and my OB refuses to put me on hormones due to past history issues. I'd rather live a damn normal life for the next 10 years and feel somewhat normal then to have to worry about the consequences later. I know my body better than anyone else. But yet you want to rule my feelings, emotions, and deprive me of having a normal life? The system is effed up! And honestly, I'm so fed up..... My advice, because that's all I got right now; Be your own advocate and don't be afraid to speak out. I don't sleep, I have extreme anxiety, panic attacks, fainted, no bladder control, barely eat, afraid something will trigger my anxiety, I live off vitamins, cream, CBD, vitamin D, Magnesium, and so much more. I've become paranoid, living in fear constantly, and yet all blood work and other tests come back normal. Oh and lets not forget we're being told, no caffeine, no alcohol, no cigarettes, no sugar, etc. BLAH BLAH BLAH.....  Oh and then there's prayer, yep, been there done that too. Yep just commit me, I could use a damn vacation. Vent done....."

It progressed with heart palpitations, weakness, the internal vibrations and the list goes on.  I've been to an ENT, an opthalmologist, 2 neurologists (MRI of the spine and head and EMG and ANT testing), a cardiologist (EKG and stress test, and electrophysiologist, physical therapist that specializes in dizziness, Infectious Disease doctor (to test for Lyme), an accupuncturist, chiropractor, and now.. because of these discussions.. an OB/GYN to check my hormones.. She did find that my levels are way off, but unlike everyone else here.. I'm POST menopausal.. 6 months now.. and no doctor has found anything.  I'm at my wits end.. I can almost deal with the vibration.. but the days that my hands shake and my neck feels weak (head shaky).. and my legs feel like they're going to collapse underneath me.. and then with the daily occasional brief dizziness.... I'm getting really annoyed... My job is 40 miles from my house and I'm having to get rides because I'm scared to death something will happen worse than the 1 or 2 second dizzy feeling.. Sooooooooo tired of this.  I don't really want to take hormones because of what they can do to you.. But I do have an internal estrogen cream that I use for thinned tissue inside.. I had stopped using it just because..well.. it's kinda messy.. but I think I'll start again to see if it helps with these other symptoms...  I haven't read where anyone else here is experiencing the dizziness."

audra86673,2018-10-03T16:12+00:00,Question about official menopause timing,Good Morning!  So I popped on here this morning and was reading some responses to new posts and came across one that mentioned you are officially menopausal if you go a year without a period at age 50 or older and that it's 2 years with no period if you're younger than 50 when you start missing periods. So I was 49 (49 and 9mos) when I started missing periods. I have not had one since. It's been 12 months for me with no period. I assumed I was officially menopausal but now I'm not sure...? Do I have to go another 12 months before I can call myself menopausal or do I only need to make it to my 51st bday - so 16 months with no period or am I officially in menopause now? I'd love it if someone could shed some light on this for me. Thanks! 😊

And last night I drank  a soft drink that I love to drink and then it started tasting funny and the glass started smelling funny.  I put it down and came back to it later and the glass smelled normal and the drink tasted good.  What is happening to my sense of taste??  I know that my Grandmother complained of things not tasting right.  She would add sugar to just about everything she ate because of it. Even chocolate doesn't taste like it did to me anymore.  Is it old age? What is wrong with me??  I won't give up my Pop-tarts and chocolate!   Lori"

Jen2541,2018-09-25T19:30+00:00,feels like a furball in my throat!,"Hi all, I have been struggling with what I've assumed is reflux since February.  I have had more traditional ""heartburn"" before where I feel burning in my chest.  This has all been in my neck and throat.  It started as a ""lump in the throat"" feeling and has progressed to feeling like there is a furball in there.  I also get soreness around collarbone/clavicles.  I have had ENT exam of throat, CT scan of neck, thyroid scan-- nothing.  What I haven't had is an endoscopy (of my esophagus) because I had one two years ago that was fine,  but I wasn't having these kinds of symptoms, or having them EVERY DAY then, just occasional heartburn.  I have been taking Prevacid 30 mg + Zantac at night (and recently tried adding in Gaviscon Advance at night also) since April and feel like they are doing nothing.  I have been off caffeine and alcohol except for very occasional white wine for ages (also off chocolate, citrus, and all the usual).  Garlic has become a real problem.  I love to cook and have been so depressed about this.  Oddly I rarely have stomach or intestinal pain or lower bowel problems.  But I do feel I get full easily and burp a lot.  I have been trying to eat much less and more slowly.  I can't drink much water with or after meals, and it has to be warm.  I just don't know what to do at this point.  I hate the PPIs (Prevacid) and want to get off them, but fear I may need to take MORE of them instead.  I think I would need an endoscopy again before the dr. would prescribe a higher dose, though.  I sometimes wonder if taking 15 mg in the AM and 15 mg at night would help.  I have also tried digestive enzymes without success.  Slippery elm can help a little bit.  Also I sleep on a wedge.  I am going nuts with this and would love to know if anyone has had any success dealing with similar issues!"

Prior to that I have skipped a month here and there.  I am on day 34 now.  I took Lexapro from June 5th, to last dose Sept 13th.  Then, started amitripyline for migraines last week.  Has anybody ever stopped an AD, started another and had it mess up their cycle?  I am thinking it will come any minute...all the symptoms are there!  But, I have had the ghost period months too.  Or maybe it will come tomorrow! I dunno!"

I know I should be on a higher dose but I don't want to be on them for the rest of my life so I feel it will be easier to come of them on a lower dose. Researchers needs to be done on the ""S""(I can't use the word or the moderator will delete this)rates among menopausal women. Yesterday I was fine. Thursday I even went out to a reception.

Click here to view image I'm not sure if I need to list my resource when I'm sharing this information? Here is an excerpt... 'A migraine is a vascular headache that involves the excessive dilation or contraction of the brain's blood vessels. Common and classic are the two types of Migraines: 1. centered at the temple  2. behind one ear ...produces a throbbing pain that may last for 2 to 72 hours. Alternatively it can begin at the back of the head and then spreads to one entire side of the head.  NAUSEA, VOMITING, BLURRED VISION, AND TINGLING AND NUMBNESS in the LIMBS that can last up to eighteen hours usually accompany a migraine.'

sn21848,2018-09-29T00:57+00:00,6 years at least in Postmenopause and I'm weary...,"I'm completely exhausted and I am hardly doing anything. I have had the whole list of issues since I figured out I was done with menopause when I went off birth control 6 years ago. Fatigue, lack of sleep, constipation, memory issues, etc. etc. etc. I have an endocrinologist appointment October 30th. I have been on HRT but not working so hot now and I have a fibroid in my uterus that started to grow a bit. I finally asked for a thyroid scan which I guess i forgot to ask for along the way. I have multiple benign nodules on both sides of my thyroid even though my thyroid numbers always come back normal. My mom had thyroid problems too. And it seems my bone density went from really good 4 years ago to osteopenia in my hips joints plus it seems I am starting to have problems with my teeth.   My psychiatrist for meds upped my antidepressant a bit but it is still a low dose. I'm not sure if that is making me groggy and feel worse but I couldn't stand the nervousness. I swear I am having a big pity party. If at least I could focus brain wise I'd be a bit happier. I feel like I am getting slower and slower and I have a lot to do. I'm pushing through right now. I am just hoping that the doctor doesn't think I'm cocoa for cocoa puffs because I'm so done feeling this miserable."

In the beginning I was going crazy thinking what's wrong and countless doctors visits to find answers. But it all boils down to hormones doing its dance causing havoc in my life. I tried low dose birth control, but didn't help much. I stopped everything, the pills, doctors visits, googling symptoms. I am trying to make peace with it , it's here for who knows how long but hoping at some point it will pass. Just taking multivitamins, exercise, eat right and trying to live as normal as possible despite all the anxiety, mood swings, headaches. What are you doing that seem to help?"

The crazy thing about this is sternum pain comes about a week before my period and the chest pain comes right at the beginning of my period or right around ovulation.  I have skipped a few months, but it usually shows up during this time of the cycle.  I also have globes sensation in my throats on and off.  I have had all the heart tests offered, I have had tons of blood work, I have had ultra sounds done and so far nothing.  In about a week I will be doing a barium swallow test to see what may be causing the globes sensation.  The doctors are suggesting and endoscopy, to check and see if anything is going on in my esophagus and stomach....they think gerd.....but I have no heart burn....Just wondering if anyone of you ladies come across this symptom during  these certain times and have you found anything helpful.  I have switched to a low acid diet, I sleep on a wedge pillow,  I eat small meals and I stop eating3 to 4 hours before bed.....So I am not sure this is gerd or if it is a hormonal thing causing muscles to spasm."

Now, 3 weeks in, very low mood, fuzzy head, feeling fat but libido improved (too high a price to pay for that!).

From the age of 25 I decided to go on the depot injection, thinking this was a great option for me as I was very career oriented. After 4 years I decided that I needed to come off it and give my body a break. After 4 years of little to no periods I decided it was time to find out what the problem was..... I have suffered bad bouts of depression so I just put my symptoms down to that. I moved abroad to escape the stress and to start a new chapter in my life. I went to see a gynaecologist and had a full exam and bloods done. The internal scan showed small ovaries and very thin lining of the uterus and there are my bloods. free T4 1.02  FSH 95.04 LH. 18.23 Estradiol 10 prolactin 96.46 TSH.  1.75  since ce I have no periods I was unable to have the test on day three of my cycle.

Lrowley77,2018-09-06T19:56+00:00,Somebody please help before I lose my mind,"Hi all Just stumbled across this group while Googling symptoms.  I’m 45.  For the last two years I’ve had so many strange symptoms I feel like I’m losing my mind. I have health anxiety so I’m always thinking the worst.  GP is fed up with me and puts everything down to anxiety.   Symptoms much worse the last six months or so.   Two main things worrying me right now: 1). Last month I had electric shock type shooting pains in right breast.  They would happen several times a day, startle me and last for a few seconds.  Went to GP and she said she could feel nothing of concern.  Those have stopped now, but instead I’m getting pinching type pains in the same breast when I lean or stretch a certain way.  Kind of feels like a pinchy nerve pain.  2). I had what I thought was ovulation pains on left side this week. It’s the right time in my cycle.  But they’ve lasted for three days now and still hurting, though not as much as the first couple of days.  Is it normal to get ovulation pain for that long?  I’ve also got horrendous lower back pain.  My other symptoms include: Joint pain, especially hands and feet Muscle aches Back pain, upper and lower Blurred vision and dry eyes Ear pressure and tinnitus Palpitations and skipped beats Chest pain Sore intestines Numbness in legs and fingertips Weakness Crushing tiredness that I have to stop what I’m doing and sleep Heat intolerance Insomnia and waking early Night sweats occasionally Tailbone pain My periods are regular and cause no trouble.   Recently I’ve had thyroid ultrasound, two upper abdo ultrasounds, bloods, diabetes test, all normal.   I’m so scared right now.  I can’t get to the GP for another week and even then I think they will just send me away again.  Can anyone else relate to these symptoms, especially the breast and ovulation pain? Thank you for reading if you got this far."

jamie50513,2016-04-02T17:59+00:00,"Internal Tremors, Shaking, Jitters","Hello Lovlies, Anytime I come across useful information I like to share. The only way to get through this ""transition"" in the best possible way is to stay informed as to what is going on with our bodies. Being as though every woman is different, what may work for one may not work for the other. But knowledge is key to being able to live our lives the best and healthiest way possible. With that being said, I came across some information on the internal shaking and jitters. Now this info may not apply to you, but if if does, by all means take it and do more research on your own to help yourself. Some of the first symtpoms that I expierenced that started to really ramp up anxiety for me is the racing heart and the internal shaking. I felt the the shaking in my chest and stomach mainly, but I could feel it all over. At times I would get the racing heart with it. The shakiness and jitters first. We already know that the decline in estradiol can affect blood sugars, and digestive issues. For some the shakiness and jitters can be due to the blood sugars and dietary changes can help to stable that during peri/meno if you are not a true diabetic. It can also be due to anxiety and adrenaline surges. The other possibility can be digestive related. Since the digestive system is affected by declining hormones we digest food slower and have more gas than we usually do as well as an excess of stomach acid. I since have been diagnosed with GERD as many women do in peri/meno and I do have excessive gas and stomach acid which causes that burning feeling. For me what has been causing that internal shaky feeling in my chest and stomach is stomach acid putting pressure behind the breast bone which irritates the vagus nerve that can cause the anxiety type symptoms. If I chew a tums or take an acid reflux tablet the internal shakiness and jitters stop. Drinking chamomile tea, ginger capsules or tea, tums, rolaids, omeprazole, zantac, cal/mags or whareverse you choose to use calms the stomach acid, calms the vagus nerve and neutralizes excess gas. Also when the vagus nerve is irritated it can cause heart palps and that is why when your reflux is acting up the excess acid pushing the vagus nerve can start palps. Now again this may not be the case for all, but it may be for some. So I thought that I would share the info just in case it may help you."

I constantly feel like my throat is going to close up and i wake up at night ferling like something is stuck there. I have to say i had a gastroscopy a year ago but nothing in my throat. I had half my thyroid removed a year ago also but thyroid function normal. I do know about burning mouth syndrome but does it affect the throat? Im officially post meno August just gone. Blood tests revealed my ovaries have shut down. For those of you that dont know me here already I had a 10 year peri hell with every symptom then some. Im realky worried ive got something in my throat as my anxiety is huge again!!!! Really hate this. Anyone experienced this x

I have always been petite and been able to eat anything without gaining weight. Seems it has caught up with me and I have the middle age spread. Keen to know if any of you ladies changed your diet and if it helped your symptoms. My main issues are anxiety and the dreaded off balance feeling. Thank you

Guest,2018-09-18T16:45+00:00,It’s official!,"Hi ladies!  Just came back from my new obgyn.  I have finally been heard.  Yes, indeed I am in perimenopause.  Estrogen deficient for sure!  It is looking as if I need to be on a combo BCP.  It is a 90 day regiment, basically a period 3-4 x per year.  She is just contacting my cardiologist because of some prior heart testing, but that should all be fine!  I went back afterwards and saw perimenopause listed as a diagnosis...I cried a little 😊 For my dizzy friends... I am going to try (again) lower dose amitripyline 10mg.  The thought is if the migraines can be controlled and I get more sleep...hopefully the vertigo will lessen.  Apparently, he wants me to try vestibular physical therapy too.  It does appear to be associated with either the migraines or the BPV...in any event it is upsetting my inner ear ( vestibular system).  I am going to give that and the BCP 3 months.  If my vertigo is not solved...making an appointment in our major city to see a nuerotologist and get proper balance testing done...spinning chairs, etc.   You will all be proud of me...it is raining like crazy here...I drove in terrible downpours and didn’t have a meltdown!  Today...good day...check 😉"
debster222,2018-09-22T22:33+00:00,Periods After Menopause,"I know there have been other threads on this subject, but they're very old and I feel like what I'm experiencing is a bit different.  I stopped having periods over 5 years ago, but I've had was seems to be a regular cycle each month for about 3 months now.  When I say regular, I mean the mood swings, cramping and all the other stuff that goes along with it, but with very light bleeding.  So light that a panty liner is sufficient.  It goes on for a few days and than it stops, along with the symptoms.  When it first happened, I freaked.  I started thinking about it and thought...maybe that's why I was in such a crappy mood a few days ago.  I'm a very easy going, patient person and I was raging, which is totally NOT me.  I am on workman's comp for a torn rotator cuff and have not worked since last October.  My employer took away my health insurance, so I haven't gone to the doctor.  Simply can't afford it right now.  So, I'm just wondering if anyone else has had this same thing happen and if you went and got checked, what were the results?"

tammy40126,2018-09-16T13:36+00:00,I think I am going crazy,"Hi everyone,  I am new to this forum and so glad I found it!  I am 52 and one year ago I had a hysterectomy and at that time started with the hot flashes, which seemed to dissipate after about six months, but then the nightmare for me started.  I have this weird sensation in my brain and my heart.  The only way I can describe it is I feel kind of flushed, but not warm, and kind of like my heart is going to stop and I am going to drop dead, which of course causes immense anxiety!  Then along the right side of my calf I have this feeling like it is cold, not to the touch, but inside, and it aches, it has moved up to my knee and all around the knee and inner thighh.  This has been two months now.  I can barely drive because of it.  My elbow is burning, I can’t sleep, I am depressed, have headaches, etc.  I went to the doctor and she wanted to give me anti inflammatory and muscle relaxers for the knee, which I forgot to mention feels like it is going to give out on me.  Now the top of my left foot feels the same way at times.  They have run blood work and it is mostly normal, with a few borderline lows.  My blood pressure is generally low but will shoot up high for no reason at all and my heart will start racing.  I think I have peripheral neuropathy or multiple sclerosis or am just plain crazy.  I feel so alone when I get these anxiety attacks and so scared.  My sister is into homeopathy and gave me a mixture of essential oils that I rub on my skin for anxiety and believe it or not it does help.  I just wonder how long this will go on for and if I will ever return to normal???  Does anyone know the answer to this question?"

I diagnosed myself after 6 months and yes blood tests have confirmed I have Epstein Barr .. Mono ... It can reactivate when your hormones drop so lysine is a great immune booster .

I've gotten them before but usually it was before or after a period not during. So I went to a picnic this past Saturday and my period started that morning. It rained the entire time and it was frigidly cold outside. I got sick as a result. I had severe sinus pressure and pain, coughing. This has been going on all week. I went to the doctor yesterday and she gave me a prescription for a saline spray for my nose. My blood pressure was high so she changed my meds. Well today after I took my first dose, I went to sleep and when I got up I noticed my heart was racing. This immediately set off my anxiety. I just talked myself down. Thankfully after a few hours it returned to normal but how scary it was. I haven't had that problem in a long time so it was like new. I have been feeling weird all week. I can't wait for my hormones to finally settle down."

I was on vacation last week, and was expecting that I might experience some additional menopausal symptoms (palpitations, aches and pains etc) mainly because we were in a warm place, and I am not a big fan of hot temperatures. But during the whole week I had a wonderful time though it was really warm and I ate (and drank J) more than usual and did not have even a single episode, other than panting while walking uphill and complaining about the heat. Now back home in my “normal environment”, I am having my usual anxiety symptoms. I have this odd pain/discomfort in sternum (chest bones) and I feel tightness in the neck. Can all this be related to menopause that decide to come and go? I had a complete heart related check-up not too long back where everything was fine. I guess I am just looking for some advise and wondering if any of you had / have similar experiences? Am I just overreacting or should I go for a new check-up? Please help!"

I am 52 years' old and, according to blood tests, am post-menopausal, although it has only been three months since I last spotted.  I woke up in the middle of the night on July 13 and have never been the same since.  Chronic dizziness, heart palpitations, nausea, tingling, numbness, and panic attacks.  Since that time, I have been to the ER (heart is fine), an ENT, a neurologist, two OB/GYNs, primary care physician, psychologist, psychiatrist, and acupuncturist.  (I am seeing a cardiologist later this week.)  I tried 20 mg Prozac for 12 days and had to stop because it made me so sick (no sleeping/eating for two days).  Xanax and Clonozeapam made me more anxious and dizzy.  I had to stop working but need to go back very soon as not working is not an option.  I do not drink or smoke, and I exercise regularly.  I also take vitamins, although I am hesitant to take Relizen or other such menopausal supplements because of potential side effects.  Anyone else experiencing this and how are you coping?

I really dont want to go on HRT but he has made me feel like if i dont its gonna be awful. I said to him so after 10 years if i can be on it and find the right one i then have to come off. Then what? Im feeking bad enough already with all these symptoms and now accrpting the fact my ovaries have defo shut down. Its a strange feeling even though i knew it already. Im confused and now second guessing my decision to go without HRT. After all it doesnt suit everyone.

I'm going on my 4th year of this mess and really can't take anymore. it takes so much of our lives away and I'm wondering if we ever get it back! thank you for listening to my rant and I hope all of you are having a great day! hugs to all?"

Finny2018,2018-09-10T21:28+00:00,"""How the menopause can drive women MAD!""","You just need to google those words above and you will find a great article written in the Daily Mail: Quote from article:  ‘I mentioned to an old friend that what I really needed was a mental institution, because I was losing it. Before long she said: “You don’t need a mental institution, you need a gynaecologist”.   This is such a validating read. I need things like this as well as this forum! Honestly - I really can't comprehend how women did it back in the day - can you imagine all that some of us are going through and having to do it all alone or put your trust into one lousy GP who would give the same nightmare advice that some of us have gotten??? Mauiblue - you mentioned in a post months ago about what it was like to wake up to a horrible night sweat and anxiety - I think I read that at least 5 times. You all know the drill - you think it's getting better - but then the NEW symptom shows up; something you've never experienced before and you look at the meno list and sure enough, it's on there.  I keep saying - ""when is this new symptom NOT going to scare me?"". I clearly had a blessed life before this all hit. My new life is hot flashes, night sweats, unpredictable periods - and all NEW unsettling symptoms. I don't drink. I don't smoke etc. I'm so weary from being scared each time the new symptom comes that sometimes I'm thinking maybe I need a drink.  I'm really starting to understand why they prescribe the anti -anxiety. I keep telling myself - YOU are on your period and you are in PERI and you're clearly right around the meno hallway!  Today I have chapped/chaffed eyelids in the folds from sweating during the hot flashes and night sweats - I guess I didn't think to wipe off my eyelids; I was so focused on the sweat above my lips and patting my face. UGH. My nose is dry and crusty - all new allergy stuff I've never had before.  I do the whole - I'd rather have that symptom than this symptom conversation with myself - when it all just stinks, doesn't it?  It's the unknown all of the time!!!!!!!!"

Does this mean I'm in the later stages now and almost over all this?  Never had any kids, given up hope now. I doubt I'm even ovulating anymore.  Feeling depressed!"

WildwoodMama,2018-09-11T04:13+00:00,Feels Like a Heartattack,"Hello Ladies, A couple of months ago I started having chest tightness/pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath. I've been to the hospital a few times and my blood work, EKG and ECCO all came back normal. Yet my symptoms continue to come and go. This past July, I was driving into town for lunch with my daughter and my hands, arms, neck and face started to burn. Not sweat, just get very hot. I became lightheaded too. At the doctors office, my EKG showed my heart rate was at 130 and I was transferred to hospital where all my symptoms stopped. For the longest time the doctors kept telling me I was having a panic attack, one doctor gave me a large dose of adavent (?) and it did NOTHING. She finally admitted she no longer thought it was panic and tried an anti-inflammatory which seemed to help. I was referred to a cardiologist who has checked everything and I'm ok. Except I still have the chest tightness, pain (only on left side includes arm and neck), shortness of breath, hot face and ears (while the rest of my body is cold) and sooo tired after one of these episodes. The cardiologist is sending me in for a CT scan to see if I have any blockages (which he doesn't think I have), he is trying to reassure me. I've also noticed my vision is a wee bit wonky. Oh, I've just turned 40 (both Mom and Grandma started early/finished early, done well before 45), I still get my period every month but it's now coming two weeks earlier and is super heavy.  My cardiologist did hormone testing and it showed normal so he isn't even willing to consider its menopause, yet my mom says in some ways it sounds similar to her experience. Has anyone else had these symptoms??   And if yes, what helped? Thank you for listening ??"

One in particular is disturbing and makes me think I may have heart or severe esophageal issues.  Or perhaps food allergies or intolerance.  After breakfast this morning I felt sever itching in the center of my chest with burning inside and under my breast and upper stomach.  While the itching is severe my body starts feeling anxious and so not well.  Scared to eat hours later my body feels shaky almost like a sugar crash or something.  Left side heart area has some pain, so not sure if it is hormonal or real heart issues.  Some days I feel perfectly fine, but when my cycles come my body crashes.

But I just feel SO old... and doesn't it get you down? I am active and have been careful with what I eat but the list of symptoms just seem to be getting longer and show no sign of leaving! Here are mine: Weight Gain - Eating less and moving more but still seem to be gaining weight. Trying out intermittent fasting with just staying statically fat! Joint Pain - At night this is worse when sitting down in the evening and ""relaxing"". Legs ache whether elevated, crossed or uncrossed. Getting out of the chair is a creaky affair as is getting up in the morning. My shoulders in the morning are so painful. Once I get going these all improve but do you know what Mrs Menopause, we can't keep moving 24 hours a day! Hair Loss - front of my fringe seems to be disappearing and my parting is really thin showing more scalp as the months go by... Ovarian Cysts - Had two now and they are a delight. Stomach Trouble - Bloating, nausea, constipation or the other. Stomach bloats like a balloon as and when it feels like it. Nausea, Dizziness and Headache - seems to be getting worse especially when the heavy period turns up. Mood - generally a fed up disposition with little tolerance for anything! Hot - that's it, not a flush or a wave just hot. Spots - lovely blind spots that seem to be particularly at home on my chin(s) line. All the above has been checked out by doctors with no real solutions. I take a bucket of supplements and not keen to go down the HRT route. I'm just moaning on here because I know all you of fab forum followers are probably going through exactly the same!"

Laura3333,2018-08-25T12:54+00:00,"Open sores,help, can hardly walk.","Inwas diagnosed with VA around four years ago,I had blood in urine and went for a cystoscopy. My GP put me on oestrogel and I was fine with it then. A couple of years ago I had a rectocele repair, and the burning after that was horrendous, all of perineum, rectal area right to front of urethra, I was told I had pudendal neuralgia caused by prolapse repair So have been treated for that in pain clinic. In the meantime, my vulval area has become very sore and swollen, seems worse when I use oesrogel. Wasn’t sure where the pain actually was coming from, so severe, so came off Nortriptyline, to see what happened. Pain at the moment is inside labia, tried to have a look with specs on and magnifying mirror. Inside labia is very red and swollen, and there are open sores, looks like the skin is breaking down, and is so painful. Sitting has been a problem for years, and now I am struggling. On top of this, the last two nights I have woken up scratching like mad, which hasn’t helped. My gynae said I have fair fragile skin, but that was about a year ago, and he wants me to see a vulval dermatologist. I have an appointment in a couple of weeks. I have tried every cream I can think of to soothe it until then. Any suggestions?

My period is heavy , but not too painful . The thing is you don’t realise just how ill hormones can make you feel . Mine were obviously completely out of whack . I had so many symptoms in that month from when my last period was due to when I finally came on . I had pains in my chest and had convinced myself it was my heart , but was given the all clear ( had an ecg ) , nausea , aches all over , fatigue , insomnia , panic attacks, migraine , reflux , no appetite you name it I had it . To top it all my anxiety and depression were at their peak , but thankfully I’ve come through ! My husband kept telling me it’s only the menopause and that I wasnt dying and I had to keep telling myself that , but when you feel that bad and lousy it’s not easy forgetting about it and laughing it off . Now my husband has man flu and he’s walking around sniffing and coughing and moaning to himself . I really feel like saying it’s only a cold , forget about it . I love him dearly , but if men had to deal with our peri for even a few days , I think maybe they would see things in a different light . After all my husbands cold will go , but I don’t know how long this rollercoaster ride will go on for me ."

I've had night sweats, hot flashes, aches and pains, I've had the worst syptoms of depression and extreme anxiety and probably a bunch more I could name off. Most of the syptoms have calmed down or I've just got used to them (the anxiety still likes to show its evil head here and there) but right now the brain fog and head pressure are my main annoying syptoms. I could certainly say they are better than the depressive state but I need my brain to work. I had to take a less stressful job that required less brain work, but that also involved lowering my income I want to find another job that pays better but I feel Im just dumb or stunned. I don't even know how t9 explain it, it's like when you wake up and your brain is groggy for the first hour...but I'm like that all day, most days, with a few clear days here and there. Are any of you other ladies experiencing this? Have you found anything that truly helps? Or does it go away eventually? Worrying about money is one thing that brings on the anxiety monster."

So we go out to breakfast and decide to see a movie...and 30 minutes later my stomach rumbles and grumbles and I have to RUN into the bathroom. Without giving TMI, while there, I see my period has come back again, (had a 1 day episode last week) and realize that part of the rumblings I was feeling was cramps. Then I have a mini breakdown right there.. and cry. This makes my thoughts turn to why this is happening....is this some dread disease? Will I need an emergency hysterectomy to stop the bleeding? Do I have some awful stomach bug? Does anything like this happen to you ladies? Physically and mentally?? Thanks for reading my rant...any advice is greatly appreciated."

I’ve even had a paramedic out because of it , ecg came back fine . My doctor put me on omeprazole tablets , but some reviews said that it only made things worse once off them , so be cautious before using . Needless to say I haven’t taken them . I thought my period was coming on Saturday as I had the start of bleeding , but now nothing else apart from lower ache . I also had a bad migraine then which I usually get before or with a period . This weekend it will be 8 weeks since my last period . My body feels so lethargic and achy and thoroughly depressed . My husbands getting seriously fed up of my hypochondria , I know . Took my blood pressure earlier and it was 119/85 , so pre hypertension . This has got me worrying as well . He’s told me to stop checking all these things , but my health anxiety keeps thinking heart problems although there was no concern with my doctor or the paramedic . My mind just keeps mulling over things which I know is the worse thing to do . Any advice on the reflux please Xxx"
mary27278,2017-09-16T16:33+00:00,"As soon as I wake in morning I shake, why?","Every morning upon waking I start shaking and heart starts beating like it's going to jump out my chest. My hand is shaking ( if I hold out hand it's basically like this all day) . I visit an endocrinologist yesterday and basically was a waste of time and money. She really wasn't going to do anything until I suggested to check my thyroid. She goes ""oh your skin is so soft but I dont feel any nodules."" Duhh ..i assume so that my skin would be soft from all the weight loss. (Sagging skin) I asked her to do bloodwork she said that it was no need to do bloodwork on my hormones since I already know I'm going through perimenopause. So i said can you do bloodwork on my thyroid? She agreed to check thyroid. She said she thinks it's just anxiety which triggering all the problems. (Stomach issue, weigh loss, etc) then wanted to know if anyone else in my family suffer with anxiety? She basically wrote two prescriptions, one for anxiety and the other for heart palpitations. As usual I leave out with my anxiety prescription. My question is I thought something usually brings on the anxiety? In my case just sitting still brings it or any type of movement. I wake up this way and usually last all day. Is this really anxiety? Though i have periods of really heavy anxiety, it usually come around the same time daily. Mornings, between 12 noon - 3pm. and I get a free hour of lightness, and again between 5pm - 7pm. Afterward, it lightens up. All symptons usually disappear until I go to bed. When they come on really bad during these time..i get so weak, shaky, and such an awful feeling like I just can't go on. This is a constant feeling all day long. One day I was driving by ER and the feeling came on and I drove right to ER. They did bloodwork, ekg, CT scan on pelvis and abdomen, x ray, and pretty much told me that's it's anxiety. Like yesterday, again I walked out with another anxiety prescription. Sorry to rant on, but my question is if it's anxiety, why is it constant and not brought on by something? I think my body is so sensitive to these hormonal changes whereas it's bringing stress to the body?? What's your view or comment? I'm tired of going in circles and wasting my money."

I followed you ladies and spent hours upon hours before officially joining this forum in June and finally had the courage to post and share in this journey with you. I've been having 8 ""better"" days. 8! This feels like a miracle to me.  I started that wild yam cream on August 9. I started for the first 7 days on 10 mg in am and 10mg in pm. I an now on 20mg am and 20mg pm. I do not know if it is placebo or not - but then I'm thinking I will take the placebo, right? I wanted to share this because I've been inspired and encouraged by each of you who have had positive results when you find a supplement, vitamin, bhrt, anti-depressant, etc. I knew I had to try something and I'm starting with this wild yam cream. My friend who was in pharmacy for years was the one who suggested I start with this wild yam cream and also recommended several menopause books that I've been poring over.  Click here to view image"

When I am having a good day I want to do what I have enjoyed my whole life, but I pay for it the next day. For example, yesterday was a great day for me, so I went out and worked in the yard most of the day. We had some storm damage and so my son and I cleaned up, mowed, cut limbs down and the yard looks awesome. I so enjoyed being outside again doing what I enjoy doing. However, today I feel like I'm 90 and been run over b a train! my hips and back hurt, congestion in my chest ( that not getting enough air feeling) off balance feeling, legs aching and arms. I have housework that needs done and no energy to do it! I guess this is more of a rant then anything but I never realized just how much meni takes from us. if we can't enjoy what we like to do then what do we do? I dont suffer from depression or anxiety but this morning I understand why so many women do. We have no choice but to get through it but does it really have to destroy who we were before? Anyway, just some thoughts as I'm having a bad day and completely frustrated by this thing called Menapause. I hope you ladies are having a better day then I am, but I know that this to shall pass. lots of hugs to you all.😌💚💛"

I saw my doctor later that day and he told me to not be concerned . I had suffered the same symptoms previously 3 years ago a few months after losing my mum . All put down to grief and peri anxiety . Now I have read that if you have creases on your earlobes it can mean heart problems . I’ve now noticed these on mine . My anxiety is in overdrive again . Have they missed something ? Am I going to have a heart attack in the near future ? What should I do ? I can’t speak to my husband about this , as he will think I’m a fruit loop and here we go again .

Guest,2018-08-27T14:07+00:00,Thickened uterus,"Hi All, if you might remember I was scheduled for an u/s today to see if the thickened uterus I had back in May has gotten any better. I've been using the progesterone cream all summer. The u/s showed my uterus was normal now. I'm still producing follicles as both my ovaries had one. Everything looked good. So not sure if it was having a different u/s technician, who could actually find my ovaries this time, knew what she was doing, or if the progesterone cream has been helping. I'm inclined to think the cream has helped since I no longer have mid cycle spotting like I used to.  It's a good day, and I'm relieved that I didn't jump right away and get the biopsy in May like they wanted me to. The tech said that a thickened uterus is indeed common in perimeno. No need to panic right away. That said, if you have been in menopause for a number of years and start to have spotting, this should be investigated further with an u/s and biopsy if needed. But us peri gals, take a deep breath! XO"

I was doing so well with the symptoms disappearing and now BAM , in the past six weeks since I haven’t had a period they’ve all been creeping back . Feel horrible this morning and just want to cry . Can’t talk to my husband and daughter , as they’re probably fed up hearing about it . Seem to be getting like mini hot flushes as well . Please help"

Since then I’ve been taken off the iron tabs as my bloods now say iron has gone up and is normal.  My hair is majorly falling out now. I used to have really thick long hair. Now it’s very thin and limp, I’m terrified I’m going bald!!! What, if anything, can I take to make my hair grow back? I’m worried about taking iron as mine is normal now and I know you can overdose on iron.  Thanks x"

pat48401,2018-08-26T06:30+00:00,I desperately need your advice. Could it be menopouse?,"I am post menopause now. 3 months ago after 2.5 years of no period and lots of drama with peri like severe anxiety and burping and panic attack, I became period again. Yes i was bleeding. Went to gynocologist and he took me to day surgery to take sample. Could not find any abnormality and took my IUD out. I was sure it was a period all the symptoms was like a period. After that my anxiety started again. Last month i got sinus infection doctor gave me antibiotic after finishing anribiotic i start to get Panic attack pretty much all day and night. How can i describe it. It likes somebody squeezing my head and body between concretes and after 15 minutes leave my exhausted body in the street. Burping like nervous burp. But feeling doom and gloom does not leave me alone. I walk and go swim everyday helps for couple of hours but when i eat my meal for example my panic attack comes back and shakes me in head and body and send this electectric shocks to my head, face and body with dizziness in morning. When to Gp last week and gave me anti axiety Serepox. I can not take it during the day because i need to drive and get of the house. In night i am not sure help me or not. I have all sort of nasty thought to end everything. My husband is away for work but will be back in couple of day. Ican not tell my son how do i feel because it is his last year of high school and he is very busy with exam. Please advice me."

I also got my period during that time and ate seafood a few times as I was on vacation but don’t think either of those things have anything to do with it.

I get some kind of electric shock could be anywhere in my body that signals a hot flush is coming, then my whole body temperature rises, my forehead, under my breast, under my tummy, between my legs all red hot and wet through could last up to 20 minutes, at the same time I may have intrusive dark thoughts, pounding heart, I feel weak like I’m going to faint, I feel like any second I will fall to the floor and black out, my muscles ache everywhere, I feel so weak,  I’ve been having hot flushes for a long time, I’ve been on and off HRT, I usually get sore breasts and low mood with HRT so I stop taking them.  I’ve niw been off HRT for 4 months and I’m thinking of going back to doctors and going back on it, trying a different one, my flushes are awful and affect my quality of life.  In the mornings I wake up with my body so sore everywhere I tell myself, that one day it won’t matter because I will be dead. My thoughts can be so low in the morning. I’ve made a doctors apt to discuss HRT because I can’t cope without them, hot flushes can affect us all differently but they are equally disturbing and affect quality of life."

At xmas this escalated to panic disorder, looping panic attacks. I am now on 75 mg sertraline (AD), betablockers, diazepam when needed and evirel conti HRT patches. Palpitations coming more frequent...wondering if its the HRT patches. Dont drink, smoke or have caffein. Went back to work too early today...got oalps when i got home & intense fear. Ecg at xmas showed normal tho doc said something minor with atria...she didnt understand! She at first said it was afib then later said its not. This question mark is troubling me wen i get the palps...i asked her if she thinks theyre stress related, she shrugged n said maybe! Think i need echocardiogram to put my mind at rest.

I have missed a trip to Europe spent $1000’s on healthcare ... tried everything . When on when does this ease up?

Then it times I felt like I could feel air bubbles inside. I’ve had it she feelings. I’ve had burning feelings. I’m currently dealing with intense noticeable it she discomfort. I’ve also had differing levels of pelvic pain. I went to my gynecologist and went through all kinds of testing. All of the STI testing came back negative. I had two different wet mount test both of which came back negative. I’ve had a vaginal ultrasound as well as a CT scan. The only thing that was found were a couple cyst on my left ovary. I realize that could account for some of my pelvic pain. I have tried to explain as best I can to my gynecologist. He currently put me on a vaginal gel for BV. This makes me uncomfortable because it is a strong anabiotic and I do not believe I have BV. I have no discharge. I have no odor. In fact throughout all of this I would say that I have been very dry in the vaginal area. I am 46. I’ve started to have irregular periods. I am assuming I am perimenopausal. I have Peri menopausal symptoms as well. Could this be a hormone issue?  My anxiety is high. My stress is high. I feel like I’m going crazy.

I turned 51 a couple of weeks ago , so worried about getting old . Last week I had pains in my chest and ended getting a paramedic round . Came to the conclusion it was a mixture of heartburn , anxiety and maybe I’d pulled it as my shoulder blades were aching as well . This in turn hasn’t helped my mood as you question your mortality . I just want to feel better and gave my mind at ease instead of constantly worrying about something . In the end you wonder if the symptoms are real or partly psychosymatic . Will I feel better if my period comes ? I spoke to my doctor as well last week and he was very reassuring , I always have it in the back of my mind if they’ve missed something . On Sunday the roast I cooked was a bit of a disaster and what could go wrong did go wrong . It was like the end of the world to me .

Before I started my estrogen was 8, progesterone was .1, testosterone total was 15, and testosterone free was 1.5. All very low. Here I am at 2.5 weeks with lots of questions. 1.

What are your estrogen and testosterone levels running now? If you state your levels please state your pellet dosage.  I am seeing some improvement at 2.5 weeks such as better sleep, less hungry, libido better. My main problems are still EXHAUSTION! I feel so tired and out of it.

susane84679,2018-08-26T14:30+00:00,Are we really being fair?,"Good Morning Ladies, I wanted to say something about Husband bashing of I may?. I know we are all going through something pretty horrific and we dont know ourselves anymore, we are confused and scared most of the time. We dont understand what is happening to us on any given day. With that being said, if we dont understand how can we expect our significant other to understand? We can try and explain but if it doesn't make sense to us, it will not make sense to them. They live with a person that used to be their wife and dont know what happened to her. When I hear someone say my husband doesn't get it, I think to myself no, he doesn't because we dont talk to him about how we are feeling. We as women were not made that way I think. For those who are trying to understand, I say Bless you and for those who do not want to understand and tell us that it is all in our head? i think they are as scared and confused as we are and that's how they cope. It doesn't make them bad , they just need to research. There are spouses (like mine) that are going through this with us as a team. I can not imagine my husband not supporting me and being emotionally unavailable to me because he doesn't understand. So ladies, the next time you feel the need to lash out at your spouse because he is not acting the way you think he should, please stop and think about it for a minute. I think if we try and communicate our feelings better and ask him to research what menapause does to us. Maybe then more of our spouses will understand. These are just my thoughts and in no way directed at anyone. I dont know each person's situation and everyone is different, but I do believe that we need to communicate more with them. I hope all of you have a symptom free day, Hugs to all!?🙂"

I just thought I would mention it on here in case other women were wondering the same and had also had a laparoscopy, something to mention to doctors who dismiss symptoms due to being too young."

That’s fine, but since than I feel horrible. I have read here about similar symptoms, and they are so nasty. Depression, health anxiety, brain zaps and whooshes, mental laziness, doom and gloom, feeling like dying. Since May I travelled three times abroad for business, and I had loved that before, but now I felt exhausted, stupid, lazy, anxious, no more interest in anything, acting like a robot. I know this is just this stage of life, but please, will it pass? I have been always active, with lots of hobbies, and I looked forward the end of periods because I suffered with pains all my life, but now I feel drained, lazy, lost."

She used to get insomnia quite often but now it's pretty much been replaced with incessant exhaustion - sensitivity to noise, light and smell - Hot flushes still happening but less sweating, and just more SICK SICK SICK - Sudden angry outbursts then weeping not long after.  Mood swings pretty horrendous but not like a couple months ago when I'm sure she was much more estrogen dominant - Generally SICK AND TIRED OF FEELING SICK AND TIRED I've noticed that she seems to have had a turn in symptoms, which coincided with stopping biodentical progesterone cream (approach with caution, BTW) and starting to take a DIIM supplement.  She is less ""elevated and whippy"" (but still is occasionally) and is more fatigued and nauseous.   She is ravenous often but terrified to eat.   I have researched this for years and she is on every supplement known to womenkind (apart from any natural estrogen replacement or hot flush remedies).  I keep a daily diary.  I'm hoping someone will recognise this change and tell me that it's a sign things are coming to an end in the ovary sector..........but please don't say it just to be kind - be brutally honest!!

I haven't had a good nights sleep since I started.  Lately, I only manage to get 2-4hours sleep every night and I wake up every half hour or hour.  My muscles and joints ache and I have stiffness in my fingers which is very painful.  Recently, the leg twitches or fast jolts have also been disturbing my sleep.  I seem to be experiencing a throbbing sensation in my arms, legs, back or shoulders. The best way to describe this sensation is that it feels like a heart beating in my limbs or back.  Is anyone else experiencing this throbbing sensation?  I'm using magnesium but I haven't noticed any change.   My dr won't prescribe sleep meds and seems to think that my symptoms are anxiety related but I remain unconvinced.  I'm terrified that I have some auto-immune disease because of the twitching/jolts and weird throbbing in my limbs and upper body.  Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you ladies."

Do you think this is anxiety ? I’ve started listening to meditation every evening but it’s not helped me sleep. I’m so exhausted and weak and feel I walk sideways.

It haunted me most of my life. Suffered with depression and had many counselling sessions and kind of coped ok for a while. I was OK for a while. Now going through perimenapause it started to HIT ME HARD AGAIN.  I feel no one cares. My husband says he understands and cares but do not show it in the way I like it. I have a 9 year old daughter.  She sometimes feels responsible for me. I get very upset.  She is very young and she shouldn't be in that position.  Then I blame my husband for not showing enough care for me to take the burden off our lovely daughter.  I watch my daughter and husband play happily and admire them. Then I feel jelous that I am not part of their fun together since I am miserable with peri .. I feel guilty, guilty. useless and unloved.  I cried and said to both my daughter and husband today that 'I am a piece of nothing just a lump"" My so loving husband kept quiet but 9 year old girl comforted me in her own ways... please TALK to me some sense to save my daughter and me.

Finny2018,2018-08-25T14:06+00:00,"Doom & Gloom, Nausea, Adrenaline, Chest weirdness; ...it's my HOT FLASH!","You can be having a great time and then as Juanita said in a previous post - you start having these horrible thoughts come from nowhere - for me I've finally figured it out;  it's a Hot Flash! With or Without Sweating - it's a Hot Flash! For those who've been on the forum for a while - you probably already know this, LOL! I'm the new girl on the block. Yet I read all of these posts that describe these experiences of jelly legs, suffocating feeling in chest, can't breathe, dizzy spells, nausea etc. I went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack in April - the female doctor said it's vasomotor symptoms (aka Menopause Hot Flash). And yet - even when this happens I still think - should I go to the ER again?  I think some of the ""experts"", LOL, like to call them a panic attack because it has a lot of the same symptoms. And yet all of the Meno ""experts"" call them Hot Flashes.  Sometimes I consider posting my symptoms that come on before a hot flash. My symptoms can be different with every single hot flash! I had no idea it was a hot flash but I'm starting to figure this out after nearly 3 months of it. If you are having a lot of the other peri or menopause symptoms - then, like ME, at age 49 and for the first time; this is all new and it was all very unsettling/scary!  My recovery time: Because my hot flashes feel like a fight or flight feeling that comes from out of nowhere - it can take me SO long to recover from the experience. And this makes sense to me. If any of you have been in an intense/scary situation with adrenaline; you know what that feels like and can remember it ... - it can WIPE YOU OUT both emotionally and physically! Not all of the time - but when I have an intense one I am so drained.  It is hard to get used to these hot flashes. When I start to have one I want to go and hide! I started a natural progesterone cream and I'm hoping this will give me marked improvement in the coming months.  Would love to hear how you all cope when you are having these ""moments"". At times I've thought of just saying out loud - excuse me - I'm having a Hot Flash. What do you all do? Find a bathroom? Hide out?"

So...last night I got one of those headaches that usually happen before your period- that is, when you actually have one. It is one sided and involves my cheekbone and nose,clogs my nostril. Then it radiates to my forehead. Sometimes it's like a knife to my temple. It starts and stops. It sets my health anxiety into high gear. I know I have a tendancy to think the worst, although I try to talk myself down. They say 99% of what we worry about never happens. Over this year I've had these symptoms: dizziness, tummy troubles, nausea, headaches, absolutely messed up sleep, itchy skin, creepy crawly sensations, knee pain, ankle pain, the tremors, super dry eyes, heel pain, thickening toenails but thinning finger nails, my eyebrows migrated to my top lip,cramps, a period for a month, a rash from wearing pads for that month....on, and on, and etc. They rotate. 2 days ago my doc said I was healthy and we would deal with the extended peri. She suggested cryoablation. I just had hysteroscopy and got a normal biopsy from that. So I am very grateful. Dont want to to tempt fate. I'm laughing and crying because I'm scared and fed up. Praying this is sinusitis and it goes away. Maybe hormonal AND sinuses... I just heard that this is a bad allergy season here in Chicago....ragweed n pollen count super high.

I’ve been suffering badly for over a year.  41 and too young for this s**t!  This next appointment, I am not taking no, or deal with the symptoms for an aswer! So, I am on an AD (ssri) for peri anxiety.  To “boost my serotonin” as my primary dr put it.  I know it is my hormones going haywire, but, needed to do something to get me by until I see my new gyno.   I just learned that an AD’s job is to redistribute serotonin in our brains not produce it.  Estrogen produces serotonin in a woman.  Therefore, if you are estrogen deficient an AD is not going to be optimally effective.  Eureeka! Do you ladies know anything about this?  I think inevitably I will ask about going back on a higher dose BCP and stay on the AD."

As my mom said this is my premenopause journey as she went through the same thing but had a hysterectomy. Put on progesterone (daily mini pill) as I didn't want an IUD or ablasion. March - gastro issues started with acid reflux June - sternum pain thought I was having a heart attack. Have searing pain under breasts. (Chest xray normal, blood work normal) June/July - tingling in hands and feet, sore calf, numbness in mouth, aches moving throughout body (blood work normal, ultrasound ordered) Well yesterday I get a call from my doctor that I have an irregular vascular mass between the uterus and the ovary 2X1 cm surrounded by free fluid. MRI suggested.  This has send me into a tail spin of panic and anxiety.  I do have a history of endometriosis (Stage IV) and had a laproscopy for it 14 years ago.

I feel nothing, no part of my body has any sexual sensation any more. It feels mechanical. I don't get orgasms, if I ever do (so rarely I have forgotten the last time) it lasts less than a second. I don't feel satisfied. I feel so depressed about it. I work out, I'm slim, I eat healthy, I take supplements and vitamins. Also I've tried HRT, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone combo. But NOTHING is working. It freaks me out that one must live the next two or three decades without feeling anything! Desperate for help. Does anyone have similar problems? How do you cope?"
sharcerv52408,2018-08-21T21:03+00:00,Terrible Migraines,"Hello Ladies, Do any of you get these migraines during your cycle? I have had them in the past surrounding my periods but this time it seems to be lingering and my period has ended. I don't know if it is cycle related this time or if it is this new blood pressure medication that my doctor prescribed. I was taking valsartan but the pharmacy called and said that they had to stop issuing it because there were some impurities in the lot that was issued in July by the manufacturer. So my doctor switched me to carvedilol. I started having these migraines about a week after I began the new medication. I was also on my period at the same time so it's hard to tell which is the culprit, my period or the medication. I told my doctor about this but she said headaches are not a common side effect of this medication. Of you ladies who experience migraines, what solutions have come up with that seem to really be effective?"

Because seriously how in the world are we suppose to feel all these horrible day after day week after week month after month awful symptoms and just go about our daily lives!!! Im dizzy numb can't breathe indigestion after even drinking water, hot cold crying sad don't want to go anywhere I'm never happy nothing at all makes me laugh or smile, I'm just sad and lonely and scared all the time... Last night I couldn't sleep at all I was up with pains in chest area which I think is all just acid reflux ate my dinner late (NOT GOOD) but if I would have skipped a meal I would have had low blood sugar symptoms so instead ate late and belched all night sipped water had to use bathroom, what a vicious cycle all of it.. And why are the mornings the worst with doom and gloom crying emotionally bad? I have no stamina I'm drained tired fatigue, and feel like this is such a bad time personally professionally physically and mentally... I never knew this could all be so bad, and I want so bad to wake up from this nightmare.. I really feel like GOD must be mad at me or something to have to go thru all of this.. And all the ladies I've ever talked to always just say tough times at this time in life it will get better in time and you'll be stronger for it!! I'm so waiting for that day!! I also can't watch any bad news hear bad news from people its just so physically draining all of it!!! Sorry for the rant just really bad night and morning!!!!!"

Finny2018,2018-08-21T16:08+00:00,Saw my 60 yo Doctor...she is on HRT and an AD. When did you all make that decision????,"I have such mixed emotions about my appointment. I have some comfort after talking with her; a very strong woman with a thriving practice.  My doctor is 60 years old and was very open and honest with me about her Peri and current Meno experience; for that, I am so very thankful.  She humbly said she could not continue her practice had she not got on the HRT and then an AD. Like me, her Mom had a breeze of Meno.  She said she started the HRT 10 years ago at 50 and then introduced Prozac.  Of course after spending almost an hour with her, there was a comfort knowing my struggle is a very REAL thing and that I am not alone. But at the same time, it was the realization, once again, that this could be my new normal and I may have to try HRT or AD or both.  It's a roller coaster!!!!! I have a few good days and then I think - maybe I can make it without introducing something? Maybe the worst is over???? Maybe I can tough this out? Then a stupid new symptom will show up - like heartburn/relfux. Then that will go away and then I will have a back ache for a few days. Then that goes away and then my left foot will tingle for 3 days. Then that goes away ETC ETC ETC. Then my mood will be good for 2 days and then a really sad day. I didn't have ANY Of this until age 49 when my periods started getting crazy and my progesterone dropped.  Did some of you reach a breaking point? Did you say - I will give myself x amount of time and if this isn't any better I am willing to try something??? 2 months? 3 months? It is SO hard to know what to do."

I woke up about a month ago with constant feelings of what I would call adrenaline rushes. Coolness starting in chest and rushing down arms. I would then get major anxiety and nausea...actually ended up in ER and they sent me home saying it was anxiety. Since then, the rushes have subsided quite a bit, but now I am left with good days and then days of major anxiety. its almost debilitating. I also experience sleep disturbances. I am almost asleep, but then jerk awake before I actually fall sleep. My progesterone level came back .6 and estrogen was 44. Started 200 mg of progesterone and noticed some relief with the sleep. The anxiety comes in waves...some days are completely normal, and then some days I have so much anxiety that its unbearable. does this sound like perimenopuase/menopause to any of you??? I cant live this way if it is. I started looking into Adrenal Fatigue syndrome as I had the symptoms for that too. any advise is soooo greatly appreciated!!!!! HElp!"

I don't know if it was the change in cream or just the old symptoms rearing their ugly head again. I'm so achy today too and burning feet again. Just awful. I ordered the old cream and won't use the new one anymore just in case. I do see where so many people have bad reactions to progesterone cream, maybe it's what else is in the it?

My brain fog is so dense I can get work done only about an hour every other day or so.  I have an anal fissure.  A pain you would not wish on a war criminal. My best friend, who is like a sister, is in S. Africa for a year.  (I am not married and don't deal with my abusive family of origin.) So my social support feels decimated. My job is so stressful I am losing sleep, grinding my teeth, and eating junk. (Getting a period every other week doesn't help with that either. I feel so alone that at times I am crushed by it. I am sick of all the responsibilities that all fall on me. I am in such a state of overwhelm, I can't even unload the dishwasher. And I am so angry all the time I feel like I am sandpaper in human form, if that makes sense.  My regular coping strategies, journaling, exercise, reading, aren't relieving the pressure.

theresa53424,2018-08-16T16:56+00:00,"Menopause, please go away, its been 8 years now, I want my life back.","I'm 52 and had a hysterectomy in 2013, the doctor left my ovaries intact, he said by removing them it could throw me into full blown menopause. With that being said I've been suffering since 2010; the last 3 years has been torture. This last year, the absolute worse. I wake up every morning with the 66++++ symptoms. My blood work always comes back normal. Going through menopause is debilitating. I don't sleep, severe night sweats, severe hot flashes, which will then send me to the bathroom where I have diarrhea every morning for an hour or so. I work two jobs and I'm exhausted 24-7, therefore, on the weekends I try to rest hoping by Monday I will feel rejuvenated, but it never happens. I often call out sick, go home sick, go home with my office clothes soaked due to excessive sweating. I often make up stupid excuses with work because menopause is something that a lot of women don't discuss. I suffer most with physical side affects and anxiety followed by panic attacks. To live like this daily is true torture. I try to stay positive but its not easy, especially when your in pain. My joints hurt daily, my back is killing by 3:00pm, headaches, migraines, nausea, sleep deprived, chest pain, dizziness, heart beating fast, in the bathroom 24-7, and completely wiped out. I'm ready for bed by 7:30, and/or will make myself go to bed early knowing when 2:00am comes around, I'll be awaken with hot flashes/night sweats and then running to the bathroom; followed by anxiety and panic attacks. Then I begin to pray, please god, let me see the light at the end of the tunnel. Sad to say, and I would never hurt myself because I truly love life but I moments when I start thinking, I'd rather die then to go through this daily. I refuse to have hormone treatment, and do my best with home remedies. Its rare that I have a good day, I find myself begging in head, ""please, just let me get through this before menopause ruins my life completely."" My life is literally on hold until I get through this. Menopause is a daily feeling of constant fear too, because you really do feel like you're slowly dying, well I do anyway. I hope the worse is soon coming to a end. More women need to start talking about this and I think it should be discussed in the work place, doctors and therapists should be highly educated when it comes to menopause. I've seen women diagnosed for mental conditions and then be prescribed multiple medications they don't need, the list can go on and on. I recently had a therapist say thank you to me for sharing my story.

About 8 or 9, maybe even 10 months ago I had very slight spotting and before that had not had a real period in about a year.  Any time there was anything, it was just spotting.  So I wake up yesterday and again slight spotting.  But I feel crampy like I used to when I would get my period.  (I am 55 btw, and I did think I was in menopause).  So, do I now have to start all over counting months to be period free for a year??"

kuppy1234,2018-08-08T19:04+00:00,Perimenopause - hysterectomy help!,"Hi ladies. I am 33 and have dealt with anxiety and some OCD since giving birth to my daughter. It had progressed so bad that i went to the doc and they put me on Lexapro. Needless to say after 7 years of that, it made me WAY WORSE and my husband left and I was violent, so I came off of them after weening down for 2 years. So. I had it under control for the longest time. I would still have some intrusive obsessive thoughts, but it was manageable. My mom, who was my rock and my ""person"", passed away a year ago and i was doing good until June. We went on vacation and when i came home, i was a completely different person. I was extremely weepy, nauseas upon waking, hopeless, depressed, feelings that i wanted to just die, and my periods were wonky and heavy and then short and then my sex drive PLUMMETED, which is NOT ME. I joke that i am a 14 year old boy going through puberty, its that high. Now, i'm just disinterested. And this just in, sex.... hurts. Hurts?! Like, what happened? I am usually very outgoing and need to stay busy (anxiety) but here lately simple tasks feel overwhelming. I was sitting at work and then all of a sudden i felt like I could scream, and then the fear of losing control and hurting myself popped in my brain, which caused me to panic, and i about lost my case. I had to go into the bathroom and cry just to relieve some of the pent up feelings. It was terrifying.  Please tell me i'm normal! I've had intense panels of auto-immune diseases checked and all negative. I went for an ultrasound and i have a cyst on both ovaries and some polyp on my enodmetrium. I am having a DNC and a biopsy on that soon. I just want it all out. I want to have a hysterectomy, but i fear that will wreak havoc on my mental health. Others say they would do a hyster all over again. I honestly think i'm just SUPER sensitive to hormones. Birth control almost sent me to a looney bin, and i tried 5 diff kinds. So, I think that maybe I just DON'T NEED HORMONES. LOL I have tried a homeopathic doctor, i've tried birth control, i've tried diet, exercise, i eat better than anyone i know, i don't eat sugar, hardly any dairy, no gluten, i drink only water or carbonated water.

Do you think something like this (imagine an ice cube on your wrist) could help in a hot flash? And if so, how would you like it to be marketed to you in a respectful, non-stigmatizing way?  2.

Had some tradgedy happen in my life, and it’s been a little tough but pulling through it. My boyfriend ended his life in June, a shock to so many of us. Anyways- symptom wise I’ve been doing pretty well, even through all of that. UNTIL today :-(  I was walking into Walmart and BAM out of nowhere- dizzy and wobbly.  Bad enough I walked back to my car and went home, laid down and took a nap for about an hour and a half. Got up and felt a little better but still “off balance”. We’re in the middle of renovations on our home from hurricane Irma, and staying at my moms house. My son and I just drove up to our house to check on some things, and I’m still wobbly but then also now have a weird “headache”? Not painful, more like pressure, and now and then a random “clicking” behind my right ear/back-right of my head.  Anyone ever had these symptoms?  I’m thinking a migraine coming on maybe? The pressure is on the right side and almost at times feels like a “pulling” feeling to my sinus cavity or something. Idk it’s just strange as heck. And we all know this health anxiety will make us absolutely BONKERS if we don’t talk to each other.  Oh- and today is day three of my period in FULL SWING.  Any support and comparing is greatly appreciated."

Moonracoon,2018-08-15T12:03+00:00,Could it be menopause?,I’m 47 and for the last 10 years have had sudden horrible nausea  on occasions (most often in the middle of the night). The doctor put it down to IBS but it never seems to fit other’s experiences of IBS. It seems to happen mid cycle and a few days before my period. In the last week I have also been feeling really hot and sweaty (more than the weather would account for). I’m not getting the sudden ‘flush’ feeling that people talk about with menopause. I have a Mirena coil so periods are a bit hit and miss but I definitely still notice a cycle even if I don’t bleed. Does anyone else have similar feelings?

Have the usual suspects of symptoms, hot flashes, insomnia, irritability, anxiety, moody, palpitations... I still get my migraine monthly like i would when i had my period. Obgyn says ovaries are still trying to produce eggs and hormones still fluctuating. Over the last year I have had a new symptom come on ear/neck soreness/pain and not sure if its allergies which i never had till this last year (i know alot of people that normally dont are suffering) i have also heard that meno can make allergies bad? or maybe these symptoms are hormone related. I have had my ears checked and they are all good but have been having alot pain soreness on sides of neck and up around to back of ears and soreness inside ears feels like pressure. Its very frustrating not to know why this is happening. If its meno then so be it. I have an appt in two weeks with an integrative holistic practice to see if some of these issues can be sorted out. Its very frustrating because this issue in particular brings me alot of anxiety which just creates a vicious cycle. I just dont feel like myself anymore I feel like all i do is worry or sweat or stress...ughhhhhhhh"

I know I have found so much support and peace of mind when reading others have my same issues and have truly made it through some rough patches because of the info on this board. I have also loved finding the posts where women share a positive story and experience. Today, I have one to share! Last August, me and my family were set to go to Hawaii for a family vacation. Long story short... we had to cancel it because of my severe and debilitating peri symptoms. I was very deep in the weeds last July/August/September. Literally bedbound and the housebound during those months and only left my house to go to the Dr.'s to try and figure out what the hell was wrong with me! It's been 13 months of peri for me. I am now 11 months without a period and am feeling better. Well enough to go on the family vacation we missed because peri had eaten me alive last summer! I know we are all different and have a different hormonal journey, but I hope this post gives some hope that this phase of our lives is not permanent and we will all get better. Last summer I was so lost and sick and terrified I would never feel good or be myself again! I am not 100% myself yet, but I am getting there and so grateful we get to go on this vacation and create some family memories. I truly didn't know if I would ever feel good enough for me to be able to enjoy things again. Hang in there and know this crappy phase will end and we will all be able to enjoy life once more.

Granted, my depression starting getting worse when I started the menopause, so I think it's fair to say that it has some bearing.

I'm 46 and have been in peri for about 5 years but no major effects just the odd missed period, heavy period and the discovery of a fibroid. I had some tests done last Dec that confirmed in am in peri and had my last period at the beginning of June this year so this is the first time I have missed 2 periods. About 5 weeks ago I suddenly got hit with a wave of new symptoms such as nausea, sometimes off my food but other times I'm fine, tiredness and fatigue, anxiety and acid reflux and all of the common things that are discussed on here. I've stayed away from coffee and alcohol for last 5 weeks and have been taking taking Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12 and Milk Thistle for the last week and thankfully the nausea has stopped and the tiredness has improved. I went to speak to the nurse on Monday and she tested me to make sure I'm not pregnant and told me off as my urine was very dark. I told her that I thought I had been not drinking enough, in fact at the time of my appointment it was 12pm and I hadn't had anything to drink all day and she said I was dehydrated. She arranged for me to have a full blood count, vitamin D check and also full iron profile as well as my FSH and LH blood tests. I've had the full blood count, Vitamin D and iron profile and all has come back clear however I have noticed that for last few days the whites of my eyes are off colour and very slightly jaundiced. I am now in full blown panic mode !! Would a problem with my liver have shown up in my full blood count? Have I harmed myself by becoming deydrated? Is it perimenopause related or is it something more sinister?? I have arranged an appointment with the doctor for Monday morning to discuss but I am having a real meltdown.

My main problem other than vaginal dryness/atrophy is zero sex drive. My husband and I frequently argue & fight over this. I have not used any hormone replacement. I can't be the only one with this problem, how have you dealt with this? Does BHRT work? What about testosterone supplements? Please help, I need my mojo back lol!"
lori93950,2018-08-12T19:50+00:00,No zest for life .... nothing excites me.,I wondered if anybody else feels this way? I used to get excited if the bloody gardener was coming ! Now I don’t even care about the garden.  I used to order clothes online all the time didn’t keep most of them but I’d get a little buzz about it . Now I couldn’t give a s***.  I’d get excited about my workout now have to push myself to do it... I mean really push .we have a big car event next week in my town I’ve got friends who come to it and it’s loads of fun ... fancy cars fancy events .. not even excited about that ! Normally I’d be picking outfits out getting a spray tan ... What is this all about .
mauiblue,2018-08-10T03:46+00:00,An Inside Job,"Over the course of 16 months (which has been my sentence so far) ive learned that this Per/Meno condition or whatever you want to call it..isnt a quick fix. I feel as though i have reached the crossroad of my life, and this is natures way of showing me that i need to go inward. ya i know it all sounds flaky but its the truth. Im forced to look at myself, past present future, and come to terms with everything. I know that there are a lot of unresolved things that have taken place long ago, things i didnt even understand or process that could have had an impact on my psyche to this date. So for me to continue in a healthy manner I need to do the work on the inside. This might also explain how many women dont feel the pain of menopause because they are in a good place in their minds and hearts. Also it shows as many women have very hard illnesses and fates, and yet accept them with all of the grace in the world, through the pain through everything. They are not affected by it. So for me..i think this is an inside job.. and maybe if i can figure some things out about myself, i will be more accepting of what is happening to me now. I dont know if it will pull me out of depression, but I do know that our minds are ever powerful, even more powerful than the hormones, and the two are at battle at the moment. didnt mean to go on the hippie track but i think this has something to do with it all.. x0x0x0x"

I keep telling myself that this isn't a life sentence, and it has to end some time, but it is becoming increasingly difficult to bear and to continue to find the hope to go on. I still have times when I feel completely well, or almost well, and I relish them, but then I plummet into the most painful abyss, and I just can't seem to find my way out, when I am there. I am starting to trial different medications, such as mood stabilizers, with my psychiatrist's guidance, as walking this road unmedicated feels unbearable at times. When I am balanced, everything seems in perspective, but then I just fall off of the deep end, and I feel so cheated and robbed of my happiness. I am a super strong person, and I have done everything that I know how to do to get better, but overriding hormone fluctuations seems a near impossibility. Please tell me that things will get better with time."

Currently I'm using utrogestran tabs, 2 at night... and it's just awful. I've tried other progesterones in Evorel and Femseven patches but they had adverse affects too...  I'm currently using Evorel oestrogen patches and they've helping but just want to find a progesterone that suits me.  I feel as if I'm losing the plot and really want to cry but have got two children to look after so desperately need to hold it together...

Also I've noticed lower back pain that comes and goes and more recently what I can only describe as arthritic hands where I can't grip/grab things properly and soooo stiff generally when first get out of bed, but only noticed this when started hrt.

Finny2018,2018-08-05T21:25+00:00,Perimenopause VS. Menopause…why would this ever get any better????????,"So I’ve read many of the books. I’ve lived on the forums. I’ve read hundreds and hundreds of reviews on Amazon. If all of the symptoms we “Peri’s” are having are to do the levels of hormones fluctuating/dropping….then once they are done doing their little nightmare on our body during the Peri – what happens at Menopause?? If I get the menses all over the board on the calendar, hot flashes, body aches, fatigue, dry skin, mood swings, lethargy, depression, anxiety now for the first time at 49 years in Perimenopause – WHY is this going to stop at Menopause or SOMEDAY just because I’m done with my cycle? What changes at the SOMEDAY? My body decides it’s gotten used to it? It levels off? I read conflicting data over and over about that question. Once you are in Menopause, some say you will always have to do hormones – others say you will always have to be taking something for the symptom that you are struggling with most. Oprah lasted all of 2 years in Peri feeling awful and finally did the BHRT. I’ve been on the Peri Roller Coaster for about 3 years. I could handle most of the symptoms I was having until I experienced the depression, anxiety, and lethargy for the very first time in my life during my May 2018 cycle – I can’t do that one again!  I’ve reached out to about 20 friends/family – about 9 went on anti-depressants, 9 went on BHRT and 2 toughed it out. I guess I’m at the tough out stage but really leaning towards some BHRT.  You all inspire me SO much! Your perseverance gives me SO much strength. I am so thankful for this forum! Just wondering if this “toughing it out” is any way of living? Like many of you have shared...I feel like I can't make any big plans as it seems I never know what I am going to feel like each week. Thanks for letting me vent."

I can only remind myself that its hormones and not be going nuts. But is it?? I am perplexed and wish that i knew more,even though ive researched to no end.  If all labs blood as well as saliva have shown basically that i have little or no hormones at all..then why do I feel so overwhelmingly hormonal? Is it the way I perceive it? Or is it all lack of the right neurotransmitters e.g. serotonin, dopamine, gaba etc. which causes the low mood. Or is it that im in adrenal overdrive which is causing the dreadful symptoms. I really dont know, and so far nor does any of the docs out there that ive consulted with. (several) Im afraid i will be continuing to fight the good fight.. what else is there?   hugs to you all Click here to view image"

My mother went through full menopause at 43.   Anyway I started to get nerve pain in my legs in December (out of no were). It actually started as itching on the bottom of my feet (again came out of no were). It then moved up my shins and I have itching throughout and sometimes I feel like I have bee stings throughout my body.  I have had an mri from a neurologist and discovered I have some mild disc degenerative issues that “may cause” this in my lumbar and cervical area.   I have also been cleared of lymes, ms, lupus and so on.  I’m on maloxicam (prescription anti inflammatory) and I thinks it’s helped some but in my heart of hearts I feel like perimenopause could be the cause!?!? I should also mention I have itchy skin, some hair thinning, and night sweats especially right before my period.   I’m starting progesterone cream this month.    Hellllp the nerve pain isn’t awful every day but it’s definitly limiting my daily activity’s when it’s present."

Musicgeekgrl,2018-07-30T18:26+00:00,It's About Year 5 For Me and I'm Sicker Than Ever,"After getting my period at 12 and having it for nearly 40 years (I am 51), my last one was about a year and a half ago. Since then I've only spotted from super light pink to brown and only about every three months for one day at the most. At 43, I was sterilized by my choice, having had no children. In the prior two to three years I had heavy and frequent periods and then virtually none at all; light hot flashes, weight loss of 20+ lbs in the last year, and a bit of drying of the vagina. But for the past two months I've had what felt like flu. I was actually diagnosed with walking pneumonia, had multiple tests, came out clear just a few weeks ago, and yet the following symptoms remain: head fullness, watery or sticky ears that pop, swollen sinuses, tonsillitis-like symptoms, shortness of breath, wheezing, panic attacks, constant anxiety, super-hot flashes followed by chills, mild nausea that comes and quickly disappears, lethargy, fatigue, and depression. No medicines seem to take these symptoms away, even after they clear up anything that was coincidentally there. And yes, I've had that POP that happens in my head, twice, and only while driving, that is so scary I have to pull over. Everything goes black for a few seconds, then stars, and then I'm normal again. Again, doctors can't find anything abnormal. So, each day I get worse and feel more isolated. I am single, childless, and live 25 miles from my family, which consists of two people now. I look and used to feel very young and vibrant. Now, I can't mow my own lawn, take walks, or do heavy household chores, and all this in the span of two or three months! Sometimes I feel so helpless. I've taken every natural menopause supplement I know about (soy isoflavones, black cohosh, vitex, dong quai, evening primrose, etc.) for over two years now. They no longer work. I am being pushed by a co-worker who has a naturopath friend to take BHRT, but I have been resistant because I heard the source was porcine hormones. I'm not interested in that nor Botox nor anything else from an animal, not that I am a vegan. It just seems sketchy to me. I find that valerian and skullcap and other remedies are also not working to calm my anxiety. Does anyone have suggestions for this and for the other horrible symptoms?"

I had a high level of inflammation, so the Dr. recommends me to a Rheumatologist because she says she is pretty sure it is Rheumatoid arthritis. I also had elevated liver enzymes which she said was probably from all the inflammation but she will be monitoring. I am borderline diabetic ... i told her I don't want to take medication I will try and control with diet. I don't drink alcohol so I don't understand the liver thing and I try to stay away from fried foods...  She did say I was premenopausal, but she said that has nothing to do the rest of the stuff going on , the only thing she did agree that was a symptom was the hot flashes which I don't get very often , she said that was because I'm probably done with menopause . I am 51 and I had a hysterectomy when I was 40 so I shouldn't really have menopausal symptoms? Can anyone tell me what a rheumatologist does to find out if it is or isn't arthritis?"

About 5 days ago I noticed a little blood when I wiped, that went on for the next couple days.

You start off on 0.25 and increase from there. Just curious because if in fact people are taking 5mg daily then their pcp has to be monitoring this quite closely. All of the recipes i see ladies on in the clinic im at are never quite that high. This new hrt i may try is Divigel..a gel you put on your thighs. No progesterone (hell no!) but estradiol only. the obgyn herself uses it so i thought id give it a try..im still not thinking it will help for this horrible out of touch depression im having forever. anyones thoughts? id love to hear experiences, dosing, etc. x0x0x"

From 40 to 45 I had bad anxiety, low moods, up moods, rage, was either extremely tired or bouncing, I turn 46 last October and I've kind of clued in that since about then I have very little feelings, sometimes I feel a bit happy, but I don't feel excited about anything, I don't feel sad, I don't know really how to describe it, I just feel blaaaaaa, boring. I'm single and did date a bit a couple of years ago, now that seems boring and too much work. Don't get me wrong, it's a great relief from the horrible crap I went through before, but it's like I just don't care. It's like I went from one extreme to the other. I still have very regular periods and I'm not on any meds at all. Just wondering if anyone has gone through this, is it a phase, maybe the calm phase between peri and meno?"

loonarider,2018-07-16T13:30+00:00,Feel like my life is over.,"I am 40 years old, and over the past month I have noticed changes within. Firstly, my period was 10 days later, although I felt all the symptoms a week before it was meant to arrive, only to experience them again. Shortness of breath has become ridiculous, where I think I may die in my sleep. For the past week to date , I am experiencing blockage in both ears, head pressure - sometimes the whole head, right side or left side and neck pressure. The head pressure is very frustrating, it isn't like a headache or migraine, its feels like my brains neurons are getting tangled up, sometimes the pressure spreads to my eyes even. Especially when lying horizontally at bedtime, do I feel the same head pressure and even more extreme, like it might explode, its scary plus the shortness of breath. Its like I might be better off dead as I don't enjoy this one bit. Its so bad that all the other symptoms (fatigue, mood swings, listlessness) don't bother me so much. Like rihht now, as I type, my neck feels pressure as well. So, I cannot hear, breathe, or think straight with the head pressure..What is the opint of living like this. In addition, I am a mature student and will be attending university.graduate school this September and wondering how I will cope with study.  Click here to view image"

I also have nausea which is like being pregnant all over again. I have had every test known to man and the only thing I have is low ferritin. I am taking 3 iron tablets a day and hope to get my levels up so I know it isn’t the iron causing the issue. I have had my hormones checked and told they are fine. Not sure what they were. (I am sure I am Peri - I am 45) I have been given the mini pill to level out hormones and hopefully stop me heavy periods. Does anyone have any experience with the mini pill? Thank you xxx

bev27429,2018-07-29T20:48+00:00,Considering ECT for the Psychological Symptoms of Perimenopause,"I have been dealing with the psychological symptoms of perimenopause for close to a year. I know that some women experience extreme mental health challenges during this time. I have done my absolute best to counteract my symptoms: clean eating, vigorous exercise, deep breathing / meditating, growing a garden, working full time, staying connected to others..., but the struggle remains. During this time, I have experienced deep depression, accompanied by scary thoughts and images that I can't get out of my mind. The more I try, the more intense they become. I have had intense anxiety with feelings of impending doom. There has been lots of crying and screaming. Sometimes, I feel totally detached from myself, almost as though I am not in my body, or I look in the mirror, and it is as though someone else is looking back at me, if that makes any sense. I still have some times of feeling like my old self, but they are fleeting, at the present time. I have been the strongest person that I know how to be through all of this, but it is so challenging to keep going. I remember one woman on this forum who queried: how am I to sit still whist on fire? That comment resonated with me so much. I am under the care of a psychiatrist, who I see regularly on an outpatient basis. I have brought up the idea of ECT with him, but more to get information on it. He indicated that the success rate is in the 90% range. I meet with him again next week, and I am going to discuss whether or not he thinks that I might be a candidate for this treatment. The ECT procedure has been dramatically refined since its inception. Antidepressants haven't worked, and progesterone made me even more depressed. ECT is a highly effective treatment, and I just want to be well. I want to have the happy me back who enjoys life, rather than just going through the motions and praying for my self to reemerge. Lately, though, I have noticed that if my mood does normalize, it seems to do so in the evening. I would be curious to hear women's thoughts. Thanks."
jackie81313,2018-07-24T06:18+00:00,Am I on the wrong HRT?,"Hello! I went to my Dr about a year ago after putting up with terrible night sweats, insomnia and general low mood for several months.  Bloods came back showing reduced hormone levels ( no surprise there - I had just turned 50!)  I was still having periods, albeit very infrequently.  The Dr put me on Premique Low Dose, and within a couple of weeks I was feeling so much better! No sweats, and as a result sleeping better and feeling a lot more cheerful.  But now they appear to have stopped supplying Premique LD, and the Dr has prescibed Femoston conti 1mg/5mg (which I haven't started taking yet).  On doing a bit of research it seems that I really shouldn't be on a continuous tablet, if I was still having occasional periods?  Is this really bad?? Also, the dosage of the new tablets seems too high, although I know that the active ingredients are a different formulation...are they comparable? Thank you for your advice!"

But after the latest bout of symptoms, I think I now know the culprit to be perimenopause! that is unless I'm just going crazy. Although mentally I feel 'normal' my moods are swinging so quickly that I can feel fine one minute and half an hour later, feelings of impending doom. I had a hyxterectomy at 34 and I am now 43 still with my ovaries, but now beginning to wish they had whipped them out at the same time rather than face years of trauma. currently I am having mock period I think, my chest is huge and sore. But apart from the mood swings, I am just tired, no motivation to do anything and I am a driven person usually.  lost my strength in the gym, too tried to do cardio and struggling to wake up in the morning, but pushing myself to stay focused and keep going even though I feel like I might have a crying fit any time. Please tell me this is normal?  I use the word 'normal' very loosely of course......"

My right ovary is more than 5 times the size it should be at my age and in meno, and my womb lining is 8mm, so abnormal. She couldn't even see my left ovary, due to very large fibroid. I've had moles removed that were just on the turn, but looks like the big C hasn't finished with me yet. I'm really scared. I can't get it across to anyone how scared I am, they just keep saying it'll be ok, but what if it's too late and its spread. I only reconnected with my eldest son a few months ago, and found out I have 2 beautiful granddaughters. Please god, let this be able to be dealt with, I have too much to live for now. Hope everyone is having a better day than me. Got the genetic breast cancer test next, then the test for Addison's disease. Looks like I may also have some form of spondylitis too, how much more is going to be heaped on me😢 still at least I've got the best care I can get from my Dr, I suppose that's something, but none of my friends or family seem to understand my fear.

But went 13 months the ladt time and due to thyroid surgery got a period. Im really scared right nowvmy anxiety is through the roof. The symptom im having which i will try to explain is crippling me. I used to call it an internal tremor which has come and gone over the years but its almost like im plugged into an electric current. Almost like my insides are buzzing/tingling constantly no let uo. I cant relax i feel agitated and terrified. Ive been through so much awful symptoms the last ten years i almost feel like my nerves just cannot deal with anything!!! I feel like im about to crack up or collapse i just dont know. Ive been in some very dark places last ten years with all this meno stuff i dont know if this is another real dip. I just dont know. I feel like im moving when sitting still my insides feel like they are shaking but its not visible. I have tegular thyroid checks all ok so far. Had tons of tests over last ten years all ok. I have had severe stress with one of my daughters last couple weeks. She had to move back home with my grandaughter due to domestic abuse. Is that making my symptom worse. I dont know!!!! I feel like its just got too much years of dealing with this no end in sight. Im not on any meds. I feel like i have something wrong but doctors find nothing. Im angry all the time!!!! I know this is a strange symptom but just hoping and praying someone can shed some light . Thankyou you all ladies God bless

I guess I won't no unless go back to work on Friday when my sick note runs out but tbh I'm thinking of leaving anyway if my doc won't give me another sick note as the way I've been treated is unforgivable since I first had the awful anxiety 10 months ago.

To be honest, I thought that once a year arrived then i would slack up posting or would see no need to post anymore. Well I was wrong. I thought by now, I would be doing much better. Well I have to admit that I am better than last year this time. Lately, at one point I was doing so well , and I'm sure many of you can relate .and BAM! Here I go again, peri is back! But never really left. Don't know if the word normal even exist anymore. I feel so worn out, so depleted and defeated. I mean day in and day out, I wake up and I already know what I'm waking up too. I feel there's nothing left in me..I 'm seeing a clinical nutritionist who also specializes in alternative and herbal . First off, I didnt have a good experience with the nutritionist that somehow I ended up seeing another one instead of the main nutritionist. What a bad week!! She prescribed the wrong supplements for my body. But everything turned around for me on that part. I think he end up firing her ..I'm sure she messed up other patients. The main nutritionist took over my case..and I immediately after the first week I was feeling better. He started treating my adrenals and also said i had parasites. I hadn't felt this way in a long time. I was finally able to sleep and not feeling wired up all day and staying up all night. Second week, he said i had candida and added it. I started reversing back to my first onset of peri, anxiety, shaking, wired up, etc. He lowered my dosage ..still same symptoms. I stopped the candida cleanse...only doing the parasite cleanse. This cleanse along with peri is nothing nice I tell you! Its like the cleanse reawaken everything and then brought more along. I never had hot flashes, but boy oh boy! They are nonstop!! Acid reflux , chest pain, shortness of breath , triple wired, more weight loss ( in which i cant afford) etc. At first I was skeptical, I mean really?? I came there for my perimenopause but he wants to treat me for something else? But then again he is the second naturopath that has said i have parasites, and i have been posting on issues like green poop, weight loss , etc. But I dont know if i can get through this..I am all worned out from this perimenopause and just wanting to feel better. Could my constant severe symptoms actually be coming from something else?"

Seems that a LOT of us suffer from ""health phobias"" though so, if people understand that, it helps quite a bit.   Ok, I'm 62 and tried every procedure, test and med going that is appropriate for my circumstances.  Finally, after bleeding daily now for months (sometimes heavy, sometimes light spotting or dark brown and cramping), having Simple Hyperplasia (NO Atypia), the 3rd gynaecologist and I have decided that I've tried it all and it's time for a Hysterectomy.  I'm booked to have it done Sept. 13th, 2018.  I'm SCARED!   This doc (because I'm prolapsed and she's been in there with a hysteroscope, doing a D&C as well as putting in a Mirena IUD...which I had to have removed 3.5 months later due to migraines and constant spotting and cramping) says that she can do this ""Vaginally"".  She said that she *may* have to resort to ""Lap Assisted Vaginally"" but, will try to do it all vaginally.   I have ""White Coat Phobia"" and ""Hospital Phobia"" now with great anxiety...so bad that I've put myself into possible Diabetes status (will see my family doc on Tues 24th of July).

When we are low as much of us obviously are or would’ve be in this site,)  we are basically dying.  estrogen has told our brains as women our job is finished and we can go now.!  wtf  Ate they just wanting to sell this hrt or is this true?  everything said makes total sense way it’s explained.  everything in our body relies in estrogen.  she says drs dont want to treat the hormones because they wouldn’t make money.  pharmaceutical co also fund medical schools and make sure curriculum is around treatment of symptoms not ROOT causes(hormones)   it wqs was basically said  either get on therapy hrt or its gonna get worse .  i know not every woman has terrible peri or menopause symptoms so can this be true?  ive made myself sick thinking this is it for me   gonna feel sick til i die w no hope."
Amalie13,2018-07-23T18:39+00:00,Insomnia,"Hello ladies.  My sleep schedule is completely out of kilter.  I can sleep from 4 AM to noon.   Which would be great, however I have a normal work schedule.  Ativan used to help me fall asleep at a timely hour, but no longer does the trick.   Any suggestions?  I have taken an antidepressant for 18 years, which probably has contributed to my insomnia (according to what I have read)."
Guest,2018-07-23T11:01+00:00,Could my wife be perimenopausal?,"My wife who is in her late thirties has had issues with post-natal depression and had been on anti-depressants for over five years although they didn't seem to help other than make her feel like an emotional ""zombie"". She came off the drugs and about a year ago said she was not happy with our relationship and wanted to separate. This seemed to come out of nowhere as I thought we were happy but just struggling with busy lives with children. We went to couples counselling for a bit but she found it too stressful so have stopped. We haven't separated as she said she I am a good person but she just doesn't love me and there is no emotional connection. She says it's only feelings and she doesn't know how long it will take to love me again but she wants ""space"". I have changed any behaviours she has told me she wasn't happy about (we had a ""traditional"" relationship which we have now rebalanced to be more equal. Plus I think I had been depressed and not very supportive of her as I was dealing with my own problems of work etc). We are now going out together more and spending more time together although she wants no intimacy and doesn't seem to desire me in any way. I've told her I understand she needs space to work on herself (she saw a CBT therapist about her anxiety) before she works on our relationship but it's hard going being in a relationship that feels very one way where I am giving affection (when possible) and showing concern and love but getting very little back. I wish she would talk to me more about how she is feeling and actually talking about our relationship but she doesn't seem ready. I stopped asking her how she felt about mw when she kept repeating how she didn't love me still. I do have resentment building that she has shut me out and won't talk but maybe it is just too tough if she is struggling to take on my emotions (initially I was devastated and upset about the question of separation but I'm now much more level headed). From the start I've suspected a ""chemical"" reason for her behaviour as she had stopped being the caring loving person she used to be. It may be all down to our relationship and it needing time to heal but I worry there is something else going on. She suffers from PCOS and I have mentioned that perhaps hormone levels are causing some of her feelings but she says she has been tested and there are no problems. I wonder if anyone has been through this similar situation (and come out the other end). At the moment I'm sticking by her because I love her so much (although it is awkward to tell her in this situation) but I don't know if I can go on like this without an end in sight. Maybe I just need to keep going but it would be nice to hear if there is a light at the end of the tunnel."

I underwent ROMA test recently in which ROMA value was calculated as premenopausal n it lied under high risk. It has been 11 months since last period.

We do so much sharing of all the awful things going on and our struggles, and I wondered if we focus on how brave, resilient and strong we are. So, I've been tasked by my new hypnotherapist /psychotherapist to keep a gratitude journal. The idea is, I focus on being proud of myself instead of permanently judging, negative thoughts etc...... So I thought if you're interested, we could start a thread to help us concentrate on what we are proud of /grateful for in our journey. I'm hoping you'll give it a go too ? here's mine: 1. I'm proud that I'm stronger than I ever thought. Even though it is hard each day, I'm up and functioning and that can be a challenge 2. I'm grateful for support from you ladies, my friends/family even though they don't understand they do their best! 3. I'm proud of myself for choosing treatments that work for me, and I'm not afraid to challenge my gp to get the right approach Please give it a go. I hope we'll have a thread where we can celebrate ourselves for once for how unique and tough we are. Lots of love, Sara xx"

I really want this to be a positive post , but something my husband just said has really got me thinking and worrying over . I am in the UK and have just been watching a programme about older , single celebrity ladies that have gone to Greece for the summer to find love . They have all been hurt by their exes who have no doubt left them for younger models . I remarked on this to my husband and he replied that an older man wouldn’t go with this particular woman aged 56 , but for someone much younger . I was taken aback and somewhat hurt by this , as he is very loving and caring towards me , but now I am wondering if this will happen to me in the future . I will be 51 next month and having countless peri symptoms , but I take care of myself as best I can , dress smartly and fashionably . The thing is my husband is 3 years younger and is he thinking like this and will want trade me in for a younger model ?

I notice that a lot of discussions about symptoms are a few years old and thought maybe I could start a new discussion on the topic to see if anyone else is dealing with the same things currently. I am 48 years old and still get my period. They aren't always regular, sometimes light as 2 days and some heavy for 5-7 days. my symptoms are: I feel disconnected from things going on around me sometimes anxiety that can be through the roof (mostly around my period) I can't stop obsessing about my health aches and pains mostly on my left side. Doesn't seem to bother me if I'm busy doing something or out for a walk. It's more of a dull ache accompanied with a tingling sensation that can start in my arm, through the bottom of my ribs and down to my thigh. My doctor says this is a symptom of anxiety, but I don't know if that's true. digestion problems stiff neck stiff shoulder dry mouth clogged ear night sweats I'm sure I could find more, but those are the ones that really scare me the most. I feel like anytime I sense one of these symptoms coming on it sends my anxiety into over drive and I can't calm myself down. The symptoms come and go, so I do end up feeling like I'm better and then bam a few days later I'm hit with something again! Sorry for the rant, just want to know if I'm not alone in this battle.

My hot flashes subside when I abstain from sugar. But my question is, do any of you ladies get a tingling sensation at night while sleeping. The sensation radiates from my bladder and it feels like an electric current. It's only present at night when I have a full bladder. I get up, relieve myself, then the sensation goes away. the doctors look at me like I'm crazy when I try to describe the symptoms. It's not painful, just uncomfortable. I'm so tired sometimes that I try to fall back asleep instead of heading to the bathroom, but the sensation is so strange and uncomfortable it pushes me to get up and relieve myself. It never happens in the daytime. I can hold my urine for long periods without this sensation. So strange. I would love some feedback around this issue."

Sassyr12a,2018-06-25T12:41+00:00,What Helps?.....,"Hi ladies I don't know if there is a thread where we can share what helps with some of the symptoms or what gets us through, but I'm hoping we can pool any tips. I'm 43, mother of 1 with primary ovarian failure diagnosed since 16.....basically menopausal forever. I've been on bhrt for 3 months. These are some things which I think have helped: - taking the bhrt is now starting to get results. I'm still anxious but it's not crippling as it was. - walking. I walk a few km every day, usually in the morning to help with the anxiety. - cycling. I got a new bike, so getting out on that really has made a difference. Its so much effort and concentration to stay on the flipping thing, that I forget for a while that I'm sometimes unhinged! - any kind of short cardio. I'll try anything, and a burst of effort raises my heart rate and even if I'm then face down in the sofa, I feel I tried! - GP. I spent such a long time trying not to be a pain in the butt at my local surgery, but now I don't care. If I'm not happy with meds, I phone them. If I need to see them, I phone them.... I've given up on worrying about being an inconvenience, now I'm getting my moneys worth! - homeopathy. I've been seeing one for years, but the combination of counselling and natural therapies works for me even if I spend the hour crying and wallowing! - mindfulness. I have the Headspace app on my phone, and every day even if for just 10 mins I create a bit of space in my mind which isn't plagued by insecurity - Internet. I try to use it to support my own research and not for taking quizzes to establish how bonkers I am or whether the pain in my neck is menopause or a thrombosis - menopause society. The organisation has a patient arm with an advisory service. So I can access a specialist nurse who helps. - forcing myself upright. Like everyone else , sometimes I'd like to set up home in a small cave until I feel better but it ain't gonna happen. So if I'm asked to go out... I go. I hardly ever want to and would rather stay in and watch judge judy, but the longer I do that I think the longer I'll suffer. Have you get any top tips ladies? Sara xxx"

acfierros,2018-07-18T21:20+00:00,Confused about menopause only have insomnia and anxiety,When I had my hysterectomy at 39 they removed my uterus and ovaries.  I went on hrt for two years then took myself off.  My mom does not believe I am going through menopause.  I am 45 years old and been having insomnia for months.  Also I do have mild depression and anxiety.  I went back to the doctor and told him I have not been on hormones since 2015.  He put me back on premarin and progesterone.  He says it will take about 6 weeks for the hormones to balance out.  I hope then maybe I should see an improvement in my sleep?  What do you think?
acfierros,2018-07-17T19:02+00:00,Upset with my current Gyn,Two weeks ago I was put back on premarin .625. He also gave me 100mg of progesterone. Since I have only been on these for 2 weeks I realize this is not enough time to see how the dosage will work. I have noticed increase anxiety and some heart palpitations. I called his office yesterday to see if maybe he could tweak the dosage because of this. His nurse called me back and told me that he says go see a cardiologist. I don't need to see a cardiologist. This is crazy. I have read that too little estrogen can cause these systems so why couldn't he raise the dosage of the premarin and maybe decrease the progesterone. I am not happy about this so now I am thinking just after reading a lot of my older posts years ago I did not ever do well on premarin. I regret going back getting on this again. I am thinking of getting a second opinion. I did go see an endocrinologist last week and she did take blood to check my DHEA.

Well I’ve come to the conclusion that we’re going through this ‘feeling ‘ 24/7 so it’s no wonder we are a mess. We are not piloting our own bodies anymore ! Relying on drs who rush us through our appt belittle us ... It’s like they are now in control of us and we are reliant upon them to make us feel better.

Mine has gotten so bad that I'm finding it so difficult to function on a daily basis. I'm trying to push myself and face my fears but it's still crippling and debilitating. Currently, I'm unable to go into big shops and anywhere busy. Struggled to go into my local shopping centre the other day and felt uneasy and panicky. Left after one shop. The rest of the day and night I felt so on edge and anxious. Today that feeling remains and I hate it. I can feel the tension in my throat, back and chest. I woke up in the middle of the night with a racing heart and feeling like I was gasping for breath.

rhonda86833,2018-07-04T00:41+00:00,"One Sore, Swollen Lymph Node....","Hello All, First post after lurking for several months. I appreciate this board and the insight it provides. Here is my question. For almost a year I have had a sore spot in my left armpit. It is not in the breast tissue that extends into that area, but higher up. I had an ultra sound in December and was told it was an enlarged lymph node and to keep an eye on it. Well, it has become larger so that it is actually a lump/knot rather than just a sore spot. I went to my GYN today (different than where I went before) and he agrees it is probably a lymp node. It is pea sized, moveable, and sore, which indicates to him it is something benign. I'm having an ultra sound and mammogram on July 13th, in his words to, ""confirm it's benign."" The area gets more sore when my period is due (along with my breasts) and I have sharp, shooting pains in that left breast too. These things have ramped up the anxiety/doom feelings of course, which makes the heart palps worse. This stuff is just too much fun. I should note, there are no other swollen lymph nodes (as far as I can tell) in other parts of my body. Does anyone else have experience with this?"

mauiblue,2018-07-11T23:17+00:00,Pregnenolone,"Click here to view image So i wanted to post something on this because i have been on it for 3 weeks, experimenting with how it works with my body. Im zero hormones post meno/16 months / 54. So because i didnt do well on the hrt/bhrt/antidepr.  etc.  i decided to try this after talking to a few medical folks that think it could help balance. In no way am i telling anyone anything other than to share my experience thus far. pregnenolone is the precursor of the other homrones like cortisol, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and dhea etc. and it kind of acts like an adaptogen in that it goes to where it needs to to help you balance out (or so it claims) for sure though it is the mother hormone. So i  am doing 30 mg every other day, and have been for 3 weeks. I can say that I am ever so slowly getting to feeling a tiny bit better. (i say this with caution because ive been battling this nightmare for 16 months) I am waking up now with less dread, less feeling overwhelmed. I still am really anxious in big stores, but its LESS. My mood amazingly is a little bit more normal, i feel like i used to a tiny bit. I kind of think it might be working? I felt it important to let you ladies know because it may help you, and if i can help anyone i WILL. Who is to say that i may or may not be turning a corner. but i feel like there is hope, and there is hope for all of us.

chucksusanb,2017-01-25T23:26+00:00,Has anyone had hot-flash warm flush in center of chest only?,"Hi there, I am 48 and have been going through signs of premenopause for 5 years. They started with skipped heart beats. I'm on toporol for that. I've had irregular periods the last two years. They are now starting to space out even more or skip a period completely before starting back up. My question is this: Has anyone ever had a hot flash surge in the chest only? It feels like a warm rush that makes my center of my chest and both breasts warm for about 10 thinking or 15 seconds then it goes away. Of course that completely freaks me out and then anxiety goes in full force. I had that happen a couple times last year and one time I went to the emergency room and then of course my cardiologist ran a bunch more tests including a cardiac CT scan. All was good. Thank you for reading and sharing your thoughts. Susan"

I've lost 15 pounds in last 4 months (which is a plus) but I feel fatigued and weak since I don't really have an appetite. My anxiety is through the roof, ears started ringing as well. My question can perimenopause cause all these symptoms, does it ever end? My first pregnancy was horrible, I had lot of hormone related issues, but they said it will pass, and eventually it did after few months .

I get hot and sweaty all the time, so much that I have to take an extra top to work in case I need to get changed. I am constantly washing my arms all day at work and when it's warm outside its horrendous. I feel so embarrassed.  I get headache all the time. I got my eyes checked last April and was told the headaches weren't anything to do with my eyes. I wake up with headaches often and sometimes they develop during the day and can't get rid of them.  My stomach bloats and sometimes it feels so uncomfortable it hurts. I've started using peppermint tablets which has eased the bloating. Often  I look 3 months pregnant! I've started  to feel so down when nothing different has happened. Today I've felt so unhappy but couldn't pinpoint why. This happened a couple of weeks ago. I hate feeling this way. I've started to ache more, e.g when I hoover up my back aches when I stand up after leaning over. I feel like I have a body like an 80 year old! I feel so tired at times, I can't concentrate when feeling like this.  Im not sleeping well either, but, I've looked at the days Im tired, they do not coincide with the nights I don't sleep. I mentioned being tired to my gp who checked my tsh, this came back normal. Any advice would be brilliant. Ashley  X"

I know my hormones and low mood make everything much worse, and magnified because im even more sensitive.  But im really feelin it theses days, its kind of like its a bit frightening. I wake up scared, almost haunted (as ive posted before) with the cortisol levels high, or whatever the heck is going on. My dreams are almost always negative, trying to escape or resolve or get out of some mess or another. I almost think that during this time we are in a heightened state of ""meno consciousness"" if you wiill. I know this sounds probably whack..but its my perception these days that its a heavier world. We have to pull together to really keep the positive going, and like some ladies have mentioned praying..i think its due, i think that any sort of support we can throw out to eachother and others is desperately needed during these times.

Guest,2018-07-07T13:47+00:00,The gyn who doesn’t take peri seriously (requested by Kazjo),"Kazjo asked me to share about my experience with my ex-gyn.  I hope this helps.  Two years ago, I was referred by a GP to a female gyn exactly my age (now 47).  I liked her at the first visit, but we were dealing with a specific situation that led to laparoscopic surgery and all exams and testing were specific to that.  The surgery went okay, but she and her staff made mistakes with my post-op prescriptions, leave paperwork for my employer, and other details.  Still, I liked her enough to go back for checkups. Last year, I had trouble with new symptoms and went to her to request lab work.  She ordered it, but when it came back, I got three separate interpretations from her and two of her nurses after another round of follow-up testing.  I took the results to my GI doctor since the testing was about vitamin levels and he interpreted it for me correctly and answered my questions.  I started looking for a new gyn but unfortunately had to visit her one more time for a possible infection.  I decided to try to talk with her about my peri symptoms and concerns.  She responded with a hostile, dismissive tone, saying that these are just “normal” things and telling me that I need a psychiatrist and medication.  However, I want help with these physical symptoms.  I know from having had a chronic illness for 22 years that getting help with the physical will help me emotionally to feel better, knowing that I am supported. The good news is that I have finally chosen a new gyn and am setting up an appointment.  I chose a highly respected male doctor, coincidentally also my age, who is one of the top practitioners in his field in our community.  A good friend who is one of his patients recommends him highly.  I am hopeful that things will go well."

I know a lot of you ladies have spoken about waking up depressed, low mood, dark thoughts, feeling like you're in flight or mode etc. But it seems to get better as the day goes on. One of the ladies did explain that cortisol is higher in the morning and may be the reason for the terrible feelings and it lowers throughout the day so we feel better later in the day. ?BUT, has anyone woke up terrified? I mean literally afraid to get out of bed? That happened to me this morning. I have had many mornings(who am kidding, that's most mornings) where I didn't  feel like getting out of bed, but being scared to get out of bed is a new one. Then I cried on the way to work.  My health anxiety is also bad again. Are any of you afraid you are dying of something and you won't be able to live out your dreams and goals(whatever they are,  everyone has different dreams and goals some of mine are marriage, traveling, long healthy retirement, long life, and health for family). ?I pray, exercise, drink plenty of water, take a good multivitamin, magnesium, fish oil, D3. I take a mild antidepressant(it's a SNRI, not a SSRI because the side effects are so nasty). I have Valium, but don't take it very often because I don't want to get addicted(they're like my security blanket in case of the really bad days and believe it or not I didn't take any today lol). Honestly I wonder how I would cope if I wasn't doing the few things I am doing to feel better. I don't think I've ever talked to God so much or been closer to him."

I am getting tinnitus off and on, and It seems to happen when I'm laying down.  Also neck position or my jaw opening or closing makes it start or stop sometimes.

Kazjo,2018-06-02T18:50+00:00,Menopause/Trying something new...,"Hi Ladies!  Ok, I'm 53. No period for 16 months straight. Last year, hot flashes arrived. They were tolerable. I'd have them every day for a few weeks then they'd disappear and come back a few months later, lasting a few weeks. This March, they came back with a vengeance. All of March, April and May I was on fire at least 10 times a day. Couldn't get my clothes off fast enough. Plus, night sweats every night, resulting in poor sleep. Now, June 2, I'm noticing I've been having fewer each day and less intense. I have to keep hope that they will come and go like last year.  Or just disappear. From my lips to God's ears.... I've been taking supplements of Black Cohosh and an E-Plexx for ladies but not sure that they helped at all. So when I run out, I won't try them again. E-Plexx is expensive. So, I will start back on prenatals (yes!) and my 2,000 IU of Vitamin D3 and see if that does anything. I'll keep checking back to let you know if anything changes.  Also, I had my blood tested to see my type: Type O Positive. I have a book (you can just go online as well) to see what foods are Highly Beneficial (HB)  what is acceptable and what to avoid. So, I'm concentrating on adding those foods that are HB, enjoying the acceptable (which is plentiful) and avoiding almost everything they claim is really bad for my blood type. That includes coffee and bread, which I won't give up but will cut back. It's worth a (natural and healthy) try to get rid of the hot flashes, inflammation, extra weight, mood swings, and the Sahara desert situation I have going on ""down under.""  Also, I'm exercising more. It just has to be done...my body has never looked or felt this bad. So, I'm making daily choices and concerted efforts. I hope you will look at your diet and exercise regimen and see if making good changes work for you. Let me know! Let's get thru this together. -Kaz"

This past week it has progressed to my ankle and foot on both legs and the other knee hurts at times but is not swelling. I have no idea if I hurt myslef perhaps doing spring cleaning but this is terrible. It fatigues me and I am not able to move as freely as usual. Definitely cannot bend it or kneel on it. The swollen knee hurts to the touch on the inside. And at night it even hurts in my sleep...like an abcessed tooth. Anyone dealing with this?

Up until 2wks ago when i should have started (6wks had passed) but all ive had is light spotting/streaking! This has been on and off for 2wks now.

I would appreciate your advice. Oh btw...im putting on weight even tho i feel im not eating more plus ive started aqua aerobics! Help....will i eventually lose this extra weight?

I had no life I could not ever feel awake and spent all day in and out of bed. The fatigue was immense I could have gone to bed at 4.30pm and if I did have one good day and went to dinner boy I suffered the next day . Now I’m up in the morning AWAKE ! My dizziness has subsided and it’s like night and day from 2 weeks ago. I feel NORMAL  I spent 3 months in HELL!  Fatigue dizziness even bloody suicidal . My life isn’t what I want it to be right now as recently divorced so I get lonely but I can deal with it . Life is too short to feel like I’ve felt. I’ve noticed a bit of bloating in my stomach but if that’s it .... I’ll deal with it and just do more sit ups !

I have been experiencing this for two years now. Drs don't know why so are calling it fibromyalgia. I just wanted to know if anyone has found relief somehow (I can't take pain killers they don't work anyway)? I have tried nearly all the natural therapies. I also get awful heavy headaches and depression when I have a particularly bad flare. I have seen all the specialists and been told my hormone levels are normal.

My symptoms are weird and all over the place. Finally Dr's chalked it up to anxiety, depression, or possibly fibromyalgia....grrr...basically, no answers. I track all my symptoms as well as charting my BBT and notice that my cycle is all over the place. My temps are erratic which lets me know my hormones are fluctuating. I feel like a mental mess and some days i steuggle to get thru. Feel like i'm dying here 😢 Here are my symptoms. They are not consistent. They are hit and miss: -Weepiness, Anxiety and Depression, mostly after period ends up until mid cycle, not everyday -Off balance feeling (but not off balance...It's weird, like walking on marshmellows) -insomnia -Sore breasts from mid cycle until period -muscle tightness/ache (randomly and everywhere but especially in shoulders and neck) -ocassional random skin crawling feelings -Tinnitus (comes and goes) - jittery feeling (tested neg for diabetesblood sugar levels were normal) -irregular cycles and lighter periods (I was always regular until symptoms started) -occasional tummy issues -on and off fatigue -weird eye symptoms -night sweats -zero sex drive -And a weird spaced out feeling. Like twilight zone weird. Hate this feeling! -sometimes feel light headed upon standing. Get a feeling of a ""gush to my head (had my heart checked...everything looked ok) The list goes on but that gives you an idea. I feel like i'm losing it. I have been to several gp' s, rhumatologist, neurologist and once I figured out that it might be hormones then i went to an OB..she wasn't much help. Pages of labs and tests turn up nothing. Thyroid tested several times and all normal. Blood Hormonal panel came back a little weird but was taken at the wrong time of the month. Saliva hormone test came back showing low hormones but was also taken at the wrong time. Both tests were taken at mid cycle and then compared to post ovulation levels. I would think an experienced OB would know better but i guess not. Ladies, any of you go thru this? I've taken so many supplements and even tried progestrone cream. Dr. Told me to up the amount of cream to a much higher dose and literally the next day all of my symptoms were exaggerated big time. A low dose didn't seem to hurt me but a large amount def did something. At a loss here. Courage needed ??"

First times were when i first started my monthly. (about 11 )  Off and on but mostly just every once in a long while i’d experience this.  Over the years more but still just not often.  I noticed it got bad and way more frequent last 5-10 yrs.  Right around peri time.  I realized all my life it was triggered by hormones.  But very unpleasant anyway.  For me it was like id be having a conversation or just sitting watching tv or at work etc and it would be like id get a sweeping bizarre feeling like ive had this exact conversation or experience already.  I hear th same music in my head each time and i feel lil weak and confused for like lesa than a minute.  Usually had to put my head down but im not dizzy just have to have the experience and let it pass.  afterward im sleepy and strangely relaxed.  Only thing i can come up with researching  tons is catamenial epilepsy???  I dont have that.  But the “aura” ppl explain sound alot like deja vu.  Once inpassed out,  well a few times only out of all these episodes.  They never found anything. I was in a bookstore and felt it and kinda bent down so not to feel so unstable and fell over and wet myself. Spilled my purse out and came to real quick and felt fine.  I think a seizure would make you disoriented for a few min.  This was so short and i was back up that nobody ever saw it.  lol"

Anyways . . .  I am about 50 & going through peri-menopause and out of blue started experiencing ""passing out"" episodes which they think may be a seizure and both times it happened after few months of ""no period"" time and then ovulating again and pretty much between ovulation/right after ovulation - start of period time.  I read that either estrogen levels being high which of during ovulation or progesterone levels being low during the times that I experienced fainting spells etc. which they think might be a form of seizure. Never ever had a problem with it before yet during my periods always felt like my BP was low, and had pretty heavy PMS symptoms all my life.  So I will try to up my progesterone levels via natural remedies during ovulation - start of period times from now and on and see what happens. Any comments?  Anyone with such experience?

Louise4586,2018-06-30T10:37+00:00,Is this the beginning of the menopause journey,"Hello Ladies, I am wondering how you you knew that you were in the perimenopause stage? I am 45 in 2 weeks. My problems started over 2 years ago. Mostly light dizzy spells especially in shops. I did have a seizure and the only thing they found was low ferratin due to heavy periods. At this point I was probably also suffering from achy legs and nausea which was mostly in the morning. The dizzy spells have got much worse and are now constant. A few people started to mention the menopause to me and at first I disregarded it. However the last 6 months or so my monthly cycles have changed - much closer together - usually about 23/24 days and then an odd cycle at 29 days. My periods are heavy and last from a day to a week. i have tried to monitor my symptoms and they do change over the month but I can't see a clear pattern I have started to take a herbal menopuase supplement, evening primrose oil, b6, b12 and d vitamins. Sure the achy legs are much better and the nausea reduced. No change to my dizziness.  Finally the last 2 months I have dreadful anxiety, scared to go anywhere alone?  Does this sound like the beginning of the menopause? Has anyone taken at HRT at this stage? I am happy to take anything to help.  Appreciate any advise"

I took it for several years and then took myself off.  I am now 45.  I have not had estrogen since 2015.  Insomnia is bad, anxiety is higher, and depression has been around more.  Nothing in my life has changed.  I don't know why I all of a sudden I don't feel like my old self.  I am going to see my old Gyn on Monday.

I have tried repeating positive mantras, using mindfulness and meditation, but they don't seem to have the power to counteract them, especially when the thoughts become particularly intense. Sometimes, I just resign myself to the thoughts, and then I notice that they eventually go away, all on their own accord. Even though I have lots to look forward to, I feel filled with fear and an inability to cope. I keep feeling that my life is over, even though I know that this isn't rational. I have lots to look forward to. I did have a lot of stress last year: a bad business break-up involving litigation, moving my home, finding new office space and rebranding, as well as taking care of my sick dog. I also notice that I have been having sad dreams. I had to put my 12-year-old dog down earlier this year, and she keeps coming back to me in my dreams. I don't know why this stage of life gets the brain focusing so much on loss. I would so like to let go of the worry and depression. Yesterday, even though I felt awful, I forced myself to do an out of town bike race with my boyfriend. I know that getting out was definitely a smarter choice than staying home because I think that making choices to engage in life is the best way to turn things around. For most of the day, my thoughts were just swirling, but I did notice little periods of calm and happiness, where I felt like ""my old self"". I also noticed that the really heavy depression tends to lift in the evening. Are there other women out there with similar experiences? If you can share your thoughts and stories, that would be very much appreciated."

I am 44 years old and in January this year, after some tests, I've been diagnosed with perimenopause. I still get my periods, but my cycles are all over the place. I have no one to talk to, because I find it uncomfortable burdening my friends with this stuff, as they are all much younger than me, and won’t be able to relate and my husband, as wonderful as he is, is still a man, that definitely can't relate. I've read a lot of different topics on this forum, from women who are going through the same thing, but one symptom hasn't been raised and that's depression. I feel like I am loosing myself in the process, I get very depressed, although by nature, I am a positive and outgoing person, who loves life. I can cry for days with no reason, I don't want to be around anyone, I feel like I am falling into a dark hole of depression and getting farther away from everyone and everything in this world. It's the only way I can describe this. I constantly have back pains, leg pains, joint pains, leg cramps. I am endlessly tired and lazy, I don't want to do anything. I've turned into a hypochondriac and constantly think that there's something wrong with my health. I can't take hormonal substitutes, because of bad cancer history in my family, so I try all these different natural supplements, but it's like playing a lottery, so far, I've tried 3 different kinds and nothing really works. Please, if you are battling the same thing, let me know, maybe we can help each other. I am at my wits end and my husband recommended me writing on this forum to ladies that are going through the same thing."

teri76755,2018-06-26T11:40+00:00,Irony of Menopause,"My friend was diagnosed yesterday with stage III cancer which was discovered almost by accident. She was virtually asymptomatic. It was devastating news for her and her family. I, on the other hand, have been trying to cope with numerous symptoms associated with menopause - all of which I’m told are ‘normal’ yet are leaving me feeling unable to get through my day. Anxiety and panic attacks, heart palpitations, dizziness, lightheaded, constant ear & sinus pressure (no ear infection), body aches, plus the usual hot flashes. So menopause just makes us feel like we’re dying I suppose? I feel guilty for feeling this way over a normal human right of passage. My doctor wants me to take Lexapro but something keeps telling me not to do it. The worst symptom has to be the panic attacks. I feel like I should be able to get through these episodes on my own or maybe take medication that would help in the moment...rather than an antidepressant that I’d take daily. Feels like using a chain saw to cut butter so to speak! Just venting!"

sn21848,2018-06-26T01:44+00:00,Seriously it is like whack a mole...,"So I think I started a pity party discussion not to long ago. So this is my story in a nutshell. 1. Was done with menopause at 52. Don't know when I officially stopped because I was on the pill. Plus I had to have my gall bladder out at the same time. 2. Had balance issues, cognitive issues, digestive issues, dryness, severe anxiety, weight gain, etc. 3. Been on HRT but that didn't fix much. Thyroid tests good. Started to realize that progesterone make me feel lousy. 4. Tried to go off hormones 3 times in the last year but my life came to a stand still. 5. Found out that my uterine fibroid tumor doubled in size and my doctor keeps asking me do I want to take my uterus out so I can just take estrogen. My answer is no and I can ultrasound the tumor out but he's concerned with cancer. 6. Was over joyed that my uterine lining is thin and my mammogram was good but then the other shoe dropped. 7. I have osteopenia which can turn into osteoporosis. The nurse who called said it isn't that big of a deal but my bone density when from normal to this in 4 years. My mom and my grandma had osteopenia. I tried just 2mg of progesterone cream about 4 days ago and I got so edgy I could have hit someone. 8. Oh and I don't seem to be able to tolerate Vitamin D supplements. They make me feel lousy and dry. I went to a nutritionist today and we went over several foods that might make my situation a little better and I am going to order the genetic testing from the site 123 along with the ancestry part because right now I am spitting in the wind. Oh and every time I do down on my HRT my body temperature get cold. I haven't slept 8 hours in 10 years and it is wearing on me at 57. I feel like a fruit fly."

No period for 14 months and night sweats, insomnia, some brain fog and severe pins and needles and burning pain in my legs, feet, arms, hands and face for the last 7 months.  After numerous MRI's, nerve and blood testshe neurologist thinks it could be the menopause or fibromyalgia (not typical symptoms).   He has advised HRT patches even though I have history in my family of blood clots and stroke.  Have decided to try the patches to see if the burning pain and pins and needles go.  Very scared though. Started patches Monday night and today have felt very nauseous and thought I was going to be sick.  Have other people had nausea and it has only been for a short time?? Also has anyone experienced severe pins and needles?? thanks"

I thought id list my symptoms for those who are only new to the site or are just beginning to experience them. I am also on 2mg HRT. These symptoms were spread out over 5 years and reoccur. Please feel free to do the same as may help other ladies starting out on this road. My change first began with  1. one week of hot flushes then they stopped 2. All of a sudden I felt like I couldn't breath as if someone was sitting on my chest and couldn't get enough oxygen in my lungs 3. Heart palpations just started while just sitting watching TV and ended up in A&E  totally embarrassed as I thought I was having a heart attack. So frightened - nothing wrong with me 4. Anxiousness like you are going for an interview multile feeling x 5, and at times feeling overwhelmed in my mind and with life 5. Loss of Joy, lots of crying and reflecting on life a lot, lots of doom and gloom. no point in being here 6. Shingles, thrush in my month and in private parts due to low immune system with hormone deficiency  7. Migraine type headaches with dizziness and weird sensations in my head - awful 8. Stiffness when getting up in the morning and joint pains  9. IBS  - this has been one of the worst for me. Wind and nauseas with constant wind in belly with belching, good and bad days ongoing 10. Waking up throughout  the night needing to pee 5-6 times and heat surges 11 waking up through the night with an awful thirst after being fully hydrated throughout the day, feeling faint with low sugar level- had to eat large bowl of porridge which helped- Blood work done and all fine. 12. Strange heat in my tummy, sometimes behind the eyes and other parts of my body! 13. Butterfly feelings in my abdomen, as a lady in here described it, bunnies in her tummy!!  But there is light at the end of the tunnel. I am getting through this and feel much better now. I still get the above but not as severe and I am able to cope if they do. My joy is back and I feel so much better as this season is passing.  I hope that if you experience the above, you know that you are not alone and however frightening it is, you can share here.

Any help?,"Hello, ?I have Pmdd symptoms the 3 days before my period starts  for the last 6 years which has become progressively worse year by year...affecting my last relationship and generally my social life... ?On May 2016 I had a sudden laparoscopic surgery due to ovarian cyst rupture...Since then my life has been a torture! ?I have all the perimenopause symptoms on a daily basis.. I quit my job , I quit everything because of the horrible pains. ?The first new symptom after my surgery was gastritis and reflux ( I think that antibiotics that prescribed after the operation played a role to the manifestation of gastritis) ?I felt burning stomach till my throat for first time in my life within a week after finishing the antibiotics...lump sensation in my throat, excessive amounts of burping, no appetite ( during the whole summer 2016 I had no appetite at all and I lost kilos), excessive saliva and generally speaking all the symptoms of reflux. ?I did the appropriate exams and the results were mild gastritis, multiple events of NON acid reflux ( meaning saliva) and a little bile reflux. The doctor prescribed me riopan gel instead of PPI ... In June 2016 another doctor gave me omeprazole and I became worse, I was coughing and couldn't breath. ?At the same time for first time in my life, I had allergic rhinitis! I was prepscirbed antistamine and spray for my sinus. ?The other constant symptoms that I have are constant fatigue, IBS  ( gas, diarreah along with constipation), severe mood swings irritablitity and depression, panic attacks agoraphobia, yelling to my mother without reason and after crying ( it is uncontrollable), non existant sex drive, hot flashes and cold chills, insomnia, itching and formication on my scalp, constant dreaming ( vivid dreams every night), heart palpitatiosn here and there, joint and bone pain especially when the weather is hot and humid, hypoglucemic episodes every day...Pmdd the week before my period starts...the only week that I feel better is the third week of my cycle... I also  have to mention that I can feel my ovulation ( sometimes I have early ovulation maybe the 9 or 10 day ) and it is very painful and I am crying all the day.. ?I visited many and different doctors and I was telling them that I believe that I have hormonal issue and they insisted that I am too young for this...Go to a psychiatrist, you have anxiety disorder ?Finally last month, I visited a new doctor and my blood hormone results are the following: FSH 20,3 LH 18,3 Estradiol 23 ?the ultrasound showed a large ovarian cyst approximately 6 cm that has to be removed surgically! ?The doctor told me that my ovaries are still working well??? but  the values are not compatible to my age! I described him again all of my symptoms but he did not seem to believe me how much interfering with my daily life ?I am sure that I am going through perimenopause stage and no help had been offered to me. ?What else can I do in order to ameliorate my psychical and emotional symptoms? I am desperate..My life is over ?In my opinion I am very young to feel like this..Perimenopause may start at early 40's or after 35 but no at 30's..This is not normal, it is a disease..Is it genetic or sth autoimmune which affects the function of my ovaries? ?What can I do to help my body? I want to become active person again...SInce May 2016, the most days I am house bound Thank u and sorry for the long post"

Then, I just start beating-up on myself and focusing on any perceived flaw. When I feel well, though, I am confident, upbeat, and excited about the future. My self image is healthy, and I have perspective. I just feel so frustrated, and then I start second guessing myself: are my thoughts and feelings being caused by perimenopause or something else? I can only think that it is hormones, because when I get a settling of my mood, I want to socialize, organize my home, develop my business, just enjoy life. I am forcing myself to stay busy and complete a list of tasks each day, no matter how I feel. I exercise daily (a lot), eat well, meditate in the morning, practice deep breathing when my thoughts overwhelm me...

My mom went through a few years during her peri when she could not be by herself and now I'm like that, too.  It is just horrible and isolating.

sentoholistics,2018-03-19T20:18+00:00,Perimenopause Bleeding & Norethisterone,"Hi. I'm looking for some advice and possibly reassurance from anyone going through the same thing as me.  Basically, I turned 50 in September last year but I think I have been perimenopausal since my early 40s. My periods started becoming erratic in 2015 and I had a scan which showed an endometrial polyp. This was removed in the July and my periods were normal after that until November 2015 when I started my period as usual but never stopped. The bleeding was light and intermittent to start with but by Christmas I was bleeding so heavily and passing such large clots, I couldnt leave the house. A scan showed a thickened lining and I was referred to gynaecologist, but only as a routine so didn't get an appointment until the August! Meanwhile, the bleeding continued and I became anaemic. I had a second hysteroscopy in September 2016 and a second polyp was removed. I started bleeding again at the end of October and again didn't stop. By this time I had moved county so had to start all over again with gynaecologist referrals. The bleeding became a bit intermittent and every time I saw the gynaecologist, I wasn't bleeding so we decided to watch and wait, but by mid 2017 the bleeding had become pretty constant again and I decided enough was enough and had an endometrial ablation.  I was so positive that this would be the end of my problems, but sadly it wasn't to be. I had the usual post ablation bleeding but this continued for several weeks before it stopped. I then had intermittent bleeding and brown discharge, until in November I had intense cramping pain and heavy bleeding again. I was advised I need another hysteroscopy and a pelvic ultrasound. The ultrasound showed a thickened lining at the top of my womb and a query polyp - result ablation had failed. The gynaecologist thought another hysteroscopy was a waste of time as the scarring from the ablation would prevent anything being seen and he put me on Norethisterone (progesterone) for 3 months straight, and to then repeat the ultrasound at that point.  The Norethisterone stopped the bleeding straight away and I had two lovely months of no bleeding. But then I started with intense itching all over my body, extreme fatigue, a need to wee every two hours at night (which compounded the fatigue), painful leg cramps and restless leg syndrome and headaches. A blood test showed my liver function was borderline and a repeat three weeks later showed it was abnormal. I was taken off the Norethisterone as it was felt this was the cause of my bad liver function. I am waiting to have a repeat blood test in a week to see if it has now improved.  I came off the Norethisterone on Thursday. On Sunday I had brownish discharge and in the early hours of Monday I had severe pelvic pain and started bleeding properly. The pain was unbearable, no pain meds would touch it and I was on the point of collapse and going to A&E when I had a massive bleed and the pain eased. A few hours later I passed the largest ""clot"" I have ever seen, which was about the size of my fist and looked more like tissue than blood (sorry if TMI!). The bleeding has slowed since then but I still have the pain, although not as bad.  Has anyone else experienced this when coming off long term Norethisterone and if so, does it settle down?  I think I am now going to ask for a hysterectomy as I need my life back and there's nothing else I can take that will work. Thanks"

jo4848,2018-06-18T06:19+00:00,"Super heavy uncontrolled bleeding, waiting for referral SCARED","Hi ladies, I have posted on here before but now I am really scared. I am 45 and my issues started last year with spotting after exercise. An US revealed a small fibroid and possibly a polyp but the 2 hysteroscopies I had failed to successfully remove it due to where it was in my tilted uterus. My periods had also started to get heavier although painless. Two biopsies came back clear so the specialist suggested it was hormonal and I was put on the progesterone only pill (Cerazette). I had my first really scary bleeding episode in Feb, just before starting the pill. It was the last day of my period which was nearly stopping and then I started flooding and couldn't leave the toilets in McDonalds for ages. We were out shopping in a different town and I felt awful, thought I'd have to go to A&E but eventually stopped it after taking ibuprofen which seems to work for me.  Soon after this I started taking this pill which made my periods longer and I was also either spotting or bleeding almost every day. I am quite annoyed with my GP who doesn't seem to care, told me it's quite normal for your period to affect your life and refused a blood test, telling me to just take some over the counter iron. She didn't even warn me that the most common side effect of this pill is frequent bleediing. So I took this for 3.5 months, reading everything there was on the internet about how it is meant to settle after 3-6 months and tried really hard to put up with it. I bled almost the whole time, with just 10 clear days but 10 days ago I had another really scary bleed. It was uncontrollable and took ages to stop. I had to sit on the toilet for ages as the thickest sanitary towels would not contain it for more than a few minutes. I am also a teacher and this was really stressing me out as I was living in constant fear that it will happen during a lesson. I was taking ibuprofen or transexamic acid which controls it but you can't take these forever.  Then last Friday I had another episode at work, the worst by far. I had to dash out of class and just couldn't stop bleeding. It was really scary. I was passing massive clots and just couldn't move away from the bathroom. Had to use a tena lady and my friend drove me home. I called the surgery who offered me an appointment at 4pm (it was 10.30 am) or told me to go to A&E. I was really scared and called 111 who sent an ambulance as my heart rate was through the roof and I was short of breath. By that point I'd taken a lot of transexamic acid which eventually worked but the whole thing lasted 90mins and was the scariest time of my life. I don't remember childbirth being that bad and I'm sure I didn't bleed as much. I was put on a drip and admitted to a ward but because the bleeding had subsided, they didn't perform any procedures. They also couldn't refer me directly so had to write to my GP and told me to call them on Tue and chase it up as they would need to urgently refer me. I was put on Utovlan which is norethisterone and this stopped the bleeding straight away but I only have a 10 day course and am already dreading what would happen when I stop it. Surgery are supposed to prescribe me a lower maintenance dose the Dr said but they are so uncaring and all they want to do is give me the coil which I am not keen on. Really sorry about long post but would love to hear from someone who's been through something similar. I am scared of drastic procedures but over the weekend have decided that I want a hysterectomy as this has been going on for far too long. It stopped me running and exercising which is something I love and now it's stopping me from doing my job which I also love. I have been signed off for a week, possibly longer, and scared to leave the house in case it starts again. I am also quite aneamic as a result and keep getting out of breath after just a few steps (was finally prescribed high dose iron tablets for this).  Any similar experiences and advice will be much appreciated. This thing has taken over my life and I hate it :*("

My thyroid and other blood work came back normal. He wants me to take a low dose of Lexapro. I’m on the fence about this because the side effects are similar to what I experience with anxiety. I am also concerned about starting a medication that might be difficult to get off of later on. If my symptoms are caused by menopause, this isn’t a permanent condition (I hope!) Just like to hear from folks who’ve tried this to treat menopause related symptoms. HRT is not an option for me bc of significant family history of stroke and heart disease."

My thyroids are overactive. I've never had thyroid problems before this perimenopause. In addition, while having my echo and stress test for my heart, they find my left lung has fluid on it. Now being sent to a lung specialist. This is really freaking me out. Im not a smoker, not around smoker , etc. My doctor did say that hypothyroid can cause this, but i am hyperthyroid. I could have been hypo at one time. I just started having problems with the breathing and chest hurt after taking the beta blocker last week that the doctor prescribed for the heart palpitations. I went to see cardilogist for heart palpitations not the breathing or chest hurt... But after taking beta blocker there's fluid on lungs along with chest hurting, and shortness of breath. I was not prescribed anything for my thyroid. The dr said didnt want to because it may mess thyroid up even more because she thinks the underlying problem is actually the adrenal gland. Now, question has anyone experienced thyroid issue , or fluid on lung? or just saying anything to help calm my nerves about all of this. No more google because it has really cause my anxiety to be in overdrive. The weirdest thing about all of this is that before my stomach (gastritis) was the major issue but it has calmed down tremendously. I can now eat without being afraid of having a side effect."

I've had extreme anxiety, mood swings, from crying to rage and insomnia. I have tried every natural remedie, vitamins, diets, lots of excercise, even tried antidepressants and anxiety pills, nothing worked, actually the antidepressants made things worse and my doctors remedie to that is to try the red kind of antidepressants. A friend suggested medicaL marijuana, for many reasons I delayed trying it for a couple years. Last week I gave in as my anxiety was through the roof and I needed sleep. It's only been a week and I have slept way better the last week than I have in a few years, and my anxiety is controlled, just having sleep has brightened my mood. I did research it's uses for menopause symptoms I'm not using enough to be high as a kite, just enough to take the edge off and still function. It's only been a week so will continue seeing if it works through my cycle. I realize it may not be legal everywheres but it's a thought. Has anyone else tried this?"

thehotgirl,2018-06-16T23:51+00:00,"Not to be dramatic, but...","I am so happy to find you guys.  I feel like you're my people!  I am dying from menopause, or at least I think I am.  Here's my story, as brief as I can manage.  Six months ago I had my neurotransmitters checked because I was having increasing insomnia and the Bhrt I tried seemed to make my anxiety skyrocket.  Five months ago,I went from New Year's Day until the 11th sleeping an average of 2-3 hours a night.  Some nights not at all.  It was an absolute nightmare.  The weirdest thing was, I wasn't tired even during the day.  I was revved up constantly.  My neurotransmitter testing showed I was super high in adrenaline and low in GABA and Serotonin (among others things,but those are the main ones)  After 11 days, I told my dh I couldn't do anohter night.  I either had to get to the doctor or I'd be going to the ER that night.  No way could I stay awake another night, I was melting down.  Finally got to the doctor and got prescriptions for Remeron and Ativan (both of which I've taken successfully several years ago)  That night, I slept 7 hours.  I was absolutely *terrified* to take them, but I did and it worked fine.  The weird thing is, instead of being exhausted the next day (which is common after starting Remeron) I was fine.  Like nothing was happening.  Clearly I was burning that stuff off with ease.  As the weeks passed I got good, reliable sleep, but I didn't wnat to be on anything.  Got sent to the therapist to learn some new behaviors (has really worked, imo), went off the Remeron after 3 months. Take the Ativan every third day or so. Everything was working fine, but the anxiety started back up for real last weekend.  I have done a ton of research on this and I completely believe it's reactive hypoglycemia. Asked my ARNP and she scoffed that menopause would cause hypoglycemia (really?  Cuz the Mayo clinic on their website says otherwise) and that hypoglycemia would cause anxiety as bad as I was having it. Really? Then how come I get anxiety whenever I eat?   I tried keto, to correct it,but my gallbladder went crazy. Spent a month with that being on the brink of trying to kill me, it has finally settled down to almost normal, praise God.  Let's see, what else.  Insomnia, anxiety, gallbladder, stiff neck and shoulders, sore tongue...  God, it never ends.  I read the sore tongue is related to gallbladder.   So, what have I tried that I can pass on?  Well, first, I have to say, I'm taking Remeron tonight as the insomnia is creeping back to the point where I fall instantly asleep, wake up in 2 hours, am awake for 2 hours, then fall back asleep for about 3 hours. Don't get me wrong, I'm utterly grateful for that broken 5 or 6 hours, given where I came from.  But I am not a person who can go without sleep. Someone's going to get hurt and it's probably not going to be me.   Okay, here's what I've had good results with.  I am slowly, carefully, with great apprehension trying to work my way up to a full dose of otc progesterone cream.  I'm not even at a quarter of a dose.  I can't tell if it's causing any problems, but I'm so scared of everything that I won't go any faster than I am.  Up until last night I did think it was working, at least on calming me down a little.  Now, I'm just not sure, so am in a holding pattern on my dosing.  For the insomnia I have the Remeron, and the Ativan, which I will try to rotate around.  HOnestly, they both work terrific for me (fingers crossed this holds) but I dont' want to take anything.  (sorry I'm rambling, just trying to get everything down)  Meditation, which I didn't think would work but it honestly does.  The blood sugar issue... berberine.  I honestly believe this is working.  I still get anxiety when I eat, but it goes away pretty quickly.  I also only eat once or twice a day because the more i eat the worse it gets.  Gallbladder.  I kid you not, beets.  I was *shocked* when the very first time I tried them my stomach was so happy it wasn't even funny.  A couple bites of beets, or a small glass of beet juice, twice a day and everything is lovely.  Problem is, while I like beets, I do not love them, and I jsut can't eat them twice a day. Just ordered some Standard Process BetaFood, which is beets in vitamin form.  Digestion in general.  Digestive enzymes, Betaine with pepsin (which is capsule hydrochloric acid), and a little gem I found called Dr Berg's gallbladder formula.  Worked really well, but now I just use the beets.  Will still use the formula though, if I eat a big meal, for instance.  I have found nothing that works on the hot flashes.  Inferno flashes more like it.  How can a person get that hot and not burst into flames?   Stiff neck and shoulders.  I have recently started working out (an optimistic term for what I do)  I have started walking/running on the treadmill (mostly walking, only a mile), I have a short yt video I do for aerobic stuff, and then I do stretching (lots of it), both on a bolster and on a yoga wheel.  I have tendinitis in my shoulder (out of the blue), which makes it difficult to sleep since I'm a side sleeper.  Started to be both shoulders (those were miserable nights) but the stretching and working out freed up one shoulder so I at least have the one side to sleep on. Again, praise God.   Oh, here's a nice bonus.  My cholesterol is so high that my ARNP is freaking out.  Suggested statins, I declined, so she put me on the berberine (same stuff for blood sugar).  Berberine works as good or better as Metformin on blood sugar (in clinical trials) and lowers cholesterol.  Bingo!  Two for one shopping.  I'm sure there are other things that I'm attributing to menopause, but honestly I can only take so much.   Click here to view image Anyway, pleased to meet you all.  I appreciate your tolerance."

By 4.30 pm I was ready for bed ! This is no life ! I’m not waiting 3months for the BHRT to work that’ll be bloody winter and going to bed whilst it’s still light out is embarrassing. So getting my HRT prescription tomorrow . What I’ve read on here most women say it starts working right away and after pulling 2 tarot cards ( yes I’m now resigned to this) I’m going to give it a go . In this day and age when men can get Viagra and have immediate results .... WE have to wait 3 months ? My mood has lifted a little with the BHRT but I’m nowhere near normal and getting so fed up !  Any input greatly appreciated !

Feel as if I havnt slept well. Then come these feelings like adrenalin starting in my stomach. It moves up my upper body like a wave finishing in my arms. This only happens for around an hour after waking. It's the weirdest thing. Health Anxiety is a huge menopause symptom for me so like lots of you we think our symptoms are something serious.

mauiblue,2018-03-28T05:23+00:00,Work Kids Menopause,"I will start by saying that this forum of ladies has been sooo supportive and awesome. I am wondering how you all manage working full time, taking care of kids and dealing with the overwhelming ravages of menopause successfully?  Everyday i wake up and have to talk myself out of the ominous surges inside my chest, then juts soldier through the day. Im not even living sometimes, its just literally soldering, limping, managing, coping through the day. In the evening it seems to subside a bit but not much. How long can I keep this up i wonder to myself.. Perimenopause was miserable and conufsing, but entering into menopause has been much much more difficult. Complete transformation in my life.  I do not socialize anymore unless im in the public and faking it, i go to work, take care of kids as well as i can possibly, we are close so in a way its harder because they see whats happened to me, makes me even more heartbroken.  Im a single mom so its all on me, no family where we are, and no father in the picture. I am always amazed at the end of the day that i made it again. How can i be optimistic that it will end soon when it may not end soon?"
mary27278,2018-06-16T02:50+00:00,Desperate For Help!,"I'm been dealing with frequent urination, burning, irritation and discomfort for two weeks now and it is driving me up the walls. The irritation seem to be coming from the external not internal except for the uretha. I have the urge to urinate all the time and when i release it burns like crazy! At first I started only with frequent urination until I ate some cake and other sweets seem to trigger the burning, and worsen it. I've looked and looked to see where is this severe discomfort coming from. It seem to be in the tissue or skin of the outer labia, the whole outer area including the urethra. There seem to be thinning and no elastic of the labia. Sorry if this is TMI but i really dont know what to do anymore and i hope its nothing serious. I've had the irritation before on and off but never to this degree. Last time I used the estrogen cream and it helped but this time nothing seem to work. I read about atrophy, could this be it?I have tried everything from otc uti kit, it was negative, drinking cranberry juice, yeast cream and suppositories, probiotics (the cream and probiotics seem to help a bit) , biest and bhrt progesterone, soaking in baking soda, drinking baking soda, vmagic cream, etc. The yeast suppositories burned like crazy! I dont know what else to do. I have an appt to my gyn on Monday, it was scheduled on this past Monday so in the meantime, I had to endure another week of misery along with my other symptoms. I wished this on no one, because this is misery. If only I had something to knock me out to escape the misery!😭 Does anyone know anything that I can do besides whats been done already? Do you think this is serious? With the estrogen last time it helped but it was premarin and this time its BHRT. I stopped the biodentical estrogen and progesterone because I noticed the symptoms seem to worsen with the progesterone and with estrogen didnt really notice any difference with it ( bhrt) like i did last time."

Guest,2018-06-15T13:11+00:00,Changing to new gyn group and how it happened,"I've posted in some of the forum discussions about looking for a new gyn doctor and noticed that other ladies are also struggling with this.  I'd like to share a bit about my experience in case it helps anyone else. In my young adult years, I was under the care of an outstanding gyn for several years, an older man with lots of experience who was highly respected.  He passed away suddenly and I had to find someone else.  A friend recommended a woman close to my age who was accepting new patients.  It turned out that this doctor also knew my previous doctor and was taking many of his patients to help out, and she seemed compassionate, so I switched to her.  She was in a partnership at the time. Several years into seeing this second doctor, she left her partnership and went out on her own.  She was never the same after that.  I would schedule my checkups well in advance and they'd call to try to reschedule and cancel, saying that she wanted to take time off, etc., and I knew something was up.  At my last checkup with her, she displayed erratic behavior and I actually left bleeding from a routine pap test.  I never went back.  I learned later via public records that she had her license suspended as she had become addicted to painkillers.  I was too scared to go to someone else and went without gyn care for several years following. Two years ago, I had some symptoms that needed to be investigated.  I was referred by a GP to a urologist and a gyn.  The urologist was a man who knew what he was doing but had a terrible bedside manner.  He got me through what I needed from him, though.  The gyn seemed great at first and had to do surgery on me.  Unfortunately, as soon as the surgery was done, she and her staff proved to be less than supportive.  There were numerous issues, including a post-op prescription that she wrote incorrectly (this was a big mess to get fixed), paperwork for my surgery leave written incorrectly for my employer and never corrected after multiple requests to do so, and various nurses calling with lab results with different interpretations of the same tests.  They tended to call with results that they tried to interpret without her having seen the results first.  During what turned out to be my final visit with her, I tried to talk with her about my peri symptoms and she was rude and treated me like I was crazy.   Once again, I find myself without a gyn.  I am not afraid of doctors:  I've had Crohn's disease for 22 years and my GI doctor is absolutely outstanding, so I know there are people out there who care about what they do and how they do it.  I want to find a gyn doctor who will provide that level of care.  Yesterday, I received information about an OBGYN group located near where I work.  They are a comprehensive women's care group and actually provide urological and menopausal services and mammography as well.  I read some patient reviews, including one from a woman I know who is respected in our community, and they are great reviews.  I am going to give this group a try as they provide all the services I'm looking for and I do not want to go without care again.  I do not want this most recent situation to keep me from getting the care I deserve.  Maybe this time will be better.  I am trying hard to have faith that I will find a kind and trustworthy doctor.  This has been a real battle for me over many years, but I don't want to go through menopause without having this support. Thanks for listening and for all the support here.  I hope this helps someone."

So this is one thing, I had a very short span inbetween periods last month. Started May 19, lasted about 5-6 days...I was fine, nothing out of the ordinary, then started again on June 3rd! That’s the first time I’ve had that short of a cycle yet. Basically 19 days from the day I started in May, until I started again on the 3rd. Ok....so this last period, normal but shorter. Only lasted a total of like 3-4 days. Cramps weren’t that bad, and then it was gone. Now, several days after it’s over...I start feeling the weird headaches, digestion issues, and now these like “drops” of anxiety.  Basically where out of nowhere it’s like your heart drops and then goes “thump!” Once or twice and then back to normal for a bit. Then it does it again. I have a TON of experience with anxiety through my kids, family members- run rampant in my family. I didn’t have issues until a little over a year ago (when I found this forum thank god! Lol) but my anxiety attacks weren’t always these little “drops” on the roller coaster feelings, and the “thump!”.  I know I’ve heard many of you talk about this, the same symptoms. Can anyone tell me what you do or what helps you with these specific symptoms? Other than anti depressants. I don’t have insurance and don’t feel like I’m “there yet” when it comes to regular meds. Also don’t feel like popping a Xanax right now LOL!  Any tips y’all?  Hope someone’s awake, it’s almost midnight on the east coast of the U.S right now lol"
kezzabird30,2016-04-29T09:35+00:00,Contraception pill versus HRT,"So I have been having peri symptoms for about 2 years. Foggy head, fatique, painful bones, headaches, mood swings, sporadic periods, hot flushes to name but a few. I finally plucked up courage and went to the doctors last week. She did a full blood works, thyroid, liver, kidney, anemia, except hormone level. She did not do this. All came back clear apart from a slight raised throid count. She said she would test for this again in a couple of months however I said to her I could no continue with how i am feeling and please could she let me try HRT. I was very surprised with the reply as I had not even given this a thought before but I am on the pill so apparently the estrogen i am getting through the contraception pill is far far higher the low dose given in HRT and therefore she said i was better staying on what i was on. So for me that was devastation. That was it. This is my life now feeling totally horrid for the next 5 - 10 years. She then got me to complete this form... asking how many days a week i felt tearful, useless, blah blah to which i scored a high 23... showing,.... im depressed! I was so angry. I honestly felt like she believed me but all she wanted to do was prescribe me anti depressants. Of course I am depressed feeling like i do but i have suffered depression before years ago and I am convinced it is not depression. So i have come away with a box of Anti depressants i really do not want to take and probably will not take. I had them previously and one of the side effects was excessive tiredness.. so i only stayed on them one month... Just looked at the box of these one and in big bold letters it says Can cause sleepness! I struggle to get through the day as it is and end up having snooze in my car at lunch time. I just feel totally deflated today. Like no one believes me and that i have to be like i am now until full blown menpause. I had no idea that being on the pill was stronger than taking HRT or am i just being blagged off? Am hoping some of you lovely ladies have some advice on how to raise my energy levels and how to get rid of my foggy head. i cannot function at work and am making so many mistakes. I have been taking vitamin supplements for over 6 months, calcium, magnessium, Vit b comples, Vit B6, Vit D3, Vit c and zinc plus macafem herbal rememdy. Im 42 years of age and feel like i have age in the last year. I never looked my age but not i look so much older. I should say they my mum has Rheumatoid arthritus and osteoporis both caused by not being on HRT at the menopause and I am so worried i will get this as it is hereditory. This past few months my elbows hurt when i rest on desk, my fingers are sore and burning and yet she said there was no signs of inflamation in my bloods so i am glad that is one good thing as means i do not have RA but what are these pains? Sorry for the long post. x"
mary27278,2018-06-12T00:52+00:00,Frequent Urination,"I have been urinating like crazy for almost 2 weeks. As soon as i drink water which is the only thing i drink, it comes right out. It comes out like a water fountain and I'm wondering where is all this water coming from. It is very irritated, burns and discomfort down to the point of crying sometimes. It is not inside but around the private area, more on the labia and urethra. The urethra looks a bit inflamed and feel of pressure in the urethra , like urine is always there even after using it . I also feel constipated and bloated, it seem worse during this time. But what is weird , i rarely have to get up during the night to urinate. I have an appt to Gyn on next week but in the meantime im wondering if anyone experienced this? By the way, i had the same problem 4 months ago and it wasnt a uti, yeast, etc. But i was told that it was from lack of estrogen. Though, last time it was not to this extreme. This is awful this time! was given estrogen cream and it seem to help, this time seem different , I am using the Biest cream but no results yet. Ive only used it 2days so far. One other thing, when i eat certain foods such as with sugar in it , it triggers the burning also. This is really getting to me...."

I have been suffering with hot flashes and night sweats along with joint pain pretty consistently. But I was determined not to go the HRT route mostly because I always react oddly to meds, plus I just thought it was delaying what would have to happen eventually unless you stay on it for the rest of your life.  This week I started with a new symptom that may be the deal breaker. I’m getting itchy skin accompanied by a hive type rash on my face. It is really annoying and uncomfortable! It feels like my face is turning into rhino hide!  I’m currently taking black cohosh, a daily vitamin, Magnesium and fish oils.  So am I misunderstanding how one uses HRT?"

But I'm slipping right back into it now...and I cannot do that again! My husband told me yesterday that if something doesn't change we won't last.  I CAN'T CHANGE IT!! With all the times he has broken my heart in the past 25 years by never being there...but he is not willing to go through this trip with me again.  I think it is because he cannot stand being criticized ... and well, these days I am critical.  I am having a hard time even liking him...and I *know* it's hormones.  But i can't stop. I am back to the brain fog...not being able to get anything done at home.  Not happy at home.  Last week I hooked up my camper and left for a week to ""get out of his hair""  I told him.  But I can't get out of my own!!! And I will never make it on my own...financially or otherwise.  I have always been a stay at home wife.  There is no possible way I can find a job in this state of mind...I can't even get done the things i already know how to do!  never mind trying to learn anything new. The only thing I can think of is avoiding home so that *he* doesn't get bitched at.  So that *he* doesn't get upset with me.  If I am not here when he is, he won't get in trouble right?

I am currently on 100 mg Prometrium and 2 mg Estradial.  I just started this a week ago. I have one ovary and I do have my uterus. I have severe vaginal dryness still. Every time I get aroused, wipe after using the bathroom, or even towel off or even touch the vaginal area it itches and tingles soooo bad that it gives me a panic attack. It is not an infection as there is zero smell and I have been checked. It is weird because it almost feels good like I am getting aroused.  I tried the Estrace cream and I noticed it causes itching but it isn't something in the Estrace because the pills do it too. Does anyone know if it is a lack of Estrogen? A lack of something else? I cannot take it anymore. It is worse at night. It feels almost like when you go out in the snow or get very cold and then come into a warm house and everything starts to tingle. Is it the nerves waking up after being dead so long? It is so nerve wracking! I have tried putting coconut oil there and it doesn't help and just wiping it on causes it to itch severely. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Other symptoms I have is digestive issues, bloating, depression, cysts on my ovary that is left, fluid retention. I noticed last night as soon as I took the hormones that itching and tingling came on worse. Tonight I am going to take the Estradial first and wait a half hour and then the Prometrium to see if I can tell which one it is."

I've had 2 D&C's done (2010 and 2016),  2 Hysteroscopies Endometrial Ablation (2010 which distorted the uterus) Uterine Prolapse in my late 30's 6 Biopsies (latest May/2018) Too Many ultrasounds to count now Polypectomy (2010 but, none found with hysteroscopy in 2016) Endometrial Hyperplasia NO atypia I have tried 5.5 months of Provera at 10 mg (landing me in an ER because of HEAVY bleeding while on it steadily) 10 mg of Provera CYCLICALLY for a year (still going back to Hyperplasia NO atypia Mirena IUD for 3.5 months that caused bleeding and cramping so badly that I was taking Advil day and night and Aura Migraines that the manufacturer and ER docs said to ""get it out NOW""...which I did have done.  Went right onto Prometrium 100 mg vaginally for nearly a month (constant bleeding and cramping) Then, the gynaecologist (I've had 3 of them as they passed me to one another) said to come off of everything.  I did.  No bleeding for about 8 months.   Now, I am bleeding steadily, usually late day but can be anytime.  I've had my blood tested NO anemia.  Biopsy pathology came back as Simple Hyperplasia NO atypia again.   My FSH is 16.8 to 17 pmol/L and stays there, not going up.  Estradiol is 170 (Canadian Value but, that's down from 198 Canadian Value) I cannot, no matter how often or what I've tried, get ahold of my gynaecologist!  I'm SO angry at this!!!! I have signed papers for a hysterectomy out of pure frustration but, NO date has been set and she said it could be ""January to March of NEXT year"" before it's done.   I have prescriptions for 2.5 mg of Provera and 100 mg of Prometrium but, frankly...I'm TERRIFIED of trying anything else right now because it makes things WORSE and I've tried it all before with horrendous side effects for me, personally. I've approached my family doc and she said ""don't do anything"" but, ""doesn't know what to tell me"" and will not refer me to another gyn now.   What would YOU do?  Any suggestions would help as I am a nervous wreck in spite of all of the testings and can't get in touch with my current gynaecologist.  Would you try the same things over again or let it be now?"

Guest,2018-06-03T20:01+00:00,Has anyone had jaw ache/soreness?,"Yesterday, I noticed that my jaw was sore when I began to eat lunch.  I wasn’t eating anything tough or hard to chew.  It had been totally fine at breakfast.  Today, it is still sore but not quite as much.  I do not see any swelling or signs of tooth infection, abscess, etc., no fever or anything like that.  However, it is uncomfortable to chew.  I am considering putting in a call to my dentist.  The symptoms sound very much like TMJ.  Has anyone else had anything like this?"

cristen75330,2018-06-06T15:14+00:00,My doctor says it's not perimenopause...,"Hi all,  I'm 32 and have been having all the typical symptoms of perimenopause. I've been to my doctor several times in the last year, and been treated for different things, none of which was effective.  On my last visit, I explained that I thought I may be in perimenopause, and she agreed that my symptoms are consistent with it, but she said at my age it wouldn't be a menopause thing, it would be (I believe) early ovarian failure.  She's very dedicated to helping me figure out for sure what's been going on, and she ordered a full hormone lab work-up.  The clinic called me this morning to say my results are in, and that they want me to see another doctor to discuss them.  If my results were all normal, wouldn't they say so over the phone? Every other test I've had has come back normal and that's how it worked. So now I'm getting worried, I don't know anything about ovarian failure and I don't know what else they even could have found in my labs.  This may not be the best place to post this, but I was hoping maybe someone here has gone through something similar or knows anything more about this kind of thing?"
keith77969,2018-06-02T18:53+00:00,"My Wife seems to despise me, yet I haven't changed much.","My wife is a professional, I am a retired professional 10 years her senior. She is still active professionally for a few more years. We have three young children between 9 and 12. She works from home 3 days a week via the telephone and 1 day as an in house Corporate Doctor 10 miles away. We have a large property with over an acre of garden and an acre of just mowed grass. I hand mow the grass every week, cook every meal for our family, do all the shopping and help cleaning the house once a week by mopping all the floors (Large tiled kitchen, two tiled bathrooms and large sun room). My wife now seems to be nearly overwhelmed at times with the laundry (can you imagine three young boys school uniforms?)..I wear the same clothes 3 days then change except on the day after I cut grass. I change all the beds with her, mop the house, empty all the trash cans, carrry all the soiled linen down and clean the toilets. The point is, I never know when she comes home whether I am going to be fighting for my family or having a great evening. She seems at odds with me suddenly this year despie no major changes occuring. I do not go out drinking, I don't drink at all, I have no male friends outside of the house except neighbors though before I married I was quite gregarious. I do not cheat, never cheated and do not gamble. I am now starting to feel all that sacrifice was wasted in a sense and she thinks me less of a man because of my staid, stay at home predicatblility...OR....is there something else going on here that may account for this years change? We have a good sex life except during the periods after these breakdowns between us, and you are only hearing one side of this, so take that into account. She thinks me ""lazy and unappreciative of all she does"" regardless of what I do or say...she is threating breaking apart our family during these episodes that for the life of me can be triggered by something as simple as her being tired and returing home and finding me in a good mood. I am at my wits end."

I have tried pressing them on for many minutes, heating the area to get them to stick, covering them... bla, bla, bla but nope! They come off in the shower every time (even very quick showers!). My aches, tiredness and total forgetfulness has returned as I don't think I'm now receiving the correct amount of hormones through the patch coming off and no period this month on HRT so obviously this is the case, (my periods came back when I started HRT). So, my Heath professional is ringing today and I just want to ask you guys - has anyone tried alternative progesterone alongside oestrogen patches?  Previous to me using Femseven, Evorel patches stuck like a dream but am allergic to the progesterone in them... I thought maybe I'd ask for Evorel brand oestrogen patches and then an alternative progesterone somehow? The clot worry is why I use patches but I've heard the risk is lower for progesterone causing clots anyway (it's the oestrogen factor that is the main clot risk??).  Eeeeeek! A girl could go mad trying to work alternatives! Thank you in advance... I'm 46 and so fed up of trying to stay on top as without HRT my body aches and brainfog is just unbearable. 😩 Just want my old carefree pre-menopause life back... 😢 Have a good day all.  AJ. x"

bev27429,2018-06-03T22:33+00:00,Feeling So Depressed,"I had thought that I was improving mood-wise, and I believed that my mind was finally healing from this perimenopausal, hormonal havoc, but, in the last few weeks, my mood has worsened dramatically. Most of the day, I am barraged by negative thoughts and feel deeply depressed, even though I continue on with all of my activities, including full time work. I try to distract myself in any way that I can, but my hormones just seem so much more powerful than anything that I can do to counteract them. At my psychiatrist's suggestion, I have started on a course of St. John's Wort, which he indicated has clinical evidence to support its efficacy in treating depression. I am almost 50, and my periods are close together and generally very light. I have lots of painful cramping and bloating, so I know that my system is totally out of whack. I just pray that this will soon be over, as it is so difficult to keep going when you feel like this. I am not considering HRT, as bioidentical progesterone worsened my depression when I took it, and I can't take unopposed estrogen, due to the health risks. Also, I don't want to play around with my already unstable hormones. I would love to hear what has worked for other women or from women who have ""made it to the other side"". Thanks for reading. May we all get through this time."

Guest,2018-06-03T20:22+00:00,Living single with peri is hard,"Anyone else out there alone?  I’m not married and have no children.  Peri makes me feel so lonely, especially when something is wrong.  My parents, sister, and nephews live only 10-15 minutes from me, but it seems farther.  I used to be so independent and now just feel so alone and scared.  I feel bad having to rely on them when something is wrong and sometimes I just don’t tell them.  Unfortunately, that makes me feel more isolated.  In the last two years, they’ve seen me through a surgery and several doctors appointments. I also have Crohn’s disease.  I don’t know if I can keep living alone.  It definitely feels better to have company, especially when the panic and anxiety are bad.  My mom went through a few years before her hysterectomy when she absolutely could not be alone, so I know she understands that aspect.  Would love to hear from others in this situation to support each other. 🌸"

BugglyBot,2018-06-03T16:03+00:00,Endless Fear And Anxiety,"I know you wonderful ladies have heard this countless times but I really have had enough of feeling this way. My periods have been hit and miss for a while. My Mirena Coil is due to be replaced next year and I've been using Vagifem pessaries for a few years, twice a week. Several months ago, I started getting pains in the ovary region that would be followed eventually by a short period. I wouldn't bleed much but it would go on for about two weeks.  A few months ago, I started with the tender breast feeling that I used to get before a period, along with a tightness with breathing. These symptoms I've had before so I recognised them as pre-menstrual. I thought..""here we go"". A few days later, I'd bleed a little for again up to two weeks. Now, days after finishing, the breast tenderness comes back, along with a little backache at the bottom of my back. This has happened yet again and I've slightly bled until today when it's a lot more.  I'm absolutely terrified something serious is wrong. Everyday, all day, it's on my mind. I get angry when I go to the toilet and the fear is unbelievable. I'm so scared I don't even know how I'll get to the doctors to discuss this. I worry about my cervix, womb and ovaries. The anxiety is too much. I have a loving and very supportive husband and I'm sick of him having to hear me worry over this so I shut down sometimes. Everyone has everyday worries and problems to deal with and this is overriding my life.  I refuse to Google anything as that would physically and mentally make me feel worse than I do already. I am terrified all the time and I can't take much more of this. I know I sound dramatic here but I don't know where to turn and what to believe. Everything ends with me in the worst case scenario because I'm so sure that I have something that terrible. I don't know what to do anymore. Is this normal? Does anyone else feel or has felt this way? I'm at a complete loss. I'm so down and fed up. I could have had a Hysterectomy years ago but I chose not to thankfully as our third son was born when I was 34. The Mirena Coil has worked wonders for me but I'm so scared that now my fertility is shutting down, it's going to do something frightening to me. For whoever has gotten this far, thank you for reading. I just don't want to have to worry about this anymore. I just want to mentally be able to function without this hanging over me all of the time."

Recently o found out that I was on too high of a dude of Synthroid. I'm also 53 and blood week proves that I'm in full blown menopause. I have a dilemma.... My husband who is a doctor and one of his partners is my doctor and the three of us have agreed that I should wait to see if the lower dose of Synthroid calms my anxiety (might see a difference in another 2-4 weeks) and that I should stay on the 75 mg of Effexor XR.Meanwhile after researching menopause, serotonin decreases during this time as well.... My anxiety is consistently low right now, but always present. Has ANYONE experienced any of this at the same time? I'm just tired of living like this. Every day is a struggle, but bearable. Uggg"

jacqueline59683,2018-05-28T18:16+00:00,Going crazy at 55! But still have my periods,"I've been reading some comments on the forums and need reassurance.  I've never suffered from depression or anxiety until I was 51 years old.  At which time I though i was going crazy and visited all of my docs, my gynecologist prescribed lexapro and it did help. After about 2 years I felt better and got off of it and was fine for 3 years, at least any depression or anxiety was manageable and I hated the side effects- weight gain and lower sex drive- to an already diminished sex drive.  Now at 55.5 on my last cycle I woke up nauseous, depressed which fueled anxiety- for the last month and a half I have been miserable.  I used to sleep great (and I miss it) my sleep is terrible almost wake up hourly, vivid dreams, hot and then cold.  I've stopped drinking diet sodas ( addicted and miss it so much even after 1.5 months) and trying to quit sugar.  I started St. John's wort- ( second bottle half done) I don't see too much change...I mean I want my old self back.  I have better days today its terrible. I feel my body is breaking apart- constipated, depressed, anxious, tinnitus, dizzy sometimes- the one constant is my period , although the last one was 10 days long and light...so maybe the end is near.  I had ob/gyn ultrasound and waiting for those results...no one I know has gone through menopause with all of the symptoms I have.  HELP my doctor mentioned Paxil instead of Lexapro if the depression continues.  Any thoughts are greatly appreciated...as I feel I'm going crazy Jackie"

Started Prometrium 100 mg oral last week and no side effects really, have felt more 'even steven' emotionally, so that is good but having some pretty bad stomach cramps. I thought the cramps were due to some meat we cooked that was two days old, but it smelled fine when I cooked it. But I first noticed the cramp after I sampled it. I had eaten a HoHo (junk food) at the same time, which I don't normally eat a lot of, too. Later we had the meat for dinner, and later I had some vodka with grape juice. If the cramping was due to the meat, or junk food, or vodka, why would I still be having cramps three days later? My husband didn't get any cramps after eating the meat. If it's the Prometrium causing the cramps, I'm wondering if the pill can be inserted vaginally? It's a little orange, round pill. I've heard of women getting upset stomach on Prometrium and was thankful I wasn't really having any symptoms, then this cramping started. I also just started Vivelle, the estrogen patch, and have high hopes for that."
Guest,2018-05-29T17:32+00:00,Simple Endometrial Hyperplasia w/o Atypia - looking for advise on treatment options,"I recently went through a surgery to remove 10 uterine fibroid tumors that were of substantial size.  During this surgery the doctor performed a D&C to make sure nothing else was going on.  The tests came back positive for 'simple endometrial hyperplasia without atypia'.  She is starting me on medroxyprogesterone - 20 MG per day (2- 10 MG pills).  I am 51 years old, still going through menopause but really want to go through menopause naturally and not via a hysterectomy. First question is to see if someone has done this therapy and found it to be effective.  Is this a better option than an IUD? Secondly is to see if someone has had the same treatment before and if you feel it is safe.  You read so many things out there about potential side effects and how this can cause heart disease, blood clots - but is this more over an extended period of time?  Any feedback on the side effects as well would be appreciated.  I am not a big fan of taking medicine nor did I ever want to do any type of hormone replacement therapy but this option seems to be the best to get rid of this potential type of cancer.  Would an IUD produce the same results without the many side effects? Finally, there are a few conflicting regiments out there - some say to take this orally for 15 days and then go off it for 15 days, some say to take it straight until 3 months when you get tested again.  Any input on this would be greatly appreciated as I am a bit skeptical on what to do.  Thanks Thanks and appreciate any feedback you can offer"

He's not a fan of HRT in any fashion.   I'm 62 and have had absolutely no issues with them but was going to comply with My Drs wishes so had the dosage cut in half. Used half dose (estrogen/testerone cream along with progesterone capsules at night) for 4 months. Then tried going every second day on my own. That was horrible. My original dr who prescribed the bio identical son retired so I found a new one for another opinion. She explained why my regular dr wanted me off hormones and why it wasn't necessary. Long story short I'm back on them. She increased my dosage back to what it was and also added DHEA into the mix. HERE is the issue! Been on these now for 3 weeks and I have discharge. I have not seen a period in over 6 years so boy oh boy am I wondering what's going on! I'm guessing it's the increase in the prescription. Anyone else have this experience?

Now I never really had pms except really for being grumpy at times but now I’m so aware of everything I feel it drives me mad cause I’m like what’s wrong with me why am I emotional why am I anxious tired stressed. I have to say I’m more sensative too to little things that wouldn’t have phased me before. I  guess I should note I am a stay at home mom and I work from home and my spouse doesnt her Home till 830 every night so you know how that goes no time together don’t have much support except for mom and that is rare lol!

Prior to it my boobs hurt then for 5-6 days I bled. I went for a pap 10 days ago mentioned it and nothing. Then the NP called me to let me know she consulted with others in her clinic, none of whom are ob/gyns, and they said the standard medical diagnosis is that this is cancer and the only way to rule it out is to subject myself to a vaginal U/S and a endometrial biopsy. I'm refusing. Think they're over reacting. My white blood count was fine because they took some blood for my annual. Anyhow, I just don't want to do an invasive procedure like that when I feel completely fine. I spotted last month April 2018. If I were to get one it'd be in the next week and I feel totally fine, no achy boobs, cravings or cramping. Would you get a biopsy? What if I made a mistake and it's been 13 most since my last period? I don't think so but threw the calendar from last year out.

Guest,2018-05-23T23:36+00:00,Slowing down for self-care in peri,"I’m about 4 years into peri, have had Crohn’s disease for 22 years, and have had bladder issues for about two years.  Everything I’ve been told by doctors for all three points to eating healthy foods, getting help for anxiety, and keeping up with my medical checkups.  I have struggled with all of it for so long, thinking I could just do as I wanted and things would fall into place.  But nothing is getting better by my doing that, of course.  I’ve begun to realize that my menopausal journey is trying to tell me that I must slow down.  Sugary and caffeinated foods upset my body now.  Rushing about just makes me anxious.  Not getting enough sleep makes it harder to get through the day.  Finding good doctors who really listen is of utmost importance. I’m starting a self-care journal for keeping track of my health, diet and exercise as well as doctor visits and results.  The biggest issue for me is having a sense of control in a phase of life where so much is unpredictable.  So many people have told me to do the best I can possibly do with self-care now.  I see as I continue to struggle that good advice and counsel only help if I follow them.   If anyone else journals or follows a specific self-care plan, I would love to hear from you.  I am serious about this because I have let a lot of things fall apart in my life and I know I can’t afford to give up on my health.  It has come down to understanding that I’m not young anymore and can’t get away with just doing whatever I want because it’s taking a serious toll on my mind and body."

Guest,2018-05-21T18:25+00:00,Thickened uterine lining,"Hi, just came back from having a vaginal u/s which showed my uterine lining is .9cm, and being I just finished a period, it should've been thinner. The doctor said she wants to do a biopsy. After googling (yes, I googled!) I see it can also be due to having no progesterone and estrogen dominant. I know I've been estrogen dominant for a long time. So I'm trying to decide whether I should do the biopsy for peace of mind, or just forget it. I've had so many tests, I just feel worn out. But then I think, what if it is something? Good thing is I've been tested to the moon and back, I would think if it's some late stage cancer it would've showed up somewhere. The tech couldn't even find my left ovary, guess it has shrunk. Gosh, it just seems like there is always something to worry about.  I know I've seen some of you talking about having the biopsy, can you tell me what happened, what I can expect (painful, down time?), and what your results were??? Thank you!  XO"

teri76755,2018-05-21T00:20+00:00,Can I blame menopause?,"I’ve been chasing a few seemingly unconnected symptoms for a few years. I’m 18 months post menopause. Symptoms include heart palpitations & SVT, chest pain, GERD/upper abdominal pain, back and joint.  I’ve had thorough cardiac testing and my heart is structurally normal. Normal abdominal ultrasounds. Gall bladder was removed last year after a HIDA scan found my GB was extremely overactive. That improved the chest pain some. When I got to the one year mark after my last period, I started dealing with extreme anxiety. Panic attacks have been a weekly occurrence. Add to that occasional dizziness and headaches and just a brain fog kind of feeling. No night sweats or hot flashes, so I didn’t immediately think of menopause. I’m wondering though if my symptoms are typical of peri- and post-menopause. I know my doctors are tired of me!!"

I feel like crawling under a rock and coming out when it is all over.  I can start to feel better, normal even, and then I just come crashing down, only to start the whole cycle over again. Each time, I hope that it is the last time. This has been going on for ten months, and it is so difficult to bear, even though I recognize that I must accept my situation, do the best that I can, and wait for it to be over. It's just so hard to feel like an emotional zombie. I don't ever make plans right now, as I never know how I am going to feel from moment to moment. I can feel normal, then euphoric, then filled with dread, then deeply depressed, sometimes in the span of hours. I know that it is time that will fix this, but it is so difficult to stay patient, continue on, and keep hope going.

I just let me boyfriend know that I won't be able to go with him and his cycling club on a four day cycling trip because I just can't predict how I am going to feel from one moment to the next. I am finding it excruciating to live like this. Yesterday, I had a lovely day where I felt calm, confident, and happy. Today, I am feeling down, hopeless, guilty, and frustrated. I know that I am doing the absolute best that I can with incredibly challenging circumstances, but I still feel like I am disappointing people around me. My boyfriend is incredibly supportive, and has told me that he will stand by my side no matter what, but I do know that it is so hard for him to truly conceive what is going on with me psychologically. I can barely conceive it myself! When I feel down, everything seems bleak. At these times, I doubt everything, seem to gang up on myself, and am filled with negative thinking. Then, without doing anything, the depressioncan just lift, and I then feel optimistic, excited, and in control of my life. All of these symptoms started for me about eight months ago. I have had crying and screaming jags (thankfully usually when I am alone), feelings of deep depression, anxiety, an inability to cope, and horrible, scary thoughts. It's just so difficult not to be able to control my emotions. I am focusing on staying present, accepting that this is hormones, and reassuring myself that this is a temporary phase.  I just feel like I have lost myself, and I feel scared. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."

I’ve spent the last year feeling like I’m falling apart- heart palpitations, muscle spasms, headaches, acne, insomnia, anxiety, bleeding gums, and so much more- and I’ve been to different doctors and they all assured me I’m fine after heart monitors and thyroid tests and honestly it was extremely frustrating. I don’t FEEL fine, I feel weird and tired and cranky and I switch between wanting to hug everyone and wanting to yell at them at the drop of a hat.  I didn’t know about perimenopause until yesterday; I’m 32, menopause was pretty far from my mind. But after an extremely rough round of PMS and weeks of my face resembling a pepperoni pizza (when I’ve never had acne in my life), along with all the symptoms I mentioned above, I’d had it. I’m so tired of wondering if the docs missed something, tired of the anxiety and the racing heart and the weird pains for no apparent reason. So I started digging and when I read through the symptoms of perimenopause, it just clicked.  I honestly feel hugely relieved to know what’s been going on with me, but I’m a little concerned that it started right after I turned 32. Everything I’ve read so far says 35 is about the earliest it usually starts.  Anyone else under 35 here experiencing perimenopause? And did it seem to come on out of nowhere?"

brandon,2018-05-11T20:23+00:00,Losing My Wife Who Is My BFF,"Hi all, Most of the letters on this forum are from women, which is to be expected.  I regularly read these interesting accounts because they are informative, honest, help me to support my wife and consider views from a different perspective.   I am a married man in my early fifties and my wife is of a similar age.  We both are healthy as we exercise 6 days per week and try to eat well. My wife has been going through the surgical menopause for the last six years.  She is now finally taking the correct HRT and she is doing well.  I have always considered myself an easy going person and not averse to doing any role in the house.  In fact, I am better at cooking and housework than D.I.Y (I know my limits). My wife and I have been married for 10 years, we do not have any children due to medical issues.  Until recently I considered my wife to be my best friend.  I am not naïve to believe that she tells me everything but if I was going to share my deepest darkest secret then she would be the only one I would tell. In the last six years, I feel as though I have lost my BFF, lover and my rock. I am heartbroken and as I type this I have a mixture of emotions ranging from despair, mourning, betrayal (for writing this letter), frustration, anger, sorrow and love. I accept we all change over time for various reasons but what I had hoped wouldn’t change would be the love, intimacy and consideration for the other’s feelings. Currently, my wife and I are very distant both emotionally and physically.  Over the years I have supported my wife through the menopause.  I have accompanied her to the majority of the medical appointments, I have read (and continue to read) menopausal literature, I have attended menopausal seminars, I have championed and raised menopausal adjustments in the workplace, I try to be understanding and tolerant about the symptoms and effects of the menopause (I’ve learnt to be quiet to avoid arguments and accept unusual and irrational behaviour) and I try not to take things to heart (but sometimes that is too difficult). I love my wife and marrying her was one of the best decisions that I have ever made.  I am still in love with my wife and I really fancy her.  I give her genuine compliments and I have learnt to be tactful about her insecurities and encourage her to see herself as I and many other people do.  I am not perfect and I can be stubborn, miserable and on a few occasions childish often retreating to my “man cave”.  But even when I’m annoyed with my wife, one of her smiles can sometimes cause me to melt. I honestly believe that my wife loves me but we are more like friends who happen to live in the same house. My wife’s reduced libido has seriously affected our intimacy and I am regularly rejected even when I just want a cuddle and I make it clear that I won’t try to have sex.  This has seriously affected my confidence in all aspects of my life, and I am now at a point where I won’t instigate contact through fear of rejection.  The spark in our marriage has gone.  I have tried to create excitement by arranging date nights, being sympathetic to her needs, arranging weekend breaks, taking as much stress off her as possible and just listening.  However, this does not seem to work.  I feel like my wife is very negative about life in general. Very rarely do I hear her say anything positive about her work, colleagues or other aspects of her life.  She seems to be very pessimistic about everything and I am the complete opposite.  I always look for positives, I don’t take myself seriously and I love laughing and making my wife laugh.  We don’t seem to laugh a lot anymore well at least not in each other’s company. I have spoken to my wife about the way I feel and the way we have become.  My wife states that she feels distant as well and is not the same person since the hysterectomy.  She no longer feels like a real woman. Following these honest and candid conversations, our relationship improves but after a short while it quickly reverts back to how it was.  I now fill my spare time with hobbies and I no longer try as much as I used to make our relationship work.  A part of me believes this is what my wife really wants despite telling me she is so in love with me and could not see her life without me.  She seems oblivious or unconcerned that our marriage is suffering and that I am in a lot of pain. So my question to the ladies and men on this forum is, do you recognise the above scenario and what are your words of advice?  Please be candid, over the last six years I have built up a very thick skin.  So if I need to “man up” then please say.  I recognise my happiness is my responsibility and not dependant on anyone else. I don’t expect my marriage to be one continuous honeymoon.  I just want to feel wanted, desired, respected and loved.  I don’t need to be put first on every occasion but I want to be considered. I don’t want to be the centre of anyone’s universe but I think our marriage should be most of the time.  I don’t want massive acts of affection, a small gesture or look will suffice."

vanessa60513,2018-05-10T19:21+00:00,Menopausal Flatulance,"Hi folks, I started the menopause at the age of 36 but wasn't taken seriously until I was 42 when i was told by a female gp after examining me that i was on the full blown menopause. I already knew this but was given the HRT which helped with the hot flushes and mood swings. Prior to the HRT being prescribed I was an emotional wreck but thankfully the HRT has helped to control that too thank god. These past few years I have since developed the most embarrassing problem and that is the terrible amount of gas that absolutely reeks. Everyone in this household are forever running around with the air freshener because it really is bad. When I say bad i mean really bad. Sometimes the gas is so loud when i release it and then other times its silent but either way its still embarrassing. I have altered my diet and don't eat onions or garlic but still no improvement. Sometimes it settles down a bit for a short while but then it returns. I was just wondering if anyone else has the same problem and if anyone knows of something that i can buy OTC. Many thanks"

Also tummy troubles?,"I've already been to a ENT and all is well(I though an inner problem may be causing the balance issues), but sometimes I'll be walking and then I just feel like I'm leaning or walking crooked. I've had acid reflux since my 20's and it's been fine until this past week. Of course when the heartburn started I thought about my heart of course. It just seem like you go from one symptom to another and your mind goes to the worse case scenario. health anxiety is the worse. Then some symptoms go away and come back, some go and stay gone. It's a rollercoaster!!! I'm on meds for the acid reflux but the doctors say it's not unusual to have ""breakthrough heartburn"". Last week, I was great, felt great, good mood. This week my tummy is messed up, had a complete meltdown Tuesday after I got home from work and just cried and cried. Menopause is not for the faint of heart."

I got to say that the first 10 days on it I was blissful and carefree. I felt normal again. But now I’m finding in the mornings I have depression  not too bad but still I can cope. My anxiety is better also, but this pit in my stomach I’m hoping is short term until the progesterone takes its full effect or if it does. I never really had this feeling much before taking it.  What do you ladies think? I feel that I want to be off of everything. I’m 52 I still have my monthly and I just don’t know what to do. I’ve been on here a few times and I feel like a broken record.

DaisyDaze,2018-04-05T11:37+00:00,Is it menopause or aging?,"Hi, I've been a member for over a year and have been reading many of the discussions. I am wondering if menopause really has 200+ symptoms, or if some of it is just age. Or are people calling aging menopause? The reason I question a lot of this is that I had so many of the symptoms before menopause, especially during child-bearing years. Another thought is that aging men also have similar symptoms; hence making me think some things are simply age related. Some of the things I've learned aging men have: headaches, pain between shoulder blades, back aches, muscle aches in general, tiredness, low energy, depression, mood swings, edginess, eye aches, vision problems, memory problems (especially, ""what was I gonna do/why did I come in this room""?), fuzzy head, ear pain, itchy skin, thinning hair, UTI's, bowel problems, etc. I can go on and on, but the question is: ""Is it menopause (hormone related) or just aging?"" Or do men go through hormone changes also?"

To be honest, I am anxious about that as it is a sign of aging I have read that white hair is a symptom of hypothyroidism or other autoimmune disorders. I think in my case hormonal factors paly a huge role to this. I have checked my thyroid and it was normal Have you noticed an increase of white hair during peri?"

mary27278,2018-05-08T14:28+00:00,Feeling Alone,"Hi everyone , yesterday i met with my dr. who suppose to be a menopause specialist. We went over my latest bloodwork. I left out feeling more distraught then when i came in. He actually told me and i quote his words"" you know I have been doing this for a very long time but i have never seen anyone quite like this, you are a very unique case"" . He was referring to my bloodwork and symptoms and many of the things im given doesnt help. He goes on to say that he has never seen anyone estrogen shoot up from less than 15 to 443. I told him maybe it could be from the vagina estrogen cream because it has happened before. He says could be but he has never seen the cream shoot it up that much. I am feeling so along and worn out. Im starting to really worry, my stomach keeps bloating, shortness of breath, etc. I mentioned to him about the bloating so he checked it out and listened to it and said i was full of gas. My appetite is leaving ..i am getting into a depression state. To make matters worse, i talked to a friend later after doctor visit and she tells me that she has never seen anyone go through all of that with menopause. It makes me feel so so along....My dr. really doesnt know what to do , he has narrowed it down to it being my adrenals. As i told him what another dr. i talked to thinks it is, and i also brought the book that this doctor has written. Then telling him about my past being treated for pcos and insulin resistance. Instead of my having adrenal fatigue , he thinks mine is adrenal dominance. He decided to give me meds to suppress my adrenals.

I am now 52 this month and haven't had a period in 5 months. My problem is that right before I am suppose to have a period my anxiety sky rockets. Last about 10 days.

alibobs123,2018-04-20T06:14+00:00,Help! I’m 48 and I feel like I’m losing my mind!,I’m 48 and I’ve been told by my doc that I’m on my peri menapause.  I am a quiet person don’t really go out these days with friends etc I find I enjoy my own company. I have been married for 15 years and been together for 19 I love him so much and we have 2 children my daughter is 24 with my grandson on the way and my son is 17. I have this immense fear that I’m going to lose my husband and that he is having an affair with one of my old friends. I have been checking his phone constantly and have accused him of not being in work and being with her. My kids tell me he wouldn’t ever do that but I fear now that I might drive him to it. I am so suspicious thinking my husband is up to something when he goes out in the car I want to follow him I’ve even though about getting a tracker for his car. It’s killing me inside I feel so nervous and feelings of panic and dread and I can’t think straight. Last year I was diagnosed with a cyst on my pituritury gland which controls hormones and I feel that this may contribute to these feelings. Please can anybody advise or suggest something that will help? I need to be me again!

mary27278,2018-05-09T10:45+00:00,Any suggestions on this??,"Last year in March I started having severe perimenopause symptoms. It started with my digestion, bloating, constipation, unable to eat, etc. I had an colonoscopy done later that month, 3/31 to be exact. My dr. said that i had gastritis, gerd, and hiatal hernia and my colon was a bit twisted which made the procedure longer than normal. She had to untwist it. Though my stomach felt as if it was really heavy on my right side. It was very uncomfortable to sleep on this side. Any loo, the very next day when i woke up all my symptoms were gone, and i got my period also. Dont know if symptoms left because of period or because of the procedure that was done. It was ok briefly and symptoms returned after period. Later in June had a cat scan done and was told that my intestine was impacted and leaning to the side. Now, lately ive been having lots of bloating, stomach is full of gas ( doctor said this week) , bowels move not too great. But, im wondering if my digestion issues are contributing to these ongoing symptoms or could this just be perimenopause or both??"

I feel so impaired with anxiety and depression that it is so hard to lead a ""normal"" life. I make plans to do things, such as an upcoming group cycling trip, but then I worry about how I am going to feel and how I am going to cope with being around other people, especially if I don't feel like myself. I am a strong person, who used to have such confidence and optimism. Sometimes, I feel like a shell of my former self. Usually, I just push myself to keep going, but then I eventually end up breaking down emotionally, because the stress just becomes too much. I feel so frustrated, and I long to return to the life that I had. Sometimes, it is hard to keep hope alive, though. Any thoughts?"
Guest,2018-05-03T22:14+00:00,"Urinary issues, changing doctors, moving forward","The results of my urinalysis from a week ago came back showing infection.  I finished the 7-day antibiotic today.  This afternoon, I missed a call from the gyn while working and they’d already left when I tried to call back.  I’d already seen the results online 3 days ago and don’t suspect that they’re going to tell me anything new, but I left voicemail for the nurse to call me tomorrow when she’s back.  They tend to be slow to call back.  Anyway, I have wondered for a while now if I might have interstitial cystitis.  I’ve received a referral to a new gyn and am also getting information about urologists.  The gyn is an older male doctor whom my sister recommended, which is very reassuring.  She spoke highly of his communication style and overall manner.  So I am moving forward with getting a new care team in place and feel optimistic about it.  I also am checking on a service I can access for help with the anxiety.  It is good to be taking these steps.   Has anyone else dealt with urinary issues and peri?  I’d never had a UTI until 2 years ago and now have had this one.  I’ve had occasional frequency/urgency issues this last year, but tests did not show infection.  This is why I wonder about having IC."

Guest,2016-04-20T06:53+00:00,My experience w/laparoscopy & Hysteroscopy - 2 weeks post-op,"I want to say thanks again for everyone's support.  My recovery is going well.  I've received a few requests to share about my experience to help others who have surgery coming up; some of this advice was offered to me before my surgery and really helped.  Your experience may be different but will hopefully go well! Some tips/thoughts: 1 - Get answers to all your questions.  Be sure you understand how the procedure(s) will be done and that any concerns you have are addressed. 2 - Follow all instructions for pre- and post-surgery and make sure they are explained well, especially post-op when you are sore, tired, and ready to go home.  Check over any written information you are given post-op and have the person driving you home do so as well.  My mom and I failed to notice that my doctor did not include the quantity of pills on my pain med prescription and the pharmacist refused to fill it.  My doctor wasn't on call that evening and one of her partners worked with the pharmacist to get what I needed for that night, but the next day we had to start again with my doctor and get a new prescription, which I had to authorize my mom to pick up in person.  The whole issue turned out to be due to a computer error.  Make sure it is all correct before you go home! 3 - Bring a pillow that you can place over your abdomen for the post-op ride home.  I got this advice here in the forums and it was a huge help.  I left a bed pillow in the car and then placed it over my abdomen so I could still use the seatbelt afterward with minimal discomfort.  You'll also want this pillow to hold if you have to cough, sneeze, etc. until the pain begins to let up.   4 - After having had a tube in your throat during surgery, your throat will be dry and you may have a hoarse voice or get laryngitis.  Drink fluids and keep some non-menthol or other throat drops or mints on hand.  Warm/hot tea is great, too.  It took a week for my voice to be normal again. 5 - Get plenty of rest and don't overdo it.  Easier said than done, I know, especially if your family relies on you, but having had both procedures in one surgery, my belly was very swollen and painful.  Let others help you as needed.  As my doctor said, though, you won't be bedridden and will have to get up and around some (I was given instructions about this).  Don't overdo it.  Don't try to lift anything heavy or bend over to pick things up right away.  Let yourself heal. 6 - Bring something comfortable to wear home after surgery.  I went home in a nightgown, robe, and rubber-soled house shoes as recommended by my mom.  You just want something that won't be too tight with any painful swelling.  I was still groggy when I got home and went to bed right away. 7 - Take the pain medicine as prescribed.  Don't wait until the pain is worse.  8 - You may have some bleeding following surgery.  On my second day post-op, I started having what was likely my period, due to how my current cycle pattern is going, but a nurse told me that you can bleed following laparoscopy for about 7-10 days.  It should be no heavier than a period; if it is, call your doctor.  9 - You may not want to eat much for the first day or two due to swelling.  Keep meals and snacks light, especially if you have digestive issues.  Basically, I was like this for about two days and then started to be hungry again. 10 - Your doctor will recommend a period of recovery time.  I was given the recommendation of 2-4 weeks since I had two procedures.  At two weeks now, I still have soreness where the ovary was removed, but it is improving and I am taking Tylenol as needed, nothing else (I have Crohn's disease, thus no aspirin or ibuprofen).  I will return to work in two more weeks. I think that's all I wanted to say.  Let me know if I can answer questions and please share about your experiences and advice if you like."

I am def in peri and for the last 6 months Ive been feeling depressed, periods all over the place and just not myself. This added to the craziness. Just wanted to share. Ive had pain on my right side for 6 months. Went in and they said I was in peri for sure and looked like I had a large cyst and to watch and wait. I never had these symptoms before. My doc said the fluctuation of hormones can cause cysts so they wanted to put me on low dose of birth control pills but since I smoke cigarettes 5 cigs a day not packs lol I couldn't so we just watched and waited. I would get hot flashes, anxiety trembling sometime I would have to leave work I felt so bad. I finally went in again and the cyst they thought had grown to 5cm and I needed laparoscopic surgery. Come to find out my ovaries were fine my right fallopian tube was fulled with fluid . I had my tubes tied 8 yrs ago and at some point the clamp on the right side came off, with my hormones and periods being out of wack it caused my Fallopian tubes to fill with fluid and a cyst. They took out the Fallopian tube . As soon as I woke up although in small bit of pain I felt normal again; The anxiety is gone no more hot flashes as of now. Just wanted to share with you all. I know I am in peri but I do think what I was experiencing aggravated my symptoms . I am going to try and stop smoking so I can try the bc pills. I really appreciate this forum and knowing I am not alone on this journey. We will make it through this time!! xo"

I am 59 and all of a sudden started bleeding 2 months ago.  Long story short, went in, had an ultrasound and biopsy.  My lining was 10mm, which scared me to death...doctor gave me all kinds of scenarios.  Long story short, biopsy came back fairly normal, and my doctor was sure it was either a polyp or polyps.  Went in for a D&C and hysteroscopy at Women's Hospital.  Didn't have any problems at all.  Pathology came  back ALL CLEAR, and all polyps removed.  So before you worry yourselves too much, from what I have read this is what usually happens with this.  Good luck to all, just see your doctor and hope yours is a good turnout as mine was!"

This progressed into bowel cramping for a few weeks and a general feeling of being unwell.  Got so bad that I went to a doctor who referred me to a gastroenterologist.  Appointment’s tomorrow, but that has gone now.  It has been replaced by breathlessness - a feeling that my airways are narrower than they should be.  I’m trying to cough up phlegm but there’s nothing there.  Is this perimenopause?  If I could be sure it was it would really help because with each symptom I fear the worse - bowel cancer with the cramping and lung cancer with the breathlessness.

I feel very negative each morning when I wake up - I thought of death this morning - I’ve never been so frightened of it.     I lost my mum last year and all this is not helping with the grief.

Saw my GP & was sent for ultrasound plus transvaginal in November - lining was beautifully thin & all good. Only thing was right ovary not visible. Sonographer said she wasn't unduly concerned as with age they can shrink to nothing. GP backed this up & said sometimes we just have a flurry of hormones & a bit of a ""show"" because of that. Fast forward to last night, pink spotting again twice. Very ,very little but obviously has me concerned. No period type cramp this time. Nothing odd today. So my question is has anyone had a similar situation? I've coincidentally had to have an abdominal CT scan v recently for a bowel issue & nothing was flagged up to do with ovaries ( which I'm hoping I'm right in thinking a CT with contrast would have shown ovaries?) I'm obviously going back to gp Monday for reassurance & to ask them to pull the CT scan up & make sure all was def ok but meanwhile would appreciate any input. Bizarrely both times I got spots on my chin! So I'm trying to comfort myself that it's them there hormones flaring again! Thanks girls x"

Guest,2018-04-25T16:26+00:00,"Back on forum, getting real help","I hit bottom today with my lifelong anxiety.  I am 47 and have had peri symptoms for almost 4 years and there have been times when I have let fear keep me from getting care.  Tomorrow morning, I have a gyn appointment for help with some real, legitimately scary symptoms that I hoped would go away or be manageable without medical care.  Know what?  That’s the story of my life.  My narcissistic mother frowns on illness and thinks doctors are saints but doesn’t take good care of herself.  I have a chronic autoimmune disease on top of the peri and that’s the only thing that I get care for consistently because I can’t ignore it.   A few months ago, I chose not to call my gyn back when she tried to follow up on lab results.  I was frustrated and anxious (as usual) and decided my actions were justifiable when I wrote a complaint to her about my health and accused her of not understanding me.  When she replied, I never read the message.  I never called her back.  I let the fear swallow me whole.  It was not fair to her at all.  I got in touch with her today and apologized.  She never had a chance to try to help and wanted to help.   My mother has told me that she knows she has generalized anxiety disorder but has never been formally diagnosed and won’t seek help.  I cannot continue to be similarly arrogant.  I do not know better all the time.  Sometimes, I need help, maybe even a lot of help. I am always grateful for the Patient forums.  You have been here for me since my first gyn surgery two years ago and I have dropped out a few times but always come back.  This community is vital to my healing and wholeness and I am grateful for it.  Please send prayers, good thoughts and vibes my way.  I have an idea of what I am facing with these symptoms.  I also came clean today with my gyn about my lifelong anxiety and I pray that she will know who can help me. Bless you all."

I am trying to restrict sugar and sweets and eating yogurt but as long as I have severe hypoglucemic attacks, this is very difficult. Is there any lady with recurrent yeast infections during perimenopause? Is it possible my body craving sweets and carbs  because of the yeast or is ti a vicious cycle due to hormonal imbalances? I am leaning towards the hormonal imbalance.  Thank u"

Symptoms began hot flushes, night sweats, muscle aching .... now over last 6 months, I’m worn out with dursturbed sleep, still have burning hot flushes, agitation, and sometimes insomnia .... constant balance problems worst of all however, the horrendous Anxiety/Panic Attack.   Whether at home, work, hate supermarkets hot and noisy ! Burning knots in my tummy turn out of the blue into  Anxiety.  It’s that bad my balance is effected due to constant poor posture of being constantly tense. I am taking walks, gardening no gym however. Try to eat sensible ...drink daily plenty of water ...  got to stage where I have a glass of wine to ease my anxiety and I certainly do not want them go down that road, but it’s just a temporary relief from the constant battle with myself and menopause anxiety.   My work colleagues are young, they don’t really have an understand, therefore there is no support there, Female GP useless !  I have two interviews this week to get out of my present stressful job, sorry to say working with children for past 12 years I can’t do it anymore, I cannot stand the noise ... it makes me really poorly with anxiety.   I asked my GP for diazepam to help with me with interview, as I know the Anxiety will dampen the interview, so unfair ! Well tonight I took one to help me sleep naughty I know, but my anxiety has been so horrendous last few months, I need a break from it ... just 24 hours st least, I’m so tired with fighting all the symptoms for months, I just need that little break, to gain my strength !  I took a 5 mg, and feel relaxed and not one hot flush ... which I found strange. Will just take one when my Anxiety is extremely high, I think ... just now and again due to them highly addictive !  When my late mum use to to tell me about her symptoms, I would not always listen.  I am so sorry for that, as I know now what she was going through ! Sorry mum xx Sometimes as well I go to feel nauseated and blury visioned, tearful etc had all the tests done. And Im ok .... I know it’s this dreaded menopsuse curse ! xxxx Sorry about length of post, just needed to get it off my chest, with people who will most definitely understand xx"

Having a separate test specific for estradiol would even be better.   I recently had a hormone panel (age 61 and menopausal for 7 years)  and was surprised to find a TOTAL estrogen level of 114 pg/ml,  with an estradiol level of 15.4 pg/ml.   We all know the estrone takes over in menopause, but my surprise was based on the fact that I have been on a 0.05 Vivelle patch for over a month.  I though my estradiol level would have been higher, and was slightly surprised that my estrone was that strong. Love to hear of other women's levels."

Sometimes, I feel normal and happy, but at other times it is such a struggle to get through the day. I force myself to keep involved in activities that normally bring me happiness: cycling with my boyfriend, working in the garden, sitting in the sun... What I am finding so difficult is the negative self-talk and lack of self-support / love that seems to manifest when I get down.  I am not sure the best way to deal with it. Often, I will try a mantra, such as ""This is just your hormones"", ""This will pass"", or ""I have the courage to get through anything"". Sometimes it works, but definitely not always. I get so tired of the negative thinking, that I will, at times, just let the thoughts be there, as when I try to wrestle with them, they just seem to intensify. What's also hard is the rapid mood changes: I can go from deeply depressed to almost mildly euphoric in the blink of an eye. This makes it soooo hard to get through the days. Before all of these hormone changes, I was confident, happy, well-adjusted, and excited about life. I can start to get scared when I worry about my normally energetic, bubbly self being a thing of the past. Are there any other women who have experienced the same during perimenopause?"

elizabeth49339,2018-04-18T10:32+00:00,Is this a Panic Attack? I don't feel anxiety I feel depressed when it happens - Scared and alone,"I am 49 - I have had standard perimenopause symptoms for 9 years. My periods are fortnightly only last 24 hours and I am using bioidentical progesterone every day.  Last night something happened to me that's left me in tears as I write this thread I am so scared and alone, I had hoped things were getting better since these depressional waves and other symptoms started a month ago, but after last night I have given up hope of that happening as it was by far the most intense attack i have had to date.  I started with a feeling of emotional flatness which I have had before during the last month but not this intense. It creeps up on me and I notice I start to feel disinterested in the TV I had been watching (for example) and I am less and less connected to whatever I had been watching or doing.  This moves onto what I would describe as classic PMS depression, tears and very low mood and I actually feel sleepy too so lie down and doze on and off as the anxiety and depression plays on in the back of my mind.  I cannot sleep truly I just feel sleepy, so I am awake lead in bed and I start to feel detached from my environment, nothing feels or looks real anymore... I am in my own house and I recognise it but I feel like i'm trapped inside a bubble or my own head as well as feeling depressed and i DO mean depressed in a clinical sense.  I can hold a conversation about how I am feeling but thats all I can do. If my dog sits on my lap I cannot feel emotionally connected to her, I am stroking her like a robot...no emotion.  I feel like I am in a dream like bubble and its very intense. Of course THEN I start to feel anxious because I am so scared this spaced out drugged up is not going to end, that I will get ""stuck"" in this bubble of depression and derealisation. I feel weak, drowsy, dizzy, my body has a kind of buzzing sensation to it now... my limbs feel wobbly and weak. But my heart is not racing and I am breathing normally. I am NOT having a panic attack as I would have imagined it to be....I feel very depressed and very unreal and of course scared/worried about if this will ever end and pass. I am crying...hysterically scared of how I am feeling and how long I will feel this way.  I have read about people who are in a constant state of ""derealisation"" and honestly, to feel like that indefinitely I know hand on heart I would want to be dead..and I do not say that lightly. At this point, all I can think about is:  ""My God...please let me out of this feeling...I want my mind sanity back I NEED my mind back""  After about one half hours, It starts to lift. The TV will catch my attention again and I can follow the story and feel emotionally connected to what I am watching & hearing again and I can feel the dark fog lifting... and I am so relieved. Within 10 minutes I am back to myself, but very shaken....The whole ""thing"" lasted 3 hours but the most intense part with the derealisation lasted one and half hours.  Now of course I am a living walking mess because I this can occur at any time and next time maybe I will get stuck like that...  I have no one I can call or talk to. No one who can relate or tell me ""they have had it too"" and when I look online all I find are stories of usually younger people who are in a permanent state of derealisation or depersonalisation due to anxiety issues and panic disorders and all that does is add more anxiety to my anxious mind.  This all started AFTER I stopped eating sugars and started cleaning my diet up....????  I have read the symptoms of a ""Panic Attack"" and Derealisation and Depersonalisation are listed as one of the main symptoms of a panic attack but still, I am not aware of feeling anxiety when it starts only once I am in the middle of it. I have copied and pasted my personal symptoms from a list associated with Anxiety & Panic attacks.  Feeling of going crazy or losing control Feeling you might pass out A surge of doom and gloom Dizziness Trembling Feeling detached from reality Weak in the knees Hot and cold flushes Tingling sensations Derealization (feeling unreal, in a dream-like state) Dizziness, lightheadedness, unsteadiness Emotional distress Emotional upset Inability to calm yourself down Knot in the stomach, tight stomach Nausea Panicky feeling Feel like crying The last month has been hell. I stopped eating sugars started juicing veg cleaned up my diet and for what?? I have never ever been so sick and depressed.  I left a thread a couple of weeks ago about these new symptoms ive had for a month.  here: https://patient.info/forums/discuss/spaced-out-dreamlike-bright-vivid-colours-pms-perimenopause-hormones--647313"
Azzy2018,2018-04-17T20:04+00:00,"57, Menopause ended 4 years ago and today I spotted a blood clot in Urine","Hi, I am kind of freaked out and found this site.  I just went to the bathroom to urinate and was in deep shock to see my toilet tissue covered in fresh red blood and felt like I was back on my period days.  This was not just a drop in the tissue.  The tissue was saturated.  Just in shock!  I looked back in the toilet bowl and saw the size of a quarter a thick amount of a blood clot.  No bloody toilet bowl, just a little bit.  I was able to wipe and no more blood flow.  Here is stuff about me.  I have never had children, no pregnancies and divorced 15 years ago.  I have only had 3 partners in total life.  Last time sex with a partner was July 2017.  I will say it was very painful for me.  Even though menopause has passed, I still have all full desires and nothing has changed.  I take care of myself about 3 to 5 times a week as I still have all desires to do so.  I have read up on what this could be, not sure if this is thinning of the walls as I keep myself active and to avoid atrophy.  I have a very busy career and manage almost 100 staff and my career consumes me.  I intend to retire after 60 years old. I am freaked out by what this was today.  Is this some sign of cancer?  Or is this atrophy of the vaginal walls?  Is this an endometrioma clot?   I should mention that benign clots run on my mom's side of the family. My mom and her 2 sisters have all had very large benign clots removed from their uterus.  I believe this occurred when they were in their 60's.   I will say that I have a condition in my right hip called piriformis and so I always have sciatica down my leg and my buttocks.  I had just been lying down with my heat pad for my hip and had fallen asleep.  I use my heat pad all the time and this clot was a first.  I do have unusual tiredness but, this could be due to my diabetes that I acquired in 2014.  My history of my health is in my background section of my profile.  My midsection is always bloated and I do have a linear hernia and it is being monitored. I am disclosing all this just in case this is needed for the discussion.  I am guilty in late of getting a pap smear.  Guilty!  The last one was 3 years ago.    I will be making an appt. right now, however, was looking for peace of mind and anyone to help me stop freaking out right now.   thank you for your time."

But I’m wondering if they missed this, or am I just in a googling anxiety frenzy now????  My feet and legs are burning and I feel that pain in my back and slight flu feelings.

I've done everything in human power to try and feel better, lots of excercise, healthy eating, vitamins and suppliments, 2 different types of antidepressants for my anxiety and depression during this, tried changing to a less stressful job.....nothing has made me feel better. I have had periods of feeling good and totally appreciate those times but the moodiness (from being really negative and cranky or wanting to hide in bed and cry) slowly slips back. My self confidence is pretty much gone, I get upset if I have to do silly things out of the ordinary that relies on consintration. My brain does not work like it used to at all.....and I don't feel like going to the doctor anymore to explain all this once again. I started all this at 40 and Im 46 now, sometimes when I read other ladies posts and they are struggling at 55 or older I think OMG I can't do this for another 10 years. This is really messed up my life. Im a strong woman and have no problem making it through the physical syptoms and even occasionally not sleeping....and can take having a bad day here and there but when it's weeks stretches it's too much. I miss so much having fun and truly laughing. I know Im not the only one that feels this way and In sorry for coming across negative Im just venting on here as I can't really tell anyone Im close to and they don't understand how it feels at all.

I'm 50, have not had a period for 15 months but started bleeding 3 days ago which started off light and is getting heavier. I had my usual signs of an oncoming period before the bleeding started so I wasn't too alarmed. I went to my GP yesterday who is sending me for a scan next week. However, what I'm worried about (particularly as my mum had womb cancer when she was 57) is that the GP said: ""Sometimes there can be a bit of spotting after 12 months of no periods but it's very unusual for it to last for days."" This has really worried me. Has anyone else had more than just the odd bit of spotting, more like a proper period, once periods have stopped for over 12 months, but tests were all ok? I had a smear last Summer and also an internal scan for another issue which all came back ok. GP said it was last Summer so we need to do a scan again. X"

I am terribly sad because premature/ early perimenopause before 40's is not a physical transition and it is extremely rare...Unfortunately, It is pathological with many short term and long term consequences and the bad news is that it is irreversible I cannot believe the hormonal chaos that is happening to my body...Sometimes I do not want to accept it! I try to convince myself that I am in a nightmare and the next morning I will be healthy and normal again  but the pains, physical and emotional symptoms do not let me forget my miserable condition.  I've forgotten how it feels to be healthy What I have done to suffer like this!? ?The only thing that I know is that I am  unfortunate because sth weird is happening with my hormonal ""make up"".... probably an abnormality to my genes or idiopathic, autoimmune ovarian disorder ? ? ?"

arlette98229,2018-04-15T22:29+00:00,Dealing with other issues in life,Anyone finding it hard to deal with family and other issues on top of menopause. My mother passed away six yrs ago and my father has put a huge burden on us since about me and my sisters  not being in the same country as him and complaining about everything. He has rung and complained  several times a day each year for 6 yrs. In the first few years after it happened it was truly horrendous.  I have only been able to visit once a year cant bear it but feel v guilty. My best friend is seriously ill and its not looking good for her at all and my young sister needs constant support and rings incessantly. If Im not exposed to other peoples problems I can just about manage but being surrounded by negativity on an hourly basis is making me shrivel up and is killing all hope in me -  I cant seem to escape other peoples issues.  Every time I start to feel a bit positive I get another negative update or graphic detail about various problems. I feel like cutting all ties with everyone sometimes.  Its difficult when there are these life issues on top of menopause as friends and family dont see it as an issue. Despite menopause symptoms  I still feel like I could build a new chapter in life but people around me just drag me back down and cutting ties will fill me with guilt...  Anyone feel like packing a case and going to start something new?!

I have just been learning to deal with my symptoms and come to expect them every now and again whenever they rear their ugly heads.  However, I do have a question. At my last GYN exam, my doctor did labs on my hormone levels and it showed that my prolactin levels were slightly elevated. My regular doctor wants me to have an MRI done to check my pituitary gland and see if there isn't a growth which could be why the prolactin was elevated. Also my periods have been very irregular lately. I went a whole 34 days in January and in February I missed a cycle and then it didn't come on until day 39. Then in March it came on in day 23. A rollercoaster ride this has been. I just wondered if any of you ever had your prolactin levels be effected during this time?"

When I first arrive in Australia I was useing a compounding cream , a prescription that I brought with me from the States, after using it for three to four months I started having hot flashes and night sweats. I first asked the pharmacist about the  ingredients in the cream , I was told that  it may be the same medication but if it comes from a different provider the effects will be different.I found a GP and told him my story, he started me on Livial aka the miracle drug. Now to my problem I will be returning to the USA for a year.   Can anyone tell me weather or not has Livial been approved for use in the USA?"

marky18084,2018-04-13T08:49+00:00,Bi-Est .5% cream,I am an American living in Thailand.   I suffered severe pain during urination and finally was giving an urethrostomy.  After the procedure the doctor put me on Bi-Est .5% cream (nothing else is marked on cream).  He advised that this type of cream is no longer available in Thailand and is thus created in the hospital pharmacy.   The problem with this cream is that it needs to be kept in the refrigerator and costs $50 for a 2 month supply.   I have searched high and low and am having trouble finding out about this cream.  My goal is to be able to purchase it through an American store or pharmacy .    Does anyone have any information on this that an help me  obtain a replacement cream? Thank you
jayneejay,2015-01-23T15:53+00:00,Peri Menopause and Menopause Homeopathic Help,"This may be of interest to some ladies  it certainly interested me .. This was not written by me, this was info i have found and saved to share . Over 150 symptoms have been attributed to PMS, Perimenopause & Menopause including feeling ""out of control,"" anxious, depressed, and irritable with uncontrollable crying spells.  Physical symptoms may include food cravings (especially for chocolate), bloating, fluid retention and weight gain, headaches/migraines and fatigue, backache, constipation, painful joints and/or heart palpitations. Menopause/Perimenopause Menopause is the transition period in a woman's life when her ovaries stop producing eggs, her body produces less estrogen and progesterone, and menstruation becomes less frequent, eventually stopping. Perimenopause can occur up to ten years before cessation of menses.  Some women's menstrual flow comes to a sudden halt, but most women can have more or less frequent periods over time before they come to a final halt.  Symptoms of menopause include pounding heart, hot flashes, night sweats, skin flushing, insomnia, low libido, forgetfulness, irregular periods, mood swings, vaginal dryness, joint aches, fatigue and feeling overwhelmed.  The average age of menopause is 51 (mostly between age 45 and 55), but menopause can occur in the 30s or as late as the 60s. Homeopathy for PMS and Menopause Homeopathy addresses the whole person, not merely the illness.  With over 3,000 remedies to choose from, the homeopath must determine the indicated remedy (constitutional remedy) according to each woman's individual pattern of symptoms.   I will discuss a couple of cases and the indicated remedy for each case.  Keep in mind that these are but a few examples from the bounty of remedies available for women with PMS and menopause. This is to be used for educational purposes only.  Do not treat yourself. A professional homeopath has knowledge of and access to your correctconstitutional remedy.  Pulsatilla (Wind Flower):  This is a plant remedy known to be useful for sensitive, emotional people who are gentle, nurturing and need support and affection.  Known as ""the weather-cock of remedies,"" Pulsatilla women are mild, gentle and yielding.  ""Mentally, an April day,"" women with changeable, contradictory moods and symptoms may benefit from this remedy. Weeping and depressed women during PMS with irregular, varying periods. Usually has a healthy sex drive and enjoys intimacy. This woman can have unstable circulation (warm head, cold feet, varicose veins) and feels better in the fresh open air and worse in a warm, stuffy room. Worse when alone, better with company and consolation.  Thirstless, peevish and chilly or warm-natured.  Crying spells and fear of the dark, being alone and ghosts.  Highly emotional and easily discouraged, this woman benefits from affection, gentle motion or walking in fresh air.  Useful for PMS or menopause with hot flashes worse in warm, stuffy rooms and better from walking in fresh air, and irregular periods in a weepy, changeable and gentle person.  Pulsatilla Case Study:  A thirty year-old gentle, mild, yielding woman complains of being ""bipolar"" along with diarrhea and sinus infections worse from drinking milk.

General dread/anxiety with desire to cry for no reason.Moody/tearful/angry feelings center around feeling disappointed by her husband'sperceived lack of attention to her.

Her goal is to become more emotionally stable without medications and to start her period and get pregnant.  Three months after starting Pulsatilla 200C, her crying has stopped and her energy has improved. Sleep is good and she is able to clean house and be productive. Not as needy for husband's attention. Moods are stable and she can do anything she needs to.  Fear of robbers and abandonment is much better. Anxiety/dread is a thing of the past.  She is hot natured now.

She lost a child to a freak accident. She is afraid of losing her sons and has a fear of not being good enough for God (her father was a Baptist preacher).  She is afraid of failing to be a good person. She has body image issues and had a gastric bypass to lose 100 pounds. She has to work on body image and her self esteem. Her father abused her when she was young and she couldn't tell her mother, who remained in the marriage. Her mother was either loving or screaming ""hell on us.""  Client tries to get away from anger. Then she puts up a fuss and fights back. She is bubbly, funny, and can be ""hell on wheels.""  She gets things done and hates procrastination. She likes company and alone time to meditate and read scriptures. She is chilly and hates winter.  Has been moody all of her life, and has had suicidal thoughts when severely depressed in the past.  She likes to stay in bed and be left alone when depressed. She gets grumpy during PMS (two days before her period), which is relieved by the flow. Hormones are terrible for a few days, and she is more depressed with fluid retention and weight gain.  It feels like pressure, like heruterus is falling out.  Sinuses worse before a thunderstorm with pain in her head and above and behind her eyes.  She feels worse in damp, rainy weather and better in sunshine. Uses SAD light in the winter. Can be bossy and irritable, then sarcastic with those she loves.   The first remedy given was Lycopodium 200C for reflux and self-esteem issues.  Two months later, reflux and irritable bowel improved, but PMS and periods continued. Exhaustion continued with aversion to sex.  Sepia 200C was then given, followed by improvement in energy, attitude, not as cynical, more accepting of herself and others, improved mood during PMS and less fearful.  She has continued to do well on Sepia 200C, then 1M over the past few months. She is considering going to graduate school to further her career.  Pulsatilla, Lycopodium and Sepia are only three of the many homeopathic remedies which can be useful in women with PMS or menopausal symptoms which match the correct remedy picture (description of the symptoms a remedy can cause in a healthy person and heal in an ill person; each remedy picture is published in homeopathicmateria medicas for use by homeopathic practitioners)."

Ive been in Meno hell for about a year and desperately trying supplements, accupuncture etc etc for what ails me. After being on these bio identicals and attempting to 'trouble shoot' them to 'get them right' after doing labs, im still exacly the same.  Not balanced, depressed, and battling anxiety all of which have turned my life upsidedown.  I do what everyone does but it take fierce efforts to get through each without exaggeration. My question for those women who have used bio identicals..Do you feel its helped or not? Im starting to think that for me maybe its not going to ever help. Im tempted to maybe let nature just take its course and run out all of my hormones and see if i feel better. With the bio identicals, i feel like im in a state of premenstrual syndrome x 10, 24/7. Just the real hormonally fragile, emotional, imbalanced feeling that we get before our period.. Im tempted to go off them but afraid that it could be worse without them? your thoughts.. xoxox"

Had full blood count, thyroid and ferritin blood tests..all came back no further action required. Doc also gave me blast of high dose Vit D. Then in last week or so feel like it’s got worse and anxiety has kicked in where I feel panicky not knowing what’s wrong. This then escalated to discomfort in chest and palpitations and a trip to A&E feeling like I was having a heart attack! Anyway long story short and a visit to a cardiologist my hearts fine (phew!)but that doesn’t solve my lightheadedness issues! Then I researched Vit B12 deficiency and my symptoms are very similar. I thought as my doc did my Ferritin blood test that he might of thought to do B12 too! I called surgery and they said my ferritin level was 59..this is on low side as range is 50-150. Does anyone know if that’s considered low enough to be experiencing my symptoms?  Also if my ferritin is considered normal could I still be deficient in  B12?  Thinking I need to get doc to get me a B12 test.  Failing that are any of you post menopausal ladies experiencing this horrible feeling on a daily basis and have you found any relief? My periods stopped 18 months ago but guess we can go on getting symptoms for years! Joy!!! I do wonder if a lot of this is do to with anxiety. 😩 another symptom of menopause!

I go thru spurts of staying in just because it's comfortable and I can be myself.  Usually, I panic around holidays and other events, even work too. It's horrible as I shouldn't feel like this-- when I was younger I always went with the flow.  Now I believe I tend to 'over think' things.   So I saw a friend about 2 weeks ago and her hair was amazing and she mentioned it was probably Spirulina helping.  So since my hair has been thin and limp, I bought some pills-- she takes it in the powder form.  Well, after a few days I noticed that I was calm-- Easter was around the corner and I didn't think twice about it.   Went to church and then in-laws for a gathering..   It was like I was at peace.  Very strange because I tend to 'worry' about gatherings.  So I'm wondering if it was the Spirulina or maybe now the anxiety is just gone..  I don't know so I thought if someone would like to try and see if they notice a difference with it as well.  I've read that it's a superfood and helps with many things..  Could help someone else.  : )"

I'm 49 and I started taking hrt 6 months ago because at that time I started suffering terrible perimenopausal symtoms: insomnia, mood swings, anxiety, brain fog, joint paint, peeing all night, and all that fun stuff. Also 6 months ago my periods went from 5 days in length to 10-20 days in length with start and stop flow. Fun stuff as you all know. Anyway my doctor put me on femoston 2 mg and it didn't effect my periods (which are still long, heavy, start and stop) but helped with all my other perimenopause symptoms! Has that been the experience with anyone here? Does taking HRT make your periods lighter or shorter? Thank you for all your help."

Chris1230,2015-07-31T13:21+00:00,So Hot All Night But Not Really Sweating,"Hi everyone.  This is a great forum. Just spent the last hour reading through older discussions.  I didn't really see one quite like mine, so I thought I'd start a new discussion. I will be 52 years old in a few months. All my life, my period was like clockwork until about 3 years ago, when I starting skipping one occasionally.  I've been a little lucky that they've gotten a bit lighter.  For the past year, I've been having a period every 2 months, quite regularly.  I don't mind this at all, but I know what's coming. Last year, I all of a sudden starting getting really, really hot at night.  This was very much out of nowhere.  I dealt with it for a few weeks (it was constant) and then I thought, ""Wait a minute, maybe it's my thyroid medication.""  I have been taking thyroid meds since my 30s when I had my thyroid removed for thyroid cancer.  I've been pretty stable since then, but there have been a few changes since 2012 with brand names and manufacturers so things haven't been as stable.  I decreased my dosage and within a week, the heat was gone!  I remained on a lower dose for months and then, increased it back up this past March.  I was doing fine again, until June.  The hot flashes started up again.  I waited for a few weeks and then, 2 weeks ago, decreased my dosage again. This time it did not help.  So, this is probably not by thyroid.  I do have an appointment with my endocrinologist in the meantime to sort that out. But, I'm thinking hot flashes.  What confuses me is that it rarely happens during the day.  It was happening starting at midnight each night and going until about 3AM.  Now it is starting around 10PM and going all night. My room is very cold and I am under blankets.  Then I heat up like an OVEN. It's amazing.  I throw the covers off and then I cool off, get freezing cold, and then covers go back on and it goes on like this all night.  I don't really have the drenching night sweats that I read about, although I get kind of clammy where I have contact.  Such as behind my knees, between thighs if my legs are together, and that sort of thing.  When I get up to look at myself, I'm not even flushed (and I flush easily). It bothers me because this doesn't really sound normal. Again, I 99% fine during the day (but I am in a lot of air conditioning during the day). I've changed out all my blankets to lighter ones, keep my room frigid, and wear comfortable night clothes.  It just goes on all night. Does this sound abnormal?  Thanks! Christine"
olive8,2018-04-07T12:52+00:00,Constant feeling of UTI,For a long time I have had a feeling of having a UTI and also stinging when passing urine.  Have had lots of urine tests all negative so doctor has given me estriol vaginal cream I have no discharge or bleeding just this terrible uncomfortable feeling. My doctor said it was a very weak cream and didn't xpect it to give me any problems. have to insert this cream every night for a week then three nights a week for two weeks then once every week ongoing. I have just finished the week of nightly and will start three times a week on Monday Wednesday and Friday. I suppose it is a bit better but still there and I think it has given me a headache with flashing lights. Not all the time but did today - better now. I spoke to a nurse who said it would take at least a month until I felt any better.

I have been experiencing many of the same symptoms that all of you have written about here.  It’s probably going on for a couple of years.

Many test for my heart and stomach and several months later, everthing  came back normal. Thank goodness.   it was during the time that I found this forum and if it wasn’t for all of  you I would have had a really rough time getting through it.  it was very comforting reading about how all of you have been going through pretty much a lot of the same things that I have been going through. Since that night and day I have not been able to lay flat in bed. I have to prop up many pillows behind me and practically sit If I end up flat I wake up with my heart racing and my stomach going crazy again and pretty much a lot of the other symptoms.  like all of you I’ve been having trouble sleeping to begin with and then this happened!   just wondering if any of you have experienced anything at all like this?

Str8tfans,2018-04-07T03:46+00:00,Frequent headaches and type,"Hello ladies!  I’m having one of those little “freak out” nights here, as we all do sometimes. I’ve had an on and off headache for like three days.  Allergies are bad down here in fl right now, and if I knew it was that for sure I wouldn’t be having a health anxiety fit right now lol. Do y’all ever get headaches that like, jump spots?  Like I’ll have it in the back/top of my head, then it’ll move like behind one ear, then it’ll be up from on top and my forehead with my eyes feeling all right and weird. Then maybe go away for awhile then come back in any one of those spots. I AM a little stuffed up in my nose right now but not “that” bad. I can still breath clear but definitely stuffy. And sneeze now and then, some coughing randomly like when allergies literally land in your throat. My other thought is neck/shoulder tension. Can that cause these types of headaches? Been sleeping pretty rough the last week or so. Also when the headache lingers for a bit, I get the “whoosh whoosh” sound in my head. Drives me nuts because as anyone with health anxiety knows, we always right away think “stroke” or something sinister. I’m also of course wondering if it’s the wonderful Peri/hormones too. My period ended about 4 days ago, so that would mean I’m about ten days into my cycle. Idk what our hormones are doing ten days in. Anyone?"

bev27429,2018-04-03T15:10+00:00,Dealing with Depression in Perimenopause,"I'm wondering how other women are dealing with depression in perimenopause. I guess that I am hoping that there is some miracle cure out there. I have been trying to just put one foot in front of the other and keep going. I have kept a journal from the start, and I can see that things have really intensified in the last year. Prior to that, mood-wise, I was stable. I am turning 50 later this year. My periods have also changed dramatically: much lighter and shorter. Often, I start spotting on about day 18 of my cycle.  Some weeks, my moods are fairly stable. In fact, at some times, I feel totally peaceful and blissfully happy. Then, the darkness descends again. It's so difficult shifting between these opposite mind states. I don't want to take pharmaceuticals, but it is so challenging to walk this path unmedicated. I keep telling myself that I am so strong and can get through anything, but when I feel down, I tend to have negative thoughts about myself and my life; when this happens, I tell myself that it is just hormones, as, when I feel well, I am confident, energized, and excited about life. I have a great life: lots of friends, a loving boyfriend, work I enjoy, a home by the sea, lots of interests. I just feel sad that I don't seem able to consistently enjoy what I have. I feel like I am living my life on pause. Any feedback would be so greatly appreciated."

I have been in peri for about a year and a half now and as most us having certain issues are worse than others and certain things can trigger certain issues.  When I'm really having a tough time I go to my mothers and hang out, sometimes spend the night as she helps me to relax and understands what I'm going through.  My husband has always been supportive when I have had to do this in the past and let me do what I need to do to help me.  So now here is my issue, whenever my husband gets sick either a cold or tummy bug etc it seems to set off my anxiety, I get nervous, think the worst, feel nauseous and cant deal with it.  I want to go to my moms because I know that I will feel better but then I feel bad because I'm the wife and I should be there with my husband when he doesn't feel well and don't want him upset with me etc.  I have been asking my mother and friends about this and they all said the same thing, you have to take time and take care of yourself, that I'm no good to him if I'm not ok.  I was wondering what you all thought about this?   I am really starting to try and take care of myself 1st and then deal with everything else from there..  any help would be wonderful   thanks so much  hugs"

It seem to be worse during ovulation or before period time along with the bloating. If i pass gas or have a bowel move it helps but at the same time the bowel move brings on the nervousness and anxiety from it right afterward. I mentioned it to my GI dr. on my last visit and he said it could be muscle spasm from the stomach. But the weirdiest thing it seem to disappear late night or when my period comes on.

Now I know this symptom is typically a side effect of anxiety and whilst I would say I am like more women ""a bit of a worrier"" I am not experiencing severe anxiety.... or at least I don's think I am...I have times when i worry obsessively and everything is potential failure and times when I am anxious about a specific event or issue and I KNOW I am being motivated by hormones ... but when these dreamlike states come over me..I am not anxious nor does it make me anxious....worried long term yes but I am not experiencing a panic attack or hyper ventilating etc.....

So I stopped bleeding on the Sunday everything was fine no spotting then on the Saturday I had the 1 day of mid cycle spotting, I haven't had any spotting since but I have had random pinpricks of blood so small that I wouldn't have noticed them if I wasn't looking, I have become very obsessed about checking and I am petrified every time I go to the loo, so I am 4 days away from my period, and this is how it's been, I am 45 next month my smear was done 10 months ago and other symptoms I have been having are night sweats but they have subsided now, disturbed sleep waking5-6 times a night, joint and back pain, terrible brain fog(found my purse in the outside bin yesterday), I am to scared to go to the Drs as I suffer with health anxiety and it take everything I have got to have my smear, just to add to this my daughter did have her first baby last month so I'm not sure if stress has made it worse. anyway I am sorry to go on so long many thanks  herbie"
jacky02866,2017-02-28T17:42+00:00,progesterone or not for endometrial hyperplasia,"just wondering what the procedure was for you lot who thought they were post-menopause (i had  no period for 18 months at 55 years old) then a slight bleed and all the usual ovulating symptoms. I had all the usual tests....ultrasound, lining 7mm......too thick so a  biopsy and hysteroscopy.  The results came back saying endometrial hyperplasia, nothing more so i was told to take oral progesterone for 3 months and then come back for another biopsy.  I didn't take the tablets because i was so worried they would make me more anxious and depressed than i already am. Today i went for my appointment (6 months) after the last one, i was expecting another biopsy as i was told i would but they didnt do one. I explained to the gyno that i saw about my fear of the tablets and he said that it didn't really matter if i take them or not as the biopsy was normal....just endometrial hyperplasia.....he gave me the option of either having the coil fitted or doing nothing at all. Im a bit confused as to why the first gyno was concerned enough for me to take a strong dose of progesterone but this gyno was giving me the option of doing nothing.....he said the only time i need to see him again is if i have another bleed a year or more after the last bleed. I was wondering what other post.....but not quite woman have gone through."

Terbear53,2017-08-05T15:35+00:00,Feeling concerned after being told they found thickening of the lining of my uterus.,"Hi...I am 53 years old and I haven't been feeling well in the last two weeks. My stomach has been bothering me and my intestines felt sore and swollen, so my doc sent me for an ultrasound of the stomach and pelvis. At that time I was told I had a low grade fever too. In the past I had been taking the birth control pill to control my heavy periods as I have a bleeding disorder called ITP (low platelets). At the end of October 2016 I stopped taking the pill in preparation for my total knee replacement surgery in November. Since the surgery, my mentstural cycle stopped and I figured I was starting menopause. I was also experiencing hot flashes. After 9 months of no cycle, I got a period again, heavy bleeding and clots (though not as big as I have had in the past). After the ultrasound my doctor called me in to his office and said I had thickening of the lining of my uterus. He said it could mean cancer, but it can also mean something else, so he's sending a referral to the woman's clinic for a biopsy. Then he informed me that this process can take 2 months to get in for the biopsy and now I am sitting here worrying. Everyone tells me not to worry until I know for sure, but I can't help feeling scared. He's also referring me to a Gastroenterologist because though the stomach ultrasound didn't show anything, I am having issues that require further investigating and I possibly may need an endoscopy."

I’ve been doing better with my health anxiety over headaches, heart palps, things I can pinpoint down to certain times of the month, and stuff like that, I don’t “totally” freak out over those  anymore (as often).  But I’ve become obsessed with feeling my pulse in my neck and find myself constantly putting my hand up there to feel it.  I’ll feel a little flutter on the side of my neck and then reach and feel it.  I’ve gotten to  where I obsess over it EVERY day now to the point where I don’t know if there’s ACTUALLY something “fluttering” where it shouldn’t be....or if it’s just anxiety causing me to be hypersensitive about it!  Sometimes I’ll feel my pulse there, then press down until I can feel the “swish” in my vein...then I’ll really freak out and think “is that suppose to feel that way??” I know this sounds nuts (which I think most of us have felt a little nuts at this point lol) but I’m just wondering if anyone else has had THIS specific health anxiety focus before, and if so, did you get it checked and what was the outcome?

I went for an ultrasound and everything was as it should be . Uterus lining is currently about 2.9mm which I'm told is fine. Last April the same thing happened again! I had another ultrasound and everything was fine. About 2 weeks ago I had the same thing! Also ive noticed alot of different discharge I was told to keep a diary whenever it happend. Sometimes the discharge is sticky , stretchy, cloudy. I just don't know whats going on. I didn't have any discharge up until the last couple of years and I think it's increased over the last few months, unless I'm just more aware of it.

About 15 min ago (I should be about a week and 3 days from starting my period by the way) I suddenly felt almost like tingles around my face. The best way to describe it. Then just “woozy” not quite dizzy. Heavy head, and a “bit” of a headache trying to push through.  Then felt like I had to go to the bathroom, did, and THOUGHT I’d feel better immediately because my digestive issues sometimes make me feel terrible until I go to the bathroom. Then felt very “clogged” around my nose and forehead, UGH it’s all so freaking WEIRD y’all!

Prior to meno i did not experience such low mood as i do now. All of the symptoms that most of you describe ive had to a degree, i just feel like im in another world. Ive tried different antidepressants and they are not tolerable, i dont last but a few days. Im pretty scared because i dont know how long i can keep up the show..facing the day everyday. I have two awesome boys that are mid teens and i raise them alone. The responsibiity of them relying on me, is too much. I have moments that are ok, but for the most part i have to fake my way through life and its exhausting.  ive tried bio identicals, yoga, everything, and my brain is not the same. Its dreadful. My labs even on the saliva tests that i did show that the hormones are fairly balanced which causes me even more concern. How could i have lost all happiness and my mind at 53? Prior to this i did not know about anxiety or depression. I would get moody and down every month but it was short lived. Never have i felt so scared and misunderstood in my life. By far the worst thing that has every happened to me. I want to feel normal so badly, i want to live life, but its not there its not in me. I feel almost ashamed and do not know how to explain to my kids what has happened because I myself do not know what has happened.. I wake up with a sense of DOOM and fear, i feel adrenaline rushes and am absolutely exhausted the same time.

jo4848,2018-03-23T07:50+00:00,"Perimenopause, horrid periods and the mini pill :(","Hi all, I hope someone can relate and offer some info/reassurance on this. I am 45 and my symptoms started about 8 months ago with spotting between periods. I used to run and exercise 4-5 times a week and this would happen only after a heavy run. It really freaked me out and I eventually saw my GP (female in her late 40s/early 50s I'd say). She straight away said peri and reluctantly gave me a blood test which showed slightly low iron. She also took the most painful swabs and when these came back clear, referred me for an ultrasound, telling me to man up and brace myself as these would hurt too! So I spent the next 6 weeks worried sick about the procedure which (after reading some reassuring info on here) turned out to be fine. They found a small polyp and/or fibroid and referred me to see a specialist for a hysteroscopy and removal of the offending polyp.  In the meantime, my periods got even worse. They have always been heavy but completely painless all my life (lucky, I know) but have recently got even heavier which they blamed either on peri or the polyp/fibroid. The hysteroscopy wasn't successful as my cervix is pointing backwards and she couldn't get to the area but managed to take a biopsy which came back fine. I was offered to either try again with a different, more experienced gynecologist or get it done under general. As I am scared of general, I opted for the first option. During the procedure, he again, couldn't get all of what he said was a fibroid now but took a second biopsy and that came back fine too. So he said he was sure it wasn't anything sinister and probably just hormone related or my lining shedding a little from the running, etc and advised me to see if I can put up with the spotting during exercise and also go on the pill. So I went to see my GP again and she reluctantly prescribed the minipill after I refused the coil (she also told me I'd be back asking for it!). I am wondering if they are on commission to 'sell' you the coil lol, everyone I saw, tried to get me to have it but I'm not that keen so went for the mini progestin only pill.  I started this on the first day of my period and bled longer than usual. My periods are normally 7 days now and very heavy but I bled for about 11 days, with the last days light. A quick search on the internet showed that this is a common side effect of Cerazette and should/could settle within a few months. I have just about had enough of this. My periods are soooo heavy, I have to get up in the night, twice, because otherwise I will leak. I am a teacher and dread this time of month as I don't think I will last an hour even with double protection (sorry if TMI). It's really getting me down. I've stopped exercising, have put on some weight and find myself constantly worrying about my periods. I have missed social events and trips because of that and it's just ruling my life at the moment. Just wanted to hear from someone in a similar situation, especially if you have any experience with the Cerazette pill.  Click here to view image"

My husband of 30 years chatted on Facebook with his ex of over 34 years after he said he asked me if it was okay after she contacted him first. I don't remember saying that I didn't care, but then again my mind has been like Swiss cheese lately and I find myself forgetting what I said 15 minutes ago. So 6 months later I noticed he was texting with her on and off and I got p****d. He said she would contact him and he would respond to whatever it was. He says that he has always loved me and would never do anything to hurt me and if he thought that this would have upset me this much he would have never kept up the correspondence. He has not said a word to her for almost a year and yet I keep obsessing over and over about it. Like why did he continue for so long and was it because of the way I've been these last 10 or so years, but he keeps reassuring me I did nothing and he was just being nice and didn't want to be rude to her. He never tried to hide anything, but I don't ever really look at his phone and one day I did and saw her name. He didn't act like it was anything and was even shocked that I got upset. I have been bothering him about this for almost a year and I know this is not normal, but I can't seem to get off this self-destructive merry-go-round. It still wakes me up in the middle of the night."

First Dr was a locum & thought I probably was peri & gave HRT patches but I ended up crying, feeling down & anxious. I saw another Dr (both female) who said to come off them & as I was still having periods I wasn't menopausal! She gave me propanalol for anxiety & took bloods. Went back for results & review (another different female dr!) who said hormones were normal but thyroid was 5.4 so slightly hypothyroid but they wouldn't treat that level but to continue with propanalol as it was helping. Anxiety is more manageable but seems to increase about day 4/ of my cycle which is when I think estrogen starts to rise. I know hormones are all over the place in peri but I think I am probably estrogen dominant so thought progesterone cream might balance things out? Any advice greatly appreciated. Jo"

I'm 55, per hormone blood work I'm in menopause. That being said, I went thru short period of menopausal symptoms, survived but then out of the blue had a period & then spotting here n there. The periods, which were regular heavy flow for 2 days followed by 5 or so days till finished, WERE regular periods. Appetite increased & bloated. SO, my Dr does endometrial biopsy (ouch!) which was OK, no cancer. I've had 2 ultrasounds to finally find that I had a 1 inch polyp which I'm having removed April 13. However, during all this testing & Appts, I had a period July 2014, Nov 2014, Feb 2015 and guess what? Started full blown period yesterday, Apr 3!! What's so confusing & frustrating to me is my Dr confirms for me that removing the polyp WILL stop my ""periods"" ?? Although, he say, you're really not having periods, just abnormal bleeding. I beg to differ as I know my body and it's having a PERIOD! What is going on? I'm seeing ""oestrogen surges""? What r these? AND I've started getting itchy spots (red) under my chin and all over my neck, comes & goes. Is this hormonal? I dont think it's a food allergy. Ahhh what's happening? I don't agree with the dr as I know this is a period yet my blood work says I'm menopausal....so??? Anybody have any answers? Removal of the polyp is unquestionable and I can see it being cause of spotting, but is it REALLY the cause of an occasional 7 day period? Or is it hormonal? I really don't want to go on any hormonal therapy meds....desperately looking for feedback :o)"

I'm not sure if these are perimenopause related but just recently alongside all the more common symptoms, both have been quite intense.  I was convinced I had headlice at first, but I've checked and double checked and can find nothing, and yet my head is constantly itchy and it drives me crazy. Its getting embarrassing keep scratching my head all the time!!!  Also in the last 2 weeks I've noticed my eyes have felt so sore. I can only liken it to when I was younger and everybody smoked, if you spent an evening in a smoky pub, you would go home with sore eyes from the smoke. They feel like this almost everyday!  Does anyone else have these issues? Are these more symptoms of this lovely chapter of my life??  Thanks"
bev27429,2018-03-20T04:52+00:00,Overwhelmed with Perimenopausal Symptoms,"I am 49, and I have been going through intense symptoms for the past eight months: deep depression, scary thoughts, crying jags, screaming, moments of rage. These symptoms are very uncharacteristic for me. They are interspersed with periods of feeling totally normal: peaceful, optimistic, happy. It is exhausting living this way, and I pray that I will soon enter menopause. I am a very strong person, but these hormones are really pushing me to the edge. I have tried every med known to man, but nothing works. I know that time will change everything, but it is so hard to soldier on! I stay active, work, and socialize, but sometimes I can feel like it is all just too much. Can anyone relate to my experience?"

sarah86682,2018-03-20T10:41+00:00,Epilepsy meds and premenopause,"I've been on Carbemezapine for 25yrs for Epilepsy. Luckily my seizures are controlled. Looking back I think started perimenopause in my early 40s and now at 47 im getting more and more symptoms. Just recently the worse one is feeling so down and depressed. Feelings of inadequacy, worthlessness and uselessness. I cry at the slightest thing. Id like to take a multi vitamin or something to pick up my mood but the last dr I spoke to just suggested I speak with a counsellor and the lady in my local health food shop didnt have a clue. The internet is a minefield. Does anyone else take these meds and can recommend anything. If not i guess I'll have to keep trying different doctors???"
leslie95604,2018-03-01T15:56+00:00,BHRT finally dialed in hopefully!! Wow what an unbelievable difference!!,"I have been suffering beyond comprehension for over two years with what I thought was antidepressant withdrawal or a combination of that and you name it, whatever else my health anxiety would focus on that day. Eventually discovered through extensive lab testing I am in post menopause and manufacturing very little of the sex hormones. Estrogen was next to zero and Progesterone was extremely low as well. God, no wonder I felt like I was dying! I am not being dramatic when I write that. Lack of hormone support is debilitating and life threatening. So began the process of getting onto bioidentical hormone replacement. A few bumps at the beginning, well, I am still at the beginning but I am over the initial hump that I wrote about in a previous post. This marks my third full day of using the transdermal cream and it's an absolute miracle. I can not comprehend how I could go from how intensely I was suffering to total relief in a matter of minutes. It is like having the ultimate migraine, flu, heart palpitations, indigestion, fractured hips, overwhelming anxiety and depression instantly removed. . . What in the world????? I will be in this flabbergasted state for some time to come because it's just so strange! It's great, don't get me wrong, but my gawd what a difference!! Can you tell I am amazed here? :-P I admit the jury is still out a bit for me only because when you've suffered to the degree and duration that I have you don't let your guard down automatically. You become accustomed to dying so psychologically it may take a bit for me to phase out of that mindset. If any of you out there are hanging on to dear life from hormonal imbalances, please, please, if you are able, do whatever you can to get onto BHRT. We can live again! I want to see a change in the way women are expected to just simply endure the torture of hormone imbalance. If it's just a hot flash here or there, maybe a bout of short term insomnia, that's doable. But too many women suffer to a debilitating degree like me where you are rendered bedridden. I am not a weakling. I am just one of those women whose hormones plunged after a hysterectomy and received zero aftercare. Thank you God for moving in the people who were led to research and find the solutions to hormonal imbalances. Like the song goes, ""It's a new day, a new life for me. """

sherbell,2018-03-19T18:32+00:00,Pre or post menopause,"Hi everyone.. first time here and in need of help from women more versed in menopause then me. I'm 49 today. Had a partial hysterectomy 10 or so years ago. I have recently noticed some symptoms, mostly brain fog, intense brain fog... couldn't figure out how to make change the other day got flustered and embarrassed to the point of tears...some hot flashes but no sweat filled nights, extreme irritability. So I had blood work. The dr commented on the strange results showing one at pre and one at post. Now I'm trying to figure out what it means. The only thing I have intact is 1 ovary.. and I'm recently experiencing pain like I did with the other. I had a strangled ovary by a benign tumor... tubes were tied so he did the partial. Anyways.. my levels are as follows: FSH 26.7 LH 20.1 Estradiol 84 Can anyone tell me more? I have a host of other medical problems, 12 surgeries, thyroid, CRPS, and fibro. All other tests like thyroid are in normal range, no new meds recently, no lifestyle changes or unusual stress... but I feel like I'm losing my mind. I just feel like crap. Thanks!!!"
Giggle,2018-03-16T17:09+00:00,Unexpected and has knocked me for six,"Hi all, So pleased to find this site. Thank you in advance for reading my waffle and any insight you may be able to offer. A little about me. I'm 37 years old I started suffering with fatigue and feeling generally low back in 2012 and I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. Commencing Levothyroxine initially helped ease the symptoms but gradually the feeling of utter exhaustion, mental confusion etc returned and despite going back and forth to the GP my thyroid bloods indicated I was on the correct dose therefore I excepted that this was me and I had to adapt my life to cope therefore I left my stressful career. A few years ago my periods became irregular but I put this down to the stress of losing my dad and then my best friend. Last year I experienced my first ever UTI and I have had urinary frequency problems ever since. I was signed off sick from work November because could no longer cope. I could barely get of bed, I felt confused, repeatedly getting up in the night to pass urine. The doctor said he thought I was suffering with depression and commenced me on anti depressants. I was also referred to urology and i had a pelvic scan. Scan was normal and urologist said i had an irritable bladder. I went back to my GP a couple of weeks ago in tears and he decided to run some hormone blood tests and he phoned me last week with the results. He said the results were not what he expected. My Oestrogen levels are below 20! 😩 and he said anything below 20 would indicate Post menopause however I have a raised SHBG and normal FSH and LH. So confused by the results I am seeing an endocronologist next Friday so no doubt things will get a little clearer. The menopause never even entered my head and I'm feeling really emotional coming to terms with it. Has anyone had similar confusing blood results like the above? Will this get better with hormone replacement therapy as I currently I secretly wish of going to sleep and never waking up 😩 i'm just so tired of life. (I'm not thinking of doing anything to myself but I shamefully can't help thinking that way) Many Thanks"
caseynjason,2018-03-14T14:59+00:00,Just got results of hormone panel...menopause at 40!? Nurse said I can't go back??,"I've been taking bioidentical progesterone for a year, and I've been having light periods and recently just missed two periods completely.  Other symptoms ive been having are insomnia, panic attacks (one visit to ER), anxiety, fatigue, bloating, weight gain around middle (otherwise thin), loss of libido, dry skin, night sweats, and I am very prematurely gray (not sure if that has anything to do with it, but thank goodness for highlights!). It was time for my yearly hormone check, and I traveled to Ohio last year to the Hormone Cottage (I found through Suzanne Somers website) so this year it was just over the phone.  My estrogen (all 3) were below the chart.  Like my Estradiol is .93, Estriol 1.3, Estrone 8.  Cortisol, DHEA, Testosterone, and Progesterone all within range.   She said my ovaries have stopped working and I am in menopause.  I was shocked.  I was having regular-ish periods until just a few months ago!  However the worst thing she said was she didn't see how I could be having any of my symptoms based on my lab results.  Only the hot flashes or night sweats would be from the low estrogen.  That can't be true.  I mean, my body quite literally slammed into menopause very quickly and very early.  Wouldn't it be normal to feel quite awful and out of sorts?  She seemed almost reluctant to give me estrogen like what is the point.  I had to insist.  She also said to take my progesterone at a steady level all month (I was cycling before).  I asked if I could still cycle to try to get periods, and she said no my body was done with my ovaries? I just would love some insight on my symptoms and some reassurance that I will have some relief once I begin taking the estrogen.  She will be giving me estradiol and estriol.  Its quite the blow...is it bad to have menopause this early?  I just feel like i've been thrown into the old lady category overnight.  I just had to get used to being not in my 30's, now this??  Thanks for your responses, I look forward to some more compassion and understanding!"

Tried Maca, tried Black Cohosh and then one day had a brain wave I had a small eucalyptus type balm in my bag (a strong smelling one) that one usually uses for a blocked nose and I had the thought to try it for when I get a hot flash.  It works!!! Because it smells so cooling it’s like my senses trick my body and the heat that was rising stops, and I then stop thinking about it and before I know it, the hot flash got stopped in it’s tracks.  It feels like a mini miracle and I now feel like I am back in control of this.  Hope this works for you."

They have been kept under control for the past two years through a supplement that I have been taking.  But, a new symptom has reared it's ugly head.  Terrible dizzy spells and lightheadedness; feeling like I am going to faint when a hot flash occurs.  One episode happened while I was driving (I seriously thought I was having a stroke) and the other was today at work.  It was so bad at work I had to have my hubby come and get me.  I did not feel like I could drive.  I have been to the doctor and as they said they have ruled out the baddies, heart, stroke, etc.  Now I am having blood work done on Tuesday. None of my friends have experienced this in peri-menopause so I feel like I am crazy.  Is this all in my head or have any of you suffered this too?

I've seen my doctor a few times, blood work says Im in perfect heath. Ive excercised, stopped drinking coffee and quit smoking 2 years ago, ate health, suppliments. Ive tried 2 types of antidepressants, one only worked for awhile, the second one was prozac and it made me worse. My Doctor just precribed me a 3Rd one but Im not going to try it as now Im afraid of ehat it will do. I went on sick leave from a long term job last year and when sick leave ran out I quit, Im single so I need to work, I have a new job starting next week but I question if I can actually do it, but will make myself push through as I don't want to loose my house. I've really tried, I know it's hormones and I try to practice gratefulNess and positive words....but inside I feel so negative and those thoughts really get to me, I feel like Im a horrible mean person...although I rarely let those words out, if something really upsets me I have exploded a couple of times. Im sorry I hate complaining as Im aware there is way worse things in the world and I feel very guilty to feel so negative.....I just really miss the happy side of me which only comes out rarely now.

sarah86682,2018-03-16T22:30+00:00,Am I in perimenopause?,"Hi. I'm a newbie on here.  I had my last baby 7yrs ago when I was 40.  Since then my periods have been very inconsistent. I'll go months with them being regular then I'll bleed for 3 weeks constantly, then I'll bleed every other week. I've had scans, blood tests, etc done and everything comes back fine.  My moods fluctuate. I'll be fine for a while, then I'm snappy and irritable with everyone.  In the last 6 months I have been waking in the night sweating and for the last 2 weeks I've had awful problems getting to sleep when I go to bed or if I wake in the early hours.  My most recent 'symptom' has been my self esteem. I'm so low. I feel so useless and worthless. I feel invisible....Its like no one is interested in anything I have to say anymore.....or am I so hypersensitive that it just feels that way to me?  I'm short tempered with my kids, then I feel like I'm a failure as a mum.  And I feel so lonely. My partner is no support at all. He complains that I'm irritable and moody, tells me to cheer up etc but wont listen when I try and talk to him about how I feel.  I have very few friends and they are all mums from my daughters school who are a good 10yrs younder than me so have no idea what I'm talking about.  i have days where I just want to run away. Some days I want to tell my partner to clear off and let me just be alone, other days I just want him to hug me and tell me he loves me and is there for me.  I know I should exercise and eat healty, but even that is all too much effort right now.  I have spoken to doctors, but all they say is ""its your age I'm afraid, its to be expected""  Oh and pains in my breasts......thats been happening a lot more recently too.  I'm so glad I've found this. I'm hoping talking to others who may understand how I'm feeling will help. I need to feel more positive but I just dont know how right now.  Sorry for waffling on. I'm normally a fun happy go lucky person....honest!"

trinity03,2018-03-06T14:36+00:00,Perimenopause panic,"I'll be 43 very soon, and I've been experiencing what I think are perimenopause symptoms since December and it's been torturous. Some symptoms have improved since starting an SSRI anti-anxiety med, but the physical symptoms remain. Symptoms: Overwhelming dread, fear, panic, frustration, anger, and sadness. I had NO appetite and barely ate. EVERYTHING overwhelmed me. Just the thought of having to make dinner sent me into a panic-y meltdown. I had bills to pay, but just couldn't leave to go pay them. Thank God for online bill pay! *This all started right before Christmas, so obligations were more frequent and I had to hold it together as best I could.  The day after Christmas I shut down. I could barely get out of bed and just laid there sobbing, shaking, and physically in pain. I felt adrenaline CONSTANTLY coursing through my veins and had to keep moving to ""burn it off"". I lost about 7 pounds 3 weeks and it doesn't sound like much, but I'm already small and the weight loss was very noticeable and concerning. I'd fall asleep fine but wake up with heart palpitations and racing pulse, several times a night. I almost went to the ER several times. For about a month I thought I was dying. I was-and still am experiencing: random muscle cramping, muscle spasms, tendon and joint pain, skin tingling, itching, blurry vision, jitters, buzzing and internal vibrations when sitting still and trying to sleep, and fibrocystic breast pain. * I saw my doctor a few weeks after this started and it wall all chalked up to my untreated anxiety disorder, which made sense. So, I've been taking generic Lexapro and it's cleared my head and helped me focus. I haven't had any bouts of crying and despair, BUT the physical symptoms are just as prevalent and leading me to believe I'm starting perimenopause. My aunt told me that ""the change"" starts early on that side of the family and that she started in her late 30s. My mom had a hysterectomy at 22, so I couldn't use her as a reference.  My period last month was a week early, I'm starting to find long, fine hairs on my jawline. My breasts look like deflated balloons, and I haven't had a libido for over a year. I also had 2 hot flashes last week. I'm seeing my gynecologist on Thursday and hopefully she can give me some insight to this. *Sorry this is so long. I needed to vent and find some kind of camaraderie in all this. I am just so over these muscle spasms and internal buzzing. I want my life back and to feel ""normal"" again."

I have several serious health issues including poor mobility and severe fatigue. However 7 years ago I had a three week period where all my pain vanished and I couldnt stop moving. I repainted our whole 3 bed bungalow and our garage. Built a new cupboard for our gas bottles and relandscaped the garden. Then I crashed again and went back to constant pain, poor mobility, not sleeping and some nasty funny turns called vasavagel attacks where blood pressure drops through floor, your heart stops, you stop breathing etc. My partner is a trained first aider and saved my life more than once. It never happened again until now. Woke up this morning and could hardly walk due to severe pain and stiffness. By lunchtime I was buzzing. Have totally cleaned the bathroom even every nook and cranny and cant slow down. Has anyone else ever experienced this as part of this damn awful process? I'd love to hear from you if you have.

I now suffer with constant head pressure and tingling, fatigue, intrusive thoughts/worry that I'm going crazy, my mood is very low during my periods. My periods have changed. Sometimes they are heavy, sometimes lighter and closer together. I'm losing hair rapidly and my ankles are swelled with really thick skin and I have bad acne on my chin and jawline. I also really struggle with concentration and feel like I'm on auto pilot. Do you think this could be perimenopause? Have you suffered similar symptoms?

It started quite light but then for two weeks it was very very heavy with flooding and clots and was just soaking through pads and tampons. It then reduced to 'normal' period heaviness but when I was still bleeding after 3 weeks I saw GP. She gave me some progesterone to help stop the bleeding but then it became significantly lighter so I didn't take it. Dr also referred me for a scan (i'm still waiting for the appointment to come through.) I then had lighter bleeding and some days dark brown discharge.  But last night very heavy bleeding started again. Very sadly my lovely husband has life limiting cancer and I am quite anxious generally at the moment - but ive also got scared that there is something serious wrong with me (and the impact on our children.) Sorry this is so long but would love to hear from people with any similar experience.

Signs and symptoms,"I know it’s easy to self diagnose and get it wrong so I was wondering if anyone had any confirmed symptoms of early menopause that might explain my changes? I’m 38 but have noticed changes over the past couple of years. 1) flooding and clotting during periods. Mentioned this to the clinic nurse and she said that this was common in the “decade before menopause” and suggested the coil. I’ve had these for at least 2 years and none of my friends of the same age have this problem. I have to double up on sanitary wear, sleep on a towel in leggings and always always wear black clothes.  2) inability to lose weight / and weight gain, despite a better diet than ever! 3) this is the worse one - very tearful for no reasons, feeling like I have no control over my life, completely overwhelmed and stressed. I used to get PMT for a couple of days during ovulation but now this comes on at any stage and can last for days on end. I’m angry at everyone all the time -panic attacks have also become a new feature!  this is all completely out of character, I feel as though I am a different person 😢  I’m worried about going to the dr because I know I’ll cry, and what if he says nothings wrong!"

About 2 months ago I started having major pressure in my pelvic region. I went in because I thought it maybe a UTI. It's so uncomfortable! Then I started my period. I went to an OBGYN who did an ultra sound and found a cyst 2.0 mm on one ovary. small ones on the other and 2 small fibroids. She wants me to wait until the end of April take the mini pill for my periods that are coming every 2 weeks. Sometimes the pain is very severe and so uncomfortable! Im ok when I'm not bleeding but when it starts its painful. Im really debating on the mini pill since I do smoke. Im trying to quit. I've also put on weight that I can't seem to lose even tho Im on a Keto diet. And the anxiety that pops up sometimes! Anyone else go through this

Since my last period, I have had pelvic discomfort which comes and goes and then terrible bloating and indigestion. Again this is worse with what I eat (anything nice!) and improves slightly if I barely eat anything other than bananas and yoghurt. My doctor is referring me for an ultrasound and a C125 blood test to rule out ovarian cancer but has told me not to worry or be alarmed. With bloating on and off going on for two weeks now, I'm sure the worry and the anxiety are feeding it! Anyone else having these issues?"

Most recently I had some bloodwork and CTs and will have a doppler on my abdominal artery. They got the CTs back today and will go over them with me tomorrow. However, the dr's office called me today and told me that I'm ""in menopause""....I'm quite confused about how/why she would have said this, unless it was STRICTLY based on my symptoms. However, I have no uterus (and therefor no cycles for the last 4 years) and the most recent bloodwork did not include hormone levels. The last hormone level test I had was last july and my FSH was 8.1 I'm just wondering with everything I've read about the perimenopause lasting 4 years n such, is it even POSSIBLE for my FSH to have elevated that high that fast? I'm even beginning to wonder if maybe they called the wrong patient. I was so busy with my stepdaughter today, I wasn't very focused.  Thank you all for any input."

The headache is gone now, thanks to Tylenol and prescription nasal spray for congestion, but the cough persists, and I woke up early this morning having a panic attack.  Now, I'm at work, still coughing, trying to figure out why the cough is making me panic??!  I had a little spotting this morning, too, so I'm not sure if I'm trying to start a period.  Feeling very down about things, too, and between the headache, the cough, the weather, and the peri, I spent most of yesterday in bed.  The good thing about being at work is being around other people, but I keep having to remind myself to breathe, that the cough can be treated and the panic will go away eventually.  I am getting paranoid that the cough is something bad even though it's gone on for days with this crazy weather.  Stupid peri!"

amanda59745,2018-03-01T15:23+00:00,"Don,t know if i should see my GP?","Hi i have had irregular periods for just over 2 years i am 47 this month. I have several symptoms of peri, no flushes though. I am suffering from health anxiety so my GP told me back in August last year as i had attended the surgery 4 or 5 times in the previous months starting June same year. Neck pains, sinus problems,hearing problems, nausea and anxiety. During this period i was weaning off of amitriptyline a drug i had been taking for nerve pain. I believe this drug made me experience some of the symptoms. Anyway my Gp said not i have health anxiety. I have had muscular neck, shoulder and upper back pain since June last year. I have had massage's, done yoga which made my neck worse and i ended up with clavicle and jaw pain. I then had 3 months of physio  which ended  29th December with little improvement. I was discharged from physio as my lower back had been pulled and i was on many drugs diazapam, naproxen cocodamol for this so my neck did not seem as bad. As soon as my lower back was better and i stopped the drugs BANG my neck problems returned. I had read on here and via google  that muscle problems like stiffness aches and pains  can be a peri/menopause symptom due to high estrogen levels and low progesterone levels.  Please has anyone had anything simular and for so long? i am trying to keep my anxiety levels low but  my muscle problem is moving down my back i have a strange sensation like  in my mid back on the right feels like the muscle is bulging slightly next to my spine it is not sore but twitchy. I know this sounds strange but that's what it feels like. I have been going swimming once a week for the last month and feel better for this.  My whole back clunks when i roll my shoulder and i feel like i have several small knots under my left shoulder blade and have been using a tennis ball to try and help move these but this is vey very painful.  I have also had random aches in between some of my ribs. I am not sure what to do should i go and see my GP again? i fear they will just say health anxiety again but, i am worried this has gone on a long time. Has anyone taken any supplements that have helped with back /neck muscle  pain?"
tina67303,2018-02-28T22:46+00:00,Supplement suggestions?,"Hi All!  A little bit about what I am currently experiencing: - I will be 47 this year - I still have regular periods - For the last 3 months I've been feeling some health anxiety.  I keep thinking something is wrong with me because my body is telling me that something is definitely wrong.   - Occasionally I will feel nauseous and/or dizzy - I have occasional heart palpitations - I sometimes have night sweats.  I wake up and my chest is drenched in sweat.  Sometimes at night when the husband cops a feel his hand will be all wet. (Serves him right ;-) - My cheeks (on my face, not butt) will get flushed like I ate some MSG.   - I'm not a very good baker. - I have no rhythm whatsoever and dance like Elaine from Seinfeld. *  The last two aren't really peri-menopause symptoms but I'm adding them What are some of the supplements that you've been recommended and how fast did it take to see results, if any? Thanks!"
al37045,2018-02-28T14:41+00:00,Ferritin Levels,I’m just wondering whether my symptoms of tiredness and dizziness are anything to do with low iron. I’ve been anaemic on and off since my 20’s as I have heavy periods. My last blood tests show that my Hg level was normal (therefore not anaemic) but my ferritin was at 25. The ‘normal’ range for ferritin in 12-150 for a woman.  So I am deemed ‘normal’. A few doctors have suggested over the years I should get my levels to about 50. Does anyone else have low ferritin and did your symptoms improve when you increased your ferritin levels?

It’s sooooo weird. I’ve had it happen on both sides today. Feel okay other than completely wacky digestion...LOADED with gas. Gotta love that tmi lol But seriously, just constant gurgling and some stomach pain, up into my shoulder and gurgle more, a little pain in the shoulder and back now and then, and then WINDDDDDD lol. So aside from that this weird short quick stabbing pain comes and goes on the hip/upper leg area. I AM definitely ovulating because I felt those lovely pains today too.

It would really benefit my research to collect some information from women that have gone through // going through it. So here is what i'm looking into:  I want to give women the power and control over heat fluctuations, therefore I am looking at designing a range of clothes using smart textiles to regulate body heat.  What are peoples thoughts on this?  Any personal stories on heat fluctuations that could be shared would be extremely helpful. Or even advice on if this would be beneficial to women going through menopause.  I would really appreciate any comments // negative or positive to get some research from potential users. Thank you!"

This started last summer on and off and I still get it. I am 48 and in the middle of peri and have most of the symptoms going, but this one is odd. Out of nowhere I can feel like I am coming down with the flu with the aching and shivery bones and then it goes again often within the same day or the next day. For a while I thought it was related to ovulation time and premenstrual time, but then sometimes it happens randomly as well. I saw my GP about it and was checked out for everything including infection, inflammation, thyroid, autoimmune illnesses, HIV and Hepatits (just because she was at a loss) and everything is normal. I was also checked for UTI’s, but it isn’t that either. Does anyone else at all get this? Thanks"

Guest,2018-02-24T04:07+00:00,Trouble with keeping things in perspective?,"Everything seems like a big deal now.  The smallest things bother me.  I know it’s the peri and anxiety, but I can tell I’m annoying to other people.  I feel this way especially at work, like I’m not as good at my job as I used to be.  I don’t have the career that my parents hoped I would, or I hoped for.  Nothing seems good enough, like somehow I missed out on life.  I used to be so hopeful and now it’s so hard to try to do better.  It doesn’t help that I work with college students who make me feel old and slow.  I can’t seem to get a healthy perspective on my life anymore.  Anyone else?  I keep thinking I can just push through this, but I don’t know how much longer I can go without getting professional help with my anxiety.  It is ruining everything."
leslie95604,2018-02-26T14:17+00:00,BHRT Dilemma,"I've been working for three months with a reputable women's clinic in Ohio to get onto BHRT. I reside in Washington state, 3000 miles away. I completed the expensive state of the art testing offered by this clinic back in early Jan. 2018. Had to wait 2 weeks for results. 2 additional weeks for doctors to review test results and formulate a prescription based on my specific lab results. Ohio is restricted from sending compounded prescriptions over state lines so they sent the specific recommendations to a local compounding pharmacy in my area to manufacture my prescription. The local pharmacist received the recommendations but my gyn had to give final approval before they could be compounded. The local pharmacist sent over the prescription for approval and 3 days later the gyn left for a week's vacation without signing off on my BHRT prescription -The very day I was supposed to pick up my prescription. I went into the gyns clinic and raised hell. A fat nurse had the audacity to tell me that I would have to just take anti anxiety medication until the gyn returned from his vacation! My husband was livid! He demanded that they find a doctor to sign off on the prescription THAT DAY! The other gyn on staff at this office was notified and she signed off on the prescription. We were able to pick it up later that afternoon. We drove to the compounding pharmacy to pick up the BHRT and was once again facing incompetence. I was supposed to receive transvaginal BHRT as that is what was recommended by the doctors in Ohio, but the local compounding pharmacist decided to switch to transdermal and also tweaked the formula. I received the prescription and was unaware it had been altered from the original recommended formula. I began using the transdermal cream as directed and by the evening of the second day I began to itch all over my body. I called the pharmacy and found out the formula was not as per the recommended formula. I then called the clinic in Ohio and talked with the gal who has been working with me from the beginning. She said it is highly likely something in the transdermal cream that I am reacting to and that's exactly why they formulate BHRT transvaginally to avoid this potential problem. The clinic in Ohio has been treating women and men with BHRT for over 20 years and have perfected the treatment. I should have just flown to frigging Ohio and picked up the correct recommended prescription directly from them. Now, today, Monday, I have to contact the local compounding pharmacist who made my prescription wrong and discuss how we are going to rectify this situation. I am so done. So done. I have been suffering debilitating symptoms for two years now, literally on the couch or in bed most of the time, and finally get to the day where I can possibly begin to get relief and the whole thing blows up in my face. I am beyond p****d off. Two weeks ago I went in for an ultrasound to see what this abdominal mass is that's been sore for the last year and a half. Turns out it's my right kidney! My right kidney dislodged somehow and fell down and sits in my lower abdomen. I am just tired of being a slave to this degrading body."
Catbeag,2018-02-26T16:26+00:00,"Perimenopause, new Mirena, stress...all the above?","Hello, I'm being supported by an excellent GP, but would find it helpful to know about others' experience. I'm 45. In Spring 17, had first UTIs ever--confirmed and treated with nitrofurantoin, plus yeast infection ( no surprise). At same time, began experiencing after-sex and mid-cycle bleeding. Elsewhere in life MIL died suddenly, my own mother was diagnosed with cancer, I got a new job, as did OH (in other part of country, so living apart for first time in 17 years for part of the week). Start of grumpy bowels...lots of flatulence and cramping, but coming and going. 2 (1 tv) ultrasounds clear, but referred for hysterscopy and endometrial biopsy. Happened in December, all clear. Since the end of October, coinciding with my mum's operation, started having more then 1 bm per day. During the week of my mum's surgery, I could barely get through a meal (to put stress levels in perspective, I put wrong fuel in car. Doh). Since then, grumpy bowels and frequency of bms more or less seem to be in line with stress/menstrual cycle. Got Mirena in December. January was ok. Started with indigestion, more flatulence, dodgy bowels (stress at work). Last 2 weeks anxiety has been through roof: dizzy, lightheaded, palpitations, breathlessness, for the past week, burning face. Period is due this week,so no doubt 'helping'. Bit of a health anxious person anyway, but with everything else going on, I keep imagining the worst!(Have been referred to an endocrinologist, bloods normal, waiting stool test results...). Anyone else have similar experiences with Mirena? Similar experience full stop? Thanks for listening!"

dora_39625,2018-02-21T23:04+00:00,HRT and perimenopause,Hi all .. Went to see doctor today as have a very late period- almost 5 weeks now. This is the latest it's been for me. The doctor was very helpful and told me that all symptoms definitely point to perimenopause. Sent me to have some bloods done(awaiting results) and advised I start HRT. This shocked me as last year a different doctor advised not to go down HER root as am far too young for it. (I'm 42) The doctor I spoke to today suggested I read up on HRT first and decide. I was told that at my age I am 50% more likely to develop brittle bones and osteoporosis later on as starting perimenopause quite early. This is why I have to seriously consider HRT. I've always preferred to use natural alternatives when possible and the thought of HRT scares me slightly. Should I be worried? If the pro's outweigh the cons then I would seriously consider taking it. Any advice woukd be greatly received Thanks!

Had hormone test in May 2017 FHS 2.7 , LH 3.2 Oestradiol 3580 Then I had a couple weeks with hot waves and went back to gp to repeat hormone test in Oct17 FsH 85.6 , LH 62.8 , Oestraidiol <50. I'm confused how can be such a large charge in 5 months. I'm worried incase something else has made it the change so quick rather than menopause. I'm having breast and under arm and groin pain.

I felt amazing in less than 24 hours after applying .50 patch. Flashes stopped had energy and depression lifted. I started to really go down hill about 6 months ago. Flashes back, deep depression, no energy or interest in much, etc. changed patch to .75 for 6 weeks with no change in symptoms. Changed patch again to 1.00 for the lad4 weeks. Flashes have improved 60% but still depressed tired wake up at 4:30 am 😳 And have to get up cant sleep.  The highest my estrogen ever has been on patch was 42. I recently had it checked again and its currently 24. Myrogesterone is currently 1.5.  When the flashes returned 6 months ago i upped prog thinking it would help flashes. got it up to 16.5. Backed off it and now its 1.5. I feel terrible and have gained 30 lbs i 1.5 years. Im at a loss. My estrogen level was at 18 before hrt. With no weight gain. Im trying to protect my heart and bones with hrt buy have not achieved a high enough level on hrt to protect me. I wonder if i achieved 42 estrogen level because I still was producing some estrogen myself along with patch until 6 months ago maybe ovary gave out and dropped mr back to 20 level. one more key information. I was smoking heavily and wonder if that had anything to do with absorbtion of patch. I have been non smoking now for 5 weeks. And will never smoke again. Anyways, can you share your thoughts with me on my levels absorbtion and weightgain? Im struggling pretty bad mentally. My memory is shot and i cant concentrate for a whole minute.

julie74885,2018-02-20T21:13+00:00,Just want to know I'm not alone in this nightmare.,"Hi Everyone, I started having night sweats approx 4 years ago, they seemed to follow my cycle and last 4/5 consecutive nights per month. As I got to know they were only temporary I wasn't to adversly affected by them, although these nights were virtualy sleepless and extremely uncomfortable. I did consult my GP and had a blood test and was told I wasn't eligable for HRT as I wasn't then in full menopause. However, things have taken a dramatic turn for the worse. I haven't had a period since November 2017 and about 6 weeks ago the hot Flushes started. I have them day and night, at least one every hour. I can't remember the last time I slept all night. I am so exhausted and I just want to cry all the time. I am also experiencing headaches, nausea, memory loss, confusion and just about every symptom in a severe way. I have a very busy life, I work part time, have 3 sons, 2 step sons, three grandchildren, a husband, oh and a dog. I had to cancel work today because I feel so unwell, so am also upset because I am now letting people down. All I have done today is drag myself out to walk the dog. In a normal day I would be doing a million and one things. I have tried to explain all this to my Husband, who I think tries to understand, but just says, go to bed Honey, if your'e tired, (at 8 o'clock in the evening). I can't even talk to my lovely Mum as I lost her 2 years ago. I don't see my friends very often and none of them have had a bad time of the menopause, so I don't think they realise just how debilitating this is. My children think I'm boring, and I have to ask people politely not to phone after 9 pm as I will be in bed! I am seeing my GP on Thursday and it can't come soon enough. I'm thinking HRT is now the answer and am praying she can help me. I know I'm not the only one going through this, and my sympathys are with everyone sharing my symptoms. Any helpful words of advice would be very gratefully recieved. Julie"
ali80468,2018-02-21T22:00+00:00,Anxiety/menopause,"hi all i have posted a couple of times of this site and I am just probably looking for a little comfort. Partial hysterectomy 6 years ago due to having large fibroid, last year around mid January had health anxiety about my right hand side, kept thinking something was wrong but eventually after taking anti depressants for a few months and diazepam for around 2 weeks I returned to normal - if there is such a thing!  I decided at the end of November 2017 to try hrt (Elleste Solo) due to feeling I needed to pee all the time however come mid January 2018 I began to get discomfort in my left breast, after consulting the dr and a breast consultant (privately) both said nothing amiss with my left breast but again I began to worry and have ended up coming off hrt and I am currently back on citalapram also taking diazepam when required, although the dr was reluctant to give me diazepam.

synaesthAsia,2018-02-16T01:11+00:00,perios every two weeks,"Hi ladies. I am 46, full on postmenopausal. I used to have all sorts of weird symptoms but somehow managed to deal with the psychological, mental aspects after thorough research after and trying different natural herbs, supplements etc. However there is one thing that s been making me panic: For the last 3 months I have periods every 2 weeks without fail. It always comes between the 12th and 14th day of my cycle. It s a bit heavier than spotting (I am guessing) but not really heavy. It lasts for 3 days, which is as long as my normal periods have lasted all the years and it is accompanied by breast tenderness and mild cramps. Had a test pap almost a year ago and blood tests a couple of months ago.  The doctor did not find anything weird but she found an inflammation. She told me that it isn t anything serious and it doesn t require treatment unless I have discharge, which I don' t. I have been googling my symptom (I know, I know it s not good for my head) and although it is listed as (almost) normal peri menopausal symptom, I still find it disconcerting. Has anyone else experienced it? I would appreciate your feedback and experiences until I schedule my next appointment with a gyno and I will keep you posted on the results."

I bought a cream derived from wild yams.  But there is no real consensus on how many days a month to use it. The package says every day. The reviews on Amazon say 3 weeks a month and 1 week off. (I assume the week of my period.)  The pharmacist says the day after my period stops. The naturopath said after ovulation. (No longer easy to predict since my periods in peri- are less regular.) I wondered if I should just calculate 2 weeks after the first day of my period and start then... Any insights?  Thanks!"

I am charting my partner's cycle (she is 47 and into her 5th year of perimenopause.  Seriously - if perimenopause were a person I would murder her in cold menstrual blood) and it seems like she has honestly only had 3 TOLERABLE days this month.  Yep, tolerable - not even good days.  I have found her a vitamin regime that has helped slightly and we have now purchased progesterone cream, due to start this month on day 14.  If that doesn't work I just don't know what to do next.

Whilst on it I was getting the occasional water infection. Just recently I went to my doctor because I was aching so badly. She did an ESR test that came back with raised levels. I had a water infection and was put on antibiotics. It did not go away and my ESR was up again. The doc has now referred me to a urologist and has told me that it might possibly be a tumour on my bladder. I have no blood in my wee and I have no symptoms of an infection. I really don't think it's a tumour but perimenopause. Has anyone had anything similar. Thanks for reading. Helen.

No I am not a fan but I don’t want to struggle anymore. I also have benzos when I fly but been taking them almost every other day just to make it.

jayneejay,2014-10-08T18:59+00:00,Maca root for peri and menopause - useful read ..,"I have used Maca ( rainforest) 5.1 for years..  it was the very first supplement i took in early peri and continued .. heres a very interesting read  its an interview with Hugo Malaspina MD about Maca and Menopause how good it is.. On May 20, 1997, Dr. Hugo Malaspina, who practiced for years as a neurologist before beginning a practice based on complementary medicine involving the use of herbs, agreed to be interviewed by Viana Muller, Ph.D., Founder, Whole World Botanicals on his use of the herb maca(tm) (Lepidiium meyenii/peruvianum) in his practice. VM: How did you first hear about maca? Dr M: The first contact I had with maca was seven years ago. There was a circle of elderly gentlemen, a bit playful, who wanted to maintain their sexual activity. Well, one of them had heard about the properties of maca, and so at their social get-togethers, they began to consume maca together. Within this circle was an 88 year-old gentleman, who had a sexual relationship once a week, and he was able to perform. And they all had their sexual relationships going well, which was notable since they were all above 70 years in age. VM: You have told me that you use maca in your practice for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. What are the benefits of this? Dr M: I can tell you the following: the women who use maca are not going to have peri-menopausal symptoms. I have seen this in many patients, but, of course, that is not enough. What is needed is a double-blind study with a control group. But I am absolutely certain that maca can substitute perfectly for nature herself-or, rather, not substitute but continue nature, because the mechanism of action is simple. Because it is not acting from outside-from introducing something into the body from outside-that is, introducing hormones into the body. In some cases, this may be necessary, but in general-no. It is only necessary to see to it that the ovaries do not completely atrophy. So that the ovaries continue to produce more than the minimum amount of estrogen necessary, in order that we don't run into problems later. And if the ovaries have been removed from the body, so that the adrenal glands can be in the condition to continue to produce the minimum quantity of estrogen necessary to avoid problems. VM: Oh, it works on women who've had hysterectomies? That's important, because I've read that more than one million women in the U.S. have had complete hysterectomies-and they no longer have their ovaries. It's really an abuse of the doctors to so regularly remove a woman's ovaries. Dr M: Yes, that's true. And then it becomes necessary to use hormone replacement therapy, which carried its own risks,and its own economic benefits (for the pharmaceutical companies)! That's why it's difficult to find a scientific group to finance a study of the use of maca in place of hormone replacement therapy. Because the study would kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. There are different medicinal plants that work in different ways on the ovaries-that stimulate them. Maca is one of them, but we should use the word ""regulate"" the ovarian function instead of ""stimulate."" Maca regulates the organs of internal secretion, such as the pituitary, the adrenal glands, the pancreas, etc. VM: What scientific information is available on maca? Dr M: In addition to the information we have from Dr. Chacon, there has also been scientific research from some North American and English scientist who were studying all of the pathologies of people living at high altitudes-that is, about 4,000 meters. These are precisely the people who cultivate maca because this is where maca is grown. Well, they observed that the women there had no post-menopausal problems. Something that they thought was quite exceptional. VM: What types of problems Dr M: The typical problems of hot flashes, depression, osteoporosis, cardiac circulatory problems, etc.-all of the problems are much more evident now than in previous generations, because after menopause women use to live maybe 15 or 20 years more. Now they regularly live another 25 or 30 years more. VM: Do you know how much maca these women were eating? If you translate what they were eating into dry powdered maca, for example, how many teaspoons were they eating? Dr M: Well, one small dried plant root equals about one teaspoon of dried powdered root. Let's say, about one teaspoon 3 times a day. For perimenopausal women-that is, women who are anovulatory. For these women, to use hormones derived from an outside source causes their ovaries to effectively atrophy. Because later they stop producing hormones. The fact that there is a sufficient level of hormones in the blood sends a message to the pituitary and the hypothalamus indicating that there is a sufficient quantity of hormones in the body, and for that reason they can stop producing them. And then when menopause arrives, there is almost a complete atrophy of the ovaries, which means that there is practically an absence of estrogen in the body-which then causes all of these other symptoms. Because the body requires a minimum amount of estrogen and progesterone in the body in order to maintain a functional equilibrium in the body. So, everything has stopped. Then the woman needs a continuous hormone replacement therapy since her own body no longer puts out its own hormones. For this reason, we are giving maca to women who are perimenopausal or who are just starting menopause. Maca from what we have observed of its effects, by the results we have obtained, has a type of stimulating effect on the ovaries- the minimum quantity that is necessary."

nina0702,2018-02-08T12:48+00:00,I'm struggling with depression/menopause and feel like I'm getting nowhere,"I woke up one morning around 7 months ago to the most horrendous depression I could ever describe. It just came like a bolt of lightening from nowhere. I was perfectly happy with no problems at all. I have a lovely family and a great job. The Dr Put me on  Sertralene which over the months made a massive difference apart from I couldn't get to sleep at all. He then put me on Trazodone which helped me sleep but I couldn't function during the day and it started affecting my job and ability to get work as I have to drive there and I was too dizzy to get in the car. Last weekend I felt tearful and put it down to my period being due but then started to feel really angry towards the slightest things which is not like me. Two days ago I woke up again and I felt that horrendous depression starting again. The GP has told me to stop the Trazodone and start with a different anti-depressant. I am positive that this is not just general depression though. I am 50 yrs old and have been experiencing night sweats, palpitations , difficulty sleeping,aches and pain especially in my neck and upper spine, difficulty concentrating and a 4 week pattern to my emotions. I am convinced this along with the depression is due to the peri-menopause and not down to mental health issues. I am desperate to find the correct medication and way to treat this. This isn't just a moan about getting older and feeling a bit down. Today I feel like it's 'lifted' a little. Whether or not that was going to happen anyway or it's because I stopped the Trazodone last night - I don't know. Very confused. If anyone can relate to this then I would appreciate some replies."
tara60627,2018-02-06T19:51+00:00,In peri-menopause and need support,"Hi all. I'm 45 and have had symptoms of perimenopause for the last 4 years. I'm looking forward to menopause so this hell will end. I was in denial of perimenopause until recently when I finally accepted it. I cried non-stop for a week not wanting to accept that my young fertile body is no more. I'm single, never married, and i haven't been on a date for over 2 years since my ex broke up with me and broke my heart. He couldn't handle being with someone who was going through perimenopause. But at the time I didn't know it was perimenopause, I just thought I was crazy, maybe clinically depressed. I had and still have horrible pms, insomnia, and night sweats. The week before my period all those symptoms are at their worse. I'm feeling very alone, none of my friends are going through this. And the people at work are very unsupportive and don't understand. I have a mortgage and I'm terrified of losing my job and then losing everything. I even think of horrible thoughts of suicide if I were to lose my job. I don't think I would but I'm so alone and just feel hopeless. I only work 30 hours a week and can barely do that. I come to work sometimes on only 3 or 4 hours of sleep and look and feel horrible. I'm incredibly anti-social since I can't sleep and am always tired. I have old friends contact me that are in town and need a place to stay but I hide away and lie to them about how busy I am because I don't want anyone to stay here because I already can't sleep and am so sensitive to noise how would I be able to sleep with a house guest. I feel bad about lying to friends but I'm so desperate for sleep and I don't think they'd understand. I'm now taking lots of b vitamins, vitamin e, evening primrose oil, vitamin c, and i get a lot of sun so my d levels should be fine. I guess I'm just trying to suffer through it. I'm scared I'll be alone forever. 2 years ago my dad passed away and I've never had a single friend hug me. I need a shoulder to cry on so badly. I miss my dad. I miss my boyfriend. I'm so sad and depressed."

Periods last 10-16 days. Unpredicatable cycles, anywhere from 2 weeks between periods up to 3 months. I have tried diet, I have tried various supplements. Latest try was progesterone cream which did seem to help. Doc decided to do tests. I had all kinds of blood work done, an edo biopsy, a pelvis ultrasound. finds were that I have 2 very small fybroids and one tuiny cyst, all blood work was good. Doc wants to consider surgery and has suggested a endometrial ablation. However, I have done some research and I am not encouraged. many women who have had  endometrial ablation  have found that the poroceedure did not do as they had wished and many ended up having a hysterectomy. My doctor today told me that many women end up having hysterectomies becasue nothign will stop their bleeding. I am wanting some input. Have you had a endometrial ablation? What was your outcome? Hysterectomy? Was it a good choice? Was your doc hesitant? Mine says they like to keep the organs if possible. Is there any way that more blood work can be done to predict the end? Any helpful advise would be appreciated. If you ahve found something that works please let me know."

None of us are crazy, just miserable! 😄  I am convinced that if we have had these intense symptoms as younger women peri meanpsuse just exsasobates them. You ladies are courageous. Not easy living with all of  this. There is good news though. After hitting perimanapause I started praying because I just felt like I couldn’t live like this anymore. I started researching natural treatments because this is my prefrence. Ran into a product called MACAFEM online.  All natural Macca root. Used everywhere in Europe. Many many incredible testimonies. I had nothing to loose.  My migraines and cramps were laying me out for days. Gave me my life back. Most  everything disappeared completely or most certainly lessened significantly. I was able to function again. Symptoms were relieved. Please look into it. It changed my life!  It really works! Praying for all of you and thankful to offer hope!"

Str8tfans,2018-02-04T23:34+00:00,After eating......anyone else?,"Does anyone else feel less well AFTER they eat?  I’ll explain...sometimes I think it’s reflux and other times not sure. I’ve really been tracking how I feel and yes, since Peri started I have more digestive issues like most of us. Sometimes I’ll get some chest paid (assuming reflux, and a Zantac takes it away...) Most other times it’s like....my head will get that “heavy/thick” feeling and anytime that happens the palpitations will start- you know...that wonderful feeling of “is my heart beating too fast? Why do I feel my neck thumping? Is this a heart attack”......and THEN I’ll feel IT....”IT” being my stomach start gurgling, some gas moving around.....and either a lovely (<<<sarcasm cuz, you know- TMI lol) passing of it OR a blower movement and not too long after either of those happens, the icky feelings of panic and heart palps will eventually subside for  a bit. Now....I DO notice that I get this way if I DONT eat at all too, (which also makes you gassy) and I notice in the mornings if I make a healthy organic shake at least within two hours of being awake, my day will be better until like around 3. If I haven’t eaten yet again by then it goes bad again.  Does any of this make sense to any of you? I “almost” want to say most of these symptoms for me  are digestive related, but low and behind you KNOW our friend Peri isn’t gonna actually allow me to “figure it out”.....that’s not how she plays the game with us is it lol"

With medication and therapy I was able to get to a better place each time.  Had a stressful but fulfilling career, and through the tough points I was always able to continue working.

Had a gynecologist test my hormones (thinking maybe at this age the hormone fluctuations can have something to do with this - especially since I feel so much worse right before and during my menstrual cycle.) Was told my hormones are showing pre menopause but nothing out of the ordinary for my age. Only option with great risk would be a birth control pill to help regulate my hormones and menstrual cycle.

I have been able to start taking a Vitamin D supplement again as recommended by my GI doctor (2,000 IU) - it's a different brand and is not causing trouble so far - had to stop before because of dry mouth.  Over the last couple of months, I've been eating a more balanced diet, as balanced as I can get it with Crohn's and peri, getting lots of exercise and more sleep, and have lost a little weight.  I am hopeful that things will be closer to normal this time, but as usual, health anxiety is making me think the absolute worst.

Mayfly1,2017-11-14T11:04+00:00,I have suddenly become depressed,"Good morning all I believe I began the menopause some time ago, as my periods stopped about 6 months back, and I have had the hot flushes for a while.  Basically, I have had no other symptoms – or so I thought. Just recently, someone has moved in to the flat downstairs, and I am aware of his television.  It has made me resentful in a way which is bordering on the extreme.  It has sent me into a pit of depression, which resulted in my going to the doctor and obtaining some anti-anxiety pills.  I took half a tablet one Friday but did not realise I am supposed to take them continuously.  Come Monday morning, I could not stop bursting into tears.  I have had depression before but this is the worst ever.  I feel disconnected from the world, I can’t see any hope for the future, everything is dark and not worth looking forward to.  I normally love Christmas but I can’t see myself living until then because I am so depressed.  I have been to the doctor who confirmed she believes I am in the menopause.  So what I would like to know is : why am I feeling the depression now and will HRT really relieve the amount of depression I am feeling?  I have looked at other symptoms people described and I think I have been experiencing these without really knowing it.  For example, I am off balance a lot of the time, I have come close to collapse sometimes – just a feeling of not being able to stand up, total exhaustion (I work two jobs so I put it down to that) and I also have the urinary incontinence – fortunately, it’s not been too bad, it’s controllable, I’m just aware of it.  But this is the first time the depression has been so bad, I am having problems controlling it.  I really would like to know that I will feel more as though life is worth living and hopefully, that my neighbour is not this awful person deliberately putting his telly on to annoy me.  I want to reconnect with the world, I feel it’s happening around me but I’m not part of it.  I keep doing stuff just to try and make a mark on it. I honestly feel like I'm going mad"

Darryn99931,2018-01-28T12:48+00:00,Is it menopause destroying my relationship?,"just over 12 months ago my wife began accusing me of constantly arguing with her over every little thing. Heaven help me if I tried to say I wasn't arguing. She seems to criticise everything I say or do, calling me an idiot, a d******d, an argumentative drama queen, etc etc. It seriously messes with my head because I know I do tend to defend my actions with reasoning, but as soon as I try to explain my reasons she cuts me off, never letting me finish and shouting at me to stop arguing!? I will wait for her to stop and calmly try to explain my reasoning behind my actions but she cuts me off before I can get three words out. Two nights ago I fell very sick from heatstroke. I had been working in the sun all afternoon without drinking water and got so sick I couldn't move without feeling like throwing up. She claimed I was being a drama queen and intentionally got sick to get attention off her! I forced myself to move and help her with a job she was doing, and even when i did end up throwing up she thought I had stuck my fingers down my throat to be sick on purpose! ... if only because I was seriously in a bad state. Tonight she angrily called me an idiot and I reacted with my own anger and walked out. She is just over 50 and I am wondering if she is getting menopausal. My adult son has told me I make her worse because I put up with the abuse instead of leaving her. He reckons I need to leave so she gets the message but I promised her I would never leave her (she is pretty co-dependant). i don't want to leave, not just because I gave my word, but because she is my soul mate, my angel and I love her dearly. God knows she has put up with me all these years as well. But it is now at the point where I don't know how much more I can take. I have seriously contemplated suicide after a couple of the worse heartbreaking insults and bouts of abusive mind-f*cks. Of course, I cannot go ahead because that would also break my word to never leave her. I have mostly gotten through the fights by agreeing with her, taking the blame for the arguing, even though any logical person would see I was not to blame and often not even arguing.

LindaJaney,2018-01-26T23:03+00:00,Please help ;(,"I was doing better for a few months and actually told myself that the doctors were right.  I'm not in perimenopause and my symptoms were 'viral.  Then in September it all came back and I crashed!!!  Insomnia, anxiety, bloating, weight loss, constipation, extreme breast pain, spotting...you name it. I am a mess.  I just keep getting sent for ultrasounds and told I have IBS and anxiety.  But it is so much worse.  I am almost afraid to go to the NP at this point as she shoves so many anti-anxiety meds at me and calls me 'non-compliant' for not taking them.  She tried to get me to take an anti-psychotic!!!.  I'll be 46 this year - uni educated, successful family business, 3 high achieving kids, no history of psychosis...I've made it to this age successfully but the medical system assumes I'm suddenly psychotic and my hormones are fine.  It's a nightmare. ?My bloating, constipation, shortness of breath, shakiness and insomnia have been awful for 2 weeks.  If I don't sleep I think I will actually go crazy soon. I am afraid to take anything.  Melatonin makes my insomnia worse. Chamomile and valerian don't even touch it.  If I take a 50mg gravol I get about 4 hours. I have lavender capsules but am afraid to take one in case it does nothing and then I can't take a gravol.  My health anxiety is so high and i'm scared of taking anything at this point. I'm using an alpha stim that was helping for a few months but now does nothing I was put on benzodiazepines and they were fresh hell.  I tossed them all. ?I think it is really bad right now because I just started my period, so for the past couple weeks my estrogen has dropped to nothing.  I've heard lavender is estrogenic so don't know if the capsule would help or hurt. My husband has taken them a few times and they knocked him out.  I'm unable to even clean up around the house...I'm just an exhausted zombie.  I've actually had to hire a girl to come and help a few times a week - like home care!!  It's that bad.  She starts tomorrow and is going to think she's working for a mad woman. ?Please let me know if anyone tried the lavender capsules and if they helped.  And how long you can have insomnia before dying??"

So I go back on my profile and and look at my “created posts” and realize I do this like every month. Anywhere from 22-26 days apart!  If that doesn’t tell me hormones are at fault here idk what does!  So today will suck, and I’ll probably start my period today or the next day or two...... Gotta love being a woman right?!

I can handle the flashes but the insomnia is very disturbing. I got off Ambian (mg) a few months ago  because I actually think it was making things worse. I’m aiming to reclaim my sleep without meds. So, I’m seeing a cognitive therapist , do yoga, accupuncture , etc. Things are improving compared to a year ago but not where I want to be. I sleep soundly only 3 hrs before awakening to go to the bathroom and then the brain is wide awake and can’t easiky go back to sleep. I sometimes do get back to sleep but will wake again an hour later. A good night is 3 wakeups. A bad one is 4 Or 5. Anyone else experiencing the insomnia part of menopause  . How common is it? Will this ever end?"

I’ve just had bloods done and had a trans against pelvic scan and all is normal.  My periods are out the window! Only had three last year but just have this continuing pain which does come and go but it’s really getting me down - does anyone else suffer from this when periods are sporadic? Would love some reassurance as my doctor thinks I’m mad and being over treated! Ps: when I got my last period, the pain went for about 3 weeks but now it’s back - the guy who did my pelvic scan said I only had very few follicles left on the ovary and that this last period could be the last hurrah (as he put it) but why the continuing pain?

I have to now go on stage 2 monitoring, any more time off and I'm sacked.I also suffer with insomnia and have found when I have a bad bout of it I'm usually unwell as I get run down.Could this be all to do with menapause as if it is I can now go to my manager and try to explain the reasons why iv been so unwell.Sorry for the rambling I hope it makes sense.Also dr has gave me some hrt patches as my anxiety and palpations ECT is unbearable but I'm a bit reluctant to take them especially if iv been in menapause for a while and have sort of got through some of it without.Is there anything anyone can recommend for insomnia, anxiety, more energy.Thanks in advance, really need some help."

I bought an exercise bike, started measuring my food portions, and cut out all the extra sweets I was eating.  I have been at this for about two months and I look and feel better already.  I have lost 10 pounds.  Having been about as far down as I could go with anxiety and depression, it is a relief to be doing what I can to make things better.  I am also back to taking the 2,000 IU of Vitamin D daily that my GI doctor prescribed.  I tried a different brand that is working out with no side effects so far.  Still haven’t found a new gynecologist yet.  Since I have Crohn’s disease as well, I want my GI doctor to advise on the Vitamin B12 lab results from my testing with the gyn that she could not explain, so I sent him the report and will see him next week.  It is a relief to be taking real steps forward.  I didn’t think I could do it.  I take it all a day at a time now and it is making a real difference."

I started taking the 1.25 mg every other day.  The first day I didn't take I got so angry about something minor and couldn't get out of the mood for hours.  It's not like me at all.  I am going to check with the pharamcist today about cutting it back but it's only been 5 days and I am developing a down mood and who cares attitude.  I am on Effexor and it really helps me with hot flashes.  Either one of these drugs I find are so hard to come off.  Our bodies get so used to it that they go haywire if they don't have it.  I once found a website but can't remember the name of it where it listed 31 signs of menopause... it was the best list I ever saw... so just google 31 signs of menopause.

In recent weeks I've been waking every morning (and sometimes in the night too) with a trembly feeling inside my stomach and tingling, fullness and slight trembling in both of my arms. I have adrenalin surges too where I wake up suddenly with a start. I also have neck, shoulder and upper back aching. I've read that these 'internal shakes' can be part of peri but I'm having a panic today thinking it's something worse. When I get up in the morning my body feels like jelly, I get tingly feelings and cold flushes and I've been having anxiety, low mood and panic attacks too. Sometimes I feel spacey and just not part of the world, so on edge. Has anyone else had any of these symptoms? I'm feeling alone wth it today. I know I'm in perimenopause because I have other symptoms but these symptoms are so new and strange and the anxiety and low mood have been overwhelming and made me feel like a different person. Does anyone else feel like they have kind of lost themselves? Sorry if that sounds weird. I'm just having a challenging day with all this. I get so anxious about more serious causes and that makes it all worse. I'm taking vits and St John's Wort and the occasional valium when I get really panicky. It's helped quite a bit but I still don't feel 'normal'. I just want to feel like ME again."

I went through a very bad hormone imbalance at the same time I had a bout of chronic sinusitis and my last period before full blown menopause!! It took a year and a half of pure heck to finally get figured out that my hormones were keeping me so extremely feeble with crashing fatigue 24/7! It was so horrible and I never heard of anything like it before. Anyways, I started a low dose of HRT a month ago, and now just started doubling that dose. I am feeling SO much better already!! But, I started getting really sore soles of the feet about 10 months ago, and I still have very sensitive parts. My husband knows reflexology, and says my most painful spot is connected to my shoulders. But, I feel fine there. Any ideas..or similar symptoms with anyone?"

sarah39816,2018-01-06T18:51+00:00,So many symptoms! The lastest one is thinning hair....,"Hi, Ladies, It's been a couple months since I've posted to the site, but I faithfully read nearly every post from all these brave ladies.  I saw my doctor a few times over the last several months and after many tests she confirmed that I was in peri due to my symptoms and extremely low hormone levels, especially my estrogen.  I have been in peri for about 5 years per the multitude of symptoms I've experienced.  My dr. advised I was anemic and so I recently finished a course of iron infusions, I was also put on adrenal supplements, vitamin D, magnesium and iron when I have a bleed.  I was also prescribed BHRT, but have had reservations about beginning for fear I might feel worse.  I've had nearly every every symptom on the list and they have all been extremely frustrating.  My latest symptom that has been stressing me is hair loss. My whole life (I just turned 47) I have had very thick, long dark hair.  Over the last few months I have noticed extreme hair shedding.  My hair seems to be lying about everywhere and when I wash it I can literally pull small clumps of long strands as I wash and rinse it.  There's always a a lot of hair in the bottom of the shower and when I comb thru it, it still comes out in alarming (or what feels like alarming) rates.  I know this symptom may seem trite in relationship to so many of the other horrible symptoms, but I just feel freaked out about it.  It is really heightening my already long present anxiety.  I have had my thyroid checked twice over the last few months, results did not warrant prescription thyroid meds at this time.  My question is: are you ladies experiencing this symptom, what are you doing about it, does it slow up and if so, when?  How did you deal with it overall?  I very much appreciate your input.  Thank you."

I was always a great sleeper, and a good sleep was my solution for everything. In peri, namely last two years I felt very sleepy. I was asleep during the day, went to bed early. Not a pleasant thing, but I SLEPT. But this year my sleep pattern changed, and not for good. First strange dreams appeared. Very realistic, and I woke up in confusion where I am exactly. I woke- very unusually for me- early morning, energetic, ready for the day. Then my periods began to change... and my sleep too. Since summer I wake up low, depressed, anxious. Still early morning, in the dark. I need coffee and shower to get ready for the day. Sometimes low mood and anxiety due to my dreams persist until afternoon. My dreams are not real nightmare, but very realistic- about travels, strange cities, me being in a strange land, in a war zone, etc. The worst came during fall. When falling asleep I have every night, only the intensity differ, the scary whoosh feeling/sound in my head. Sometimes also around my upper torso or abdomen. It wakes me up, I am scared, heart beating, palms sweating. Feel like headache is coming. This repeats 3-4 times, usually lessens in intensity, then I finally sleep. Sometimes it goes with jerks in my legs. Not finished yet: I awake up 3-4times at night. Again I wake up with a jerk and whoosh feeling. As if my body and mind could not decide between sleep and waking. And a night grand finale, night sweats! It comes very early morning. My bedroom is 15°C now, at night even less, but I wake up hot, burning, sweating over my body, face and scalp. Terrible anxiety, fears, panick, heart palpitations follow. I try to fall asleep, and if I am lucky I wake up with a jerk and doom and gloom feeling that lifts later, if I am not, my day is spoiled with terrible anxiety. I do not take hrt or other pills. I take iron, and I started with very moderate magnesium, C, B supplements. I walk, do sports, started with meditations last week. And I am really fed up with my bad sleep."

My whole body hurts like when you have a bad flu yet I don't have a fever. Randomly I get hot AND freezing cold simultaneously or one then the other follows. Something seems to be developing inside my throat like a lump. I cry so often I think the strain on my throat muscles is causing it maybe? I did a home test, saliva hormone panel and it revealed that I am super hormonally imbalanced. Barely traceable Estrodiol. Progesterone super low. Testosterone super high. Cortisol way high at night. These past 2 years I have been deteriorating with the last 2 months feeling like my hips are fractured. If you could, see me. I am scared. Year and a half now severe insomnia. Moods are all over the place, but never joyful. I spend most of my time in my houserobe in a recliner perusing Pinterest or doing easy crossword puzzles. What kind of life is this? I can't go into town due to anxiety. This can't be simply hormonal imbalance. I am only 52. Hysterectomy 15 years ago. My hubby tells me he watched his own mom go through the exact same thing. She suffered for two years and then went onto HRT. She found relief. My mom showed no signs of anything like this at all. This, whatever it is, has rendered me so disabled. I have another hormone test being sent to my home from a women's clinic in Ohio called The Happy Hormone Cottage. This is a urine test kit that looks even further into my hormone status. I am taking the steps to get onto BHRT. If anyone else is this bad off I sure would appreciate your comments and reassurance. I have become such an Eyeore! A crippled one at that!"

He is always so phlegmy.  So since it was in the fridge I started drinking some too...and researching all the benefits. Well...4 days in I have no knee pains today...my vaginal odours are gone...and I mean completely gone.  It is also touted to be good for hair and skin...and many other things that are actually peri symptoms if you look it up.  But a glass or two a day...and I am noticing differences.  Just a cheap thing for you all to try for a week or two and see if it makes a difference in your life. On another note...I have been doing very well for about 8 months now...only real symptom has been knee pain and some small anxiety bouts the day before my period.  I find it funny that the anxiety has gone...and it used to be a minute to minute occurrence.  So that in itself has been a real God send. But over Christmas I got hit with some big stressors and went down a rabbit hole for three weeks.  Managed to pull back out after a huge depressive episode...and decided to really change things this year.  I am not taking on any additional stress anymore...shut those feelings off!  lol! Another thing I've noticed over the summer is that the week before my period I get this huge urge to have dinner guests...hahaha...and the day they are coming usually lands right on the day that I start my period, and I am having crying fits before they show up.  So weird!  So now I make sure to keep my mouth shut when I suddenly feel the urge to have company...until I check my calendar.  It really is humorous in it's own way.

And all the women around me who are roughly the same age seem like they are at their over-achieving best. At the same time, I am so over pretending things are normal. I feel terrible--physically and psychologically. More days than not, I can barely drag myself out of bed and get dressed. (Even if I feel OK physically, psychologically I am dying inside from over-work stress and health anxiety.) The good news is, I essentially quit my second job (one more class to teach in the summer) and this winter is my last overtime class at my full time job. I am hoping that helps.  Any strategies for managing perimenopause and work life?  Love you!"
Cforce,2018-01-09T17:38+00:00,Digestion and other symptoms related?? Anyone else?,"Just wondering if anyone else notices this. And if I've posted about this before I apologize...can't remember half the time what I'm complaining about and what I'm not LOL Sometimes, when I start to feel that bad day coming on, (for me it always starts w/an uneasy feeling in my head, sometimes a pain in the back of my head, other times just an ""empty/woozy"" feeling in my head/upper neck area) It always makes me anxious, because even though I should be used to it after like 10 months, I'm not, and of course I think I'm having a stroke or something.  Anyways, when it starts, I get health anxiety immediately. (of course) and then get the feeling that something is in my throat, then comes the woozy vision, can still see fine, but ""feels like"" I'm gonna suddenly not be able to? Does that make sense?? Then the obvious ever presenting palpitations....because you know...#anxiety.... One thing I HAVE noticed though, and sorry for TMI, is that constipation comes often within my cycle, usually after I start my period, and then it'll go away after a day or two. That being said, it's never like a week or something, but just annoying digestion issues.  I'll notice that when I feel this head/throat/anxiety issue, that it'll be accompanied by either a very talkative stomach lol, and/or on the heels of a day or two w/o a bowel movement, and then once the symptoms get really bad....BOOM....there's the missing bowel movement.  After that the symptoms will subside for a little while, maybe 30 minutes or so, then usually come back for a few hours before they subside later in the day.  Does ANYONE relate to this at all?? Also, today is day 5 of my period and it seems to be on it's way out.  Any relation or knowledge about what our hormones are possibly doing on day 5, or the ""end"" of your period?  Just looking for possibly information from anyone who knows about these specific things.  I DO know that ""gut brain health"" are connected. But just looking for any other info if anyone has it.  Hope you're all hanging in there today! It's a semi-rough one for me, last like 8 days. For 3 days before I started, then really bad the first 3 days, then tapered off yesterday, and started again today semi-rough.  SO thankful for all of you here!"

judy65716,2018-01-04T15:23+00:00,B/C Pill and menopause symptoms/placebo week,"I am 54 and have been on and off lutera 20 mg for 8 years.  About 3 years ago my old gyn  who was retiring told me he wouldn't prescribe it for me anymore cause of my age.  I went off for 8 months felt fine, then all hell broke loose.  Long story short I saw new gyn he let me go back on my lutera and I started to feel better.  This was only after going to the e/r 4 times thinking I was having some sort of break down for over two months and dying, seeeing a psychiatrist and being put on 4 different ssri's.  That was made things worse.  Initially no one educated me on how it  could be the menopause.  It was my primary doctor and a endocrinologist after tests and more tests.  After about 8 months of being  back on the lutera I saw another female gyn to see about her opinion on what to take long term. She tested me on the placebo week, 8 th day off and came back post menopause.  She said she didn't treat with hrt and said to just stop taking my pills I didn't need them anymore. I wish she would have told me that to begin with at the initial consult,  I wouldn't have wasted my time. Coincidentally right after that visit, I started to notice toward the end of the week off placebo week, I was experiencing hot flashes until a day or so of being back on. This happened for two months.  Like a dummy I listened to the suggestion and tried to get geared up and do this menopause thing like every women does. Its natural process, this is what women go through. I was mentally ready. So I stopped my pills.  After 1 week the hot flashes started and every week it continued to get worse.  At week 7 it was no sleep, hot flashes from hell like round the clock and felt panic attacks throughout the day.  This is the truth, for me. I have talked to so many women that describe thier symptoms as its just a bother.  Mine was pure hell.  I called the doctor and they prescribed activella an hrt. I tried it for a few days but I felt even worse.  So back to the gyn for a emergency visit. He said it would be okay to go back on the lutera for now, to stabilize me and then we will look into transitioning me to a different hrt down the road again.  Thank God, less than a week I felt better with the hot flashes and started to sleep again, no more anxiety and panic attacks.  My question is he said I could take the lutera back to back without skipping and taking the placebo week off.  I am a bit worried about it, that is ok?  I don't want to have the symptoms again, and I am sleeping again, and no more panic attacks. Does anyone take them without being off for the placebo week for their menopause symtptoms? The nurse at the doctors office said it would be ok to do either way.  This weekend would be when I go off normally.  Worried. Can't go back to those symptoms, no way. But never been on back to back. And what about the day you would get your period? Do you need to let that happen?  Sorry if this sounds so long."
jayneejay,2014-09-05T21:19+00:00,Similar to Thrush Like Symptoms but its actually Cytolytic Vaginosis (CV),"Thought I would share info..  i am one year full menopause... age 50 ... received my pap smear results and although had some thrush type symptoms in the past and treated with canestan once...  my results revealed I have Cytolyic Vaginosis, and thrush and require vaginal antibiotics for three nights then three nights of a different thrush treatment ( not Canestan)  Useful Info..  Awareness.... Women's Health Update: Cytolytic Vaginosis; A Vaginitis You May Not Have Heard About Cytolytic vaginosis(CV) is the current term for a condition of lactobacilli overgrowth. It is a little recognized but common cause of cyclic vulvovaginal complaints in women of reproductive age. CV is often misdiagnosed as candidiasis and most women have tried many antifungal medications both conventional and alternative, with little or no relief. CV was first described as a clinical entity by Cibley and Cibley in 1982 and it was initially referred to as Doderlein's cytolysis (DC). They observed that the symptoms of CV were similar to Candida vaginitis, but when viewed under a microscope, there were differences.( 1, 2) The name of Doderlein's was abandoned because these same authors realized that DC only refers to the Doderlein's species of lactobacilli when in fact there are approximately 80 different species of lactobacilli that have been described. CV was then proposed as the more accurate term that described the actual destruction of the epithelial cells caused by the overgrowth of lactobacilli. The experience of Cibley and Cibley was that the majority of the patients referred to them that thought they had chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis actually had CV instead.( 1) The normal ecosystem of the vagina involves many different organisms that are involved in a system of checks and balances. No other concept in vaginal health is as important as the state of the ecosystem of the vagina. The flora that colonizes the vagina takes place in the birth canal during delivery, and the flora that is established in the newborn girl must therefore consist of the same strains as in the mother. The vaginal environment of a newborn changes during the first month, then again at prepuberty, puberty, during the reproductive years and post-menopausally. Additionally, the cyclic hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle also influence the vaginal ecosystem. It is a variable state throughout a woman's lifetime, but nothing is more key to this ecosystem than lactobacillus. The range of bacterial types isolated is immense, including Staphylococcus species, Garnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus species, Bacteriodes species, Lactobacillus species, Mobiluncus, Candida species, (most commonly Candida albicans), and more. The predominant organism isolated from the normal vagina are members of the Lactobacillus genus. One species of bacteria inhibits another and an elegant combination of pH, vaginal immunity, hormonal activity and the community of organisms that occupy the vagina interact in a manner in which bacterial overgrowth is controlled, unless the well-established mechanism of balance is thrown off by one factor or another. Factors controlling this defense system include the health of the vaginal squamous epithelium, the dominance of Lactobacilli and the subsequent low or acid pH balance and hydrogen peroxide production, hormonal activity both over our lifetime as well as our monthly cyclic changes, pregnancy, contraceptive devices, feminine hygiene products, and vaginal sexual activity including friction, lubricants, foreign objects, and semen. It has been proposed that lactobacilli and possibly other bacteria cause the symptoms of CV. Even though we lack full understanding about the exact mechanism of lactobacilli overgrowth, a clinical condition does exist with this overgrowth that manifests as chronic cyclic burning and itching. It appears that this is probably related to an overgrowth of lactobacilli that produces irritating acids.( 1) Several mechanisms are possible for how Lactobacillus in normal amounts does its remarkable job of controlling the environment. A low vaginal pH is believed to be a primary mechanism controlling the composition of the vaginal micro flora. Lactic acid is produced by the metabolism of lactobacillus and although there may be other ways in which the vagina maintains its normal acidic environment, the role of lactobacilli seems evident. Lactobacilli thrive at an acidic pH of 3.5-4.5 and these values are indeed found in the normal vagina throughout the menstrual cycle. Lactobacilli have also been shown to interfere with how pathogenic bacteria adhere and colonize the cells of the vagina.( 3) Hydrogen peroxide production is another well-recognized method of antagonism to problematic bacterial populations and there are strains of lactobacilli that produce hydrogen peroxide (H( 2)O( 2)). A lack of H( 2)O( 2) producing lactobacilli predisposes a woman to bacterial vaginosis by allowing the overgrowth of Gardnerella and other anaerobic bacteria. Lactobacilli also act directly as antibacterials( 4) and may function as an immune stimulant locally in controlling microbial levels in the vagina. But what happens when there is too much Lactobacilli? Several species of lactobacilli ferment both glycogen and glucose to lactic acid, carbon dioxide, alcohol, formic acid, acetic acid, and hydrogen peroxide. It is these acids that cause the problem. When lactobacilli overgrow, toe many acids are produced, causing vulvar irritation and itching. Symptoms Symptoms of CV usually mimic those of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The most common symptom is itching, but vulvar burning, dysuria, and entry dyspareunia are often present as well. Cyclical and recurrent symptoms typically occur during the luteal phase and worsen premenstrually, increasing in intensity and severity until the onset of menses. Once the onset of menstrual flow occurs, the blood raises the vaginal pH and there is often dramatic relief of symptoms.( 1) The physical exam is not particularly different from candida vulvovaginitis. The vulva may appear red and slightly swollen. There may be a small amount of white and slightly clumpy discharge. The vulvar tissues may be a little tender with discomfort during the speculum exam. The cervix, vagina, uterus and adnexae are normal unless there is also some other kind of co-infection. Even the pH of the vagina is normal in CV. Diagnosis Diagnosis of CV is improved if the clinician has a high degree of suspicion of the condition. The history and physical exam basically mimics candida vulvovaginitis. The key is in the microscopic exam: 1) false clue cells with agglutination of lactobacilli to epithelial cells; 2) few white blood cells; 3) cytolysis of epithelial cells with pale or bare nuclei/cytoplasm and poorly defined cell borders; 4) absence of yeast, trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, or other organisms.( 1) Repeat microscopic exams that reveal the same findings is confirmation of CV. As you know, each episode of vaginitis symptoms may be due to a different cause. Treatment The goal of therapy is aimed at reducing the overgrowth of lactobacilli and providing relief of symptoms. Use of antifungal agents, both conventional and alternative, should be discontinued because these agents may contribute to the recurring nature of the condition. Use of lactobacilli in the form of yogurt, supplements and suppositories should be stopped. It may also be wise to discontinue use of tampons because unimpeded menstrual flow acts much like an alkalinizing agent, raising the vaginal pH and inhibiting the overgrowth of lactobacilli. Baking soda sitz baths offer relief by removing irritating acid secretions from contact with the vulvar tissues and also just a local soothing effect to excoriated tissue from itching. Mix 2 to 4 tablespoons of baking soda in 1 to 2 inches of warm bath water. Sit in the sitz bath twice a day for 15 to 20 minutes. Wash the tub after each use. Baking soda douches should be reserved for women whose symptoms do not respond to the sitz baths. This is because douching removes vaginal secretions and can disrupt the desired organisms in the vagina and create further problems in maintaining an ecological balance. Consider douching with baking soda once or twice a week during symptomatic phases when the sitz baths do not provide relief. Mix 1 to 2 teaspoons of baking soda in a pint of warm water and gently douche either in the bathtub or over the toilet. Cytolytic vaginosis may coexist with candidiasis and may need to be managed by combining therapy for both. Using the local antifungal agent in the morning and the baking soda gentle douche in the evening for seven days would be an appropriate regime that may need to be repeated monthly in the premenstrual phase of the cycle. Other recommendations may prove prudent: Reduce dietary sugar. Avoid soap in the genital area. Instead, wash with plain water, use pure unscented mineral oil on cotton balls as a cleanser Wear white, all cotton underwear and launder with mild soap and hot water, rinsing thoroughly. Avoid sexual intercourse during symptoms and initial therapy. Oral sex should also be avoided during symptomatic periods because bacteria in the partner's mouth may be irritating to the vulva. Summary As women and clinicians become aware of CV, women with cyclic vulvovaginitis will receive better health care and be managed more appropriately. With improved diagnosis of this condition and accurate treatment, fewer women will experience cyclic recurrences of their vaginitis. Success is especially seen when the wrong treatments are discontinued and something as simple as using menstrual pads are used instead of tampons. Treatment approaches to treat CV must be modified as necessary and practitioners must recognize the individual needs of each patient and be willing to be creative and somewhat experimental, utilizing the basic concepts and understanding of CV that we have discussed here."

Guest,2017-12-29T20:55+00:00,How to stop worrying about health so much???,"I’ve been staying with family during the holidays.  Today, my 12-year-old nephew asked me seriously if I am depressed.  We had been on an outing this morning to eat breakfast and go ice skating, which I enjoyed.  But I feel like everything is an effort now.  I can’t enjoy anything as much as I’d like for worrying about my health.  I’m completely sick of doctors, of being overweight, of feeling down all the time.  Exercising and improving diet help, but I have a long way to go.  My BMI is in the obese range now and I worry all the time about getting back to a normal weight.  Everything scares me, even though my A1C tested as normal (not even prediabetic), I am paranoid about what I eat.  I am preoccupied by it all the time.  My gyn and her staff completely botched up reporting some lab results after having made several other mistakes (long story) and now I don’t trust them.  I feel as though it is all on me to get a grip on this health and peri anxiety while at the same time improving my health,  I am always afraid of being diagnosed with something terrible, even though I am doing a lot to make my life better and have lost 5 pounds already. I am thinking seriously about going to a doctor who can recommend whether an anti-anxiety or antidepressant drug might help me."

I had lovely nurses, no problem getting canula in and dr popped in a mild dose of sedative, off i went to sleep and woke up later. The Dr banded 4 hemerhoids i did ask that he only do one he said truly the discomfort of one will be the same as four, today i just feel full and bit of pressure like i need to visit toilet. No polyps found, but i do have reflux mmm another menopause symptom? Or caused by anxiety? Im so relieved today, so if anyone needs this test done dont be afraid of it. It could save your life as its a screening test. all the best girls, MERRY CHRISTMAS to everyone!🍾"
Guest,2018-01-01T18:00+00:00,"Thanks again for support, making follow-up appointment","I just want to say thank you again for all the support here.  I am still overwhelmed by the kindness of so many of you who replied over the weekend in my post about worrying about health. There is just no question that I’ve lost confidence in my gyn doctor.  I feel sad about that but also know now that she is not a good listener and didn’t record details I provided prior to having her do bloodwork in August.  But since I also have Crohn’s and my GI doctor wanted me to try the Vitamin D supplements, I’m going to call tomorrow and make a follow-up appointment with him to talk about the Vitamin D and B12 results and also about my anxiety and related nutrition issues with Crohn’s.  I have seen him for several years and simply have a higher degree of trust there. I am glad that we can help each other here.  Before posting over the weekend, I was afraid it could be months before I could convince myself to go back and let someone help me. You all reminded me that I deserve good care and that means so much.  It is making me cry to write this but worth it to know I can move forward. I hope everyone here has a great new year and don’t ever forget that you deserve to be and feel well."

Fear,bad shoulder pain. Don't know what's happening to me all of a sudden. i am also having some brown colour period discharge, since yesterday. I missed my period which was suppose to be around 20 December, had  just a slight brown discharge during that time and after one day it stopped. Is it normal as I'm in peri for over 3yrs now.  I also have fibroids so not sure if this is also causing this discharge with the menopause.  Any advise will be so much appreciated as I'm so worried.  Kadija"

I can't understand how people don't understand how bad you feel (ie mum and husband )I am sure my mum thinks I'm always moaning about something. I really don't want to feel ill. My symptoms are so varied like loads of ladies. A few of them are: Fatigue. I just went out to wash the car and half way I was out of breath and sweating. Ears buzzing and jaw buzzing. Not sleeping Anxiety (terrible ) Feeling frightened inside. Terrible acid reflux - burns in my nose too. I'm assuming this is reflux related. Restless legs at night. Doom and gloom(this is awful I was always a happy person I'm not interested in going anywhere. Not interested in how I look and I always looked after myself. I like my clothes and makeup. Weak legs Freezing feet. Don't feel like washing my hair. I an trying to get on with things and ignore the feelings but I just can't. Keep plodding on I suppose.

Guest,2017-12-27T15:59+00:00,This isn't Hell on Earth. Has anyone had any luck with the Oral Contraceptive pill?,"My partner is suffering, literally DAILY. There is always another symptom.  She never knows how she's going to feel from one day to the next. She feels sick, has parasthesia, tinnitus, bad tummy, constant jumping in her left ovary, horrendously itchy skin, feelings of extreme cold then hot, and a constant flu like feeling. I have been researching this nightmare condition for over 2 years now and have managed to get a combination of vitamins for her that has at least stopped her hair falling out. But vitamins alone aren't going to cut it - she needs something else. I can't watch her like this anymore - it's heartbreaking. She is fundamentally an outgoing, hilarious and sociable person who couldn't give a s£&@ what people thought of her. She has never struggled with anxiety and yet now, thanks to this grim PM, gets terribly anxious about next to nothing. Her mood swings really are something to behold - I never know if she's going to laugh, weep or scream.  I am furious that perimenopause isn't talked about more?! It literally ruins lives. None of this,  ""oooohhh you may feel a bit hot and do a little sweat"". She'd LOVE for that to be her only symptom.  As women we are told ""you're a bit hormonal love"", or, ""you're just going through the change"". We went to the doctor and she literally wrote the website address down for a menopause website. And she is female and in her late 40s?!? What friggin hope is there, seriously.  Anyway, rant over! I'd like some advice please on whether anyone has had any luck with the oral contraceptive. My partner has regular periods and ovulation.  She is 47 and has been going through this horror for about 4 years. HRT is not something we want to consider yet, and anyway, know that any GP would tell us to get stuffed when we tell them she has regular periods. I am researching like a bad boy about the combined pill, to see if will help even things out for her. But I would love to hear from anyone with any stories, good bad and ugly, regarding the pill.  I hope this language doesn't stop my post being published, but Perimenopause - please just F.R.O ."

I went to see a consultant and had a hysterectopy last May with a biopsy she told me that my lining was very thick and bumpy. My results came back as normal and the lining was caused by noreisterone. My periods have been irregular since and my blood tests suggest I am in perimenopause. My period at the minute I spotted for 2 weeks then it has come down a bit then heavy for a couple of days then got back to light, is this normal? I no longer feel like a woman 3 stone overweight, I have another man who wants to give me the world and very interested in me but I don't feel I can give up almost 20 years of marriage and split up the the family home but my head, hormones are all over the place.

For the past 3+ weeks I've either been spotting or bleeding with maybe the odd day in between with nothing. She's also sending me for an ultrasound to hopefully eliminate anything sinister. Until the age of 50 I was on the contraceptive pill and had been for the best part of 30 years.  The past 16 days I've actually been bleeding constantly, losing clots daily and actually resorting to incontinence underwear to contain the flow. I'm actually feeling very anxious and jittery as well, the GP thinks this could be low iron levels and I'm awaiting a blood test to confirm this.  Ive just found this forum and I'm actually relieved that I'm not the only one going through this. My GP actually made me feel that what I'm going through isn't normal and has made my anxiety go through the roof. To read that other ladies are actually spotting for most of the month with heavy bleeding accompanying it is a relief. This is the first month this has happened to me. I have been having irregular periods with only 3 weeks beteeen them but they would only last 4/5 days with only 2 heavy clotting painful days... I'm really hoping this last month is due to hormone levels going crazy and can't wait for the ultrasound to hopefully put my mind at rest."

I'm 5ft 10in and weigh 14 stone (wear UK size 14/16). I know I've put weight on in the last year (mainly before I went on HRT when my peri symptoms started in ernest) but that has been exacerbated by a flare up of an underlying medical condition that prevents me exercising. I'm now able to exercise gently again in small doses so am hoping that will help, and my diet is seriously restricted by IBS so I definitely don't overeat, but the doc made me feel SO bad about myself. And he then offered me antidepressants ... which have a side effect of weight gain!!!! Any ideas how to deal with this?"

It was kind of a relief because for the past 4 years I thought I was going mad. My doctor at the time took me off the combined pill when i turned 40 and put me on the mini pill, about 6 months later i started suffering with really bad anxiety, then panic attacks then fatigue. Over the past 4 years more and more things started to change until earlier this year my fatigue got so bad i felt like i had ran into a wall. I kept going to the doctors but they just kept saying all my symptoms were down to anxiety. I changed doctors and when i explained my symptoms to my new doctor he told me i was in perimenopause. I tested the theory by coming off the mini pill and 6 weeks later the hot flushes started aling with this strange inner tremble. I am 44 and every day is a struggle. I am not the person i used to be. I have no energy and no desire to do anything. I have gone from sleeping 8hrs a night to 5. I was surprised however that GP's don't seem to know much about menopause. I asked about HRT and although they are happy to prescribe them they don't know much about them. So ladies is there anyone out there who is currently taking HRT who can tell me if they stop the symptons of menopause including fatigue & anxiety ? How do you know what levels/strength of HRT you need? What happens when you at some point in the future come off them, do your symptoms come back? And if all these symptoms are down to a fall in hormone levels why do some ladies choose to take anti depressants rather than hormone repkacement? Lorraine x"

Over the last few months (3 maybe?) my left breast has been growing larger and larger. At this point, it’s so noticeable because my shirts always fit off center now. I don’t wear tight shirts anyway but this has caused me to start buying bigger shirts so it’s not as obvious. There aren’t any lumps to speak of. And no pain at all. Does anyone have any ideas why this might be happening?  I breastfed all 8 of my children and because my left nipple is inverted, I always let that one dry out and only nursed on my right side. I only used both when I had twins. I don’t know if this has anything to do with it or not?  I’m scheduled for my annual exam in January and I plan to bring it up with him. I actually expect he’ll say something first because it has become so much bigger now.  Does anybody have any ideas??"
patty818,2017-03-06T20:46+00:00,Increasing dizziness before hot flash or do you feel like something is in your chest to.,"Hi I'm curious about someting.  I have been in menopaus for 5 yrs now.  I am hypothyroid and I have a disorder call migraine associated vertigo (MAV) this is caused by silent migraines and migraines.  It causes many sensations of dizziness, such as rocking, swaying, leaning, bobbing, swining, these sensations are felt in my head and though out my body, I also have neck and upper shoulder pain on both sides of my body which is where I think my migraines are, I have nausea, anxiety, panic that all come as part of the MAV, but I also have health anxiety and have for many years.  When going thru peri I was a wreck with panic attacks daily as mony as 5 a day.  Now its all back with this disorder,  But I have noticed an increase in dizziness right before a hot flash,then the hot flash comes and i get sweaty and I'm having drenching night sweats.  I wonder if any of you have dizziness before the hot flash, like it telling you the flash is coming but sometimes I don't think of that until the flash comes.  I have dizziness 98% of the time every day in some form, wether it be swaying, leaning, bobbing.  I also feel the floor move when I walk, it goes up and down like walking on marsh mellows.  This disorder is very scary to me, the dizziness scares me to death at times.   Other times before a flash lately I'm feeling this discomfort in my chest, like its got soemthing in it, then a min later the flash.  I'm going to see my doc wednesday about it.  I'm always worried about my heart, always have been.  I've testing before and its alway anxiety, but i ust want to make sure.  I know it sounds stupid to people, but this is how it is for me.  I'm scared alot."

jo96903,2017-12-20T09:05+00:00,"anxiety seems worse on HRT, should I persevere?","Hi, I'm new to the forum & it's been so nice to realize I'm not alone. I'm 45, 46 in a couple of months & in perimenapause.  I still have my periods although the last two have been light & only lasted a couple of days. I've been hot in my bed for a while with the covers always getting kicked off, and forgetful but the anxiety kicked in over the summer. I hadn't realised it all could be hormonal until I did some research & my sister has been feeling rubbish for the past year or so & she is a couple of years older. She was skipping periods & having panic attacks but had a rubbish experience with GP who dismissed peri completely & put her on antidepressants but did eventually refer her to menapause clinic who said she was in peri & have been really good.  5 years ago just before I turned 40 & there was a lot of stress in my life I started having panic attacks & anxietyrather than visit GP I took St John's wort & self help book & eventually after about 6 months it settled. I have always had a little bit of social or if I'm really stressed anxiety but it's always been manageable. When anxiety kicked in again this time I thought was maybe just life again so started on St John's wort which worked well but after a couple of months felt they had stopped working. Decided to speak to GP & she was really nice & said I could go down route of AD's or low dose HRT. Decided to opt for HRT as I don't feel depressed. Started just over 2 weeks ago on Evorel sequi half a patch as I am very petite & she thought it would be too much otherwise. Felt ok first few days but when I changed patch Mond last week by Tuesday was crying off & on all day & felt anxious. I was Ok ish rest of the week & weekend after changing patch on Frid but again this week I started to feel awful Monday evening & lastnight was even worse anxiety was so bad. I decided to cut the half patch in half as I'm now wondering if my estrogen levels are ok. Sorry for long rambling post! I'm due to put on everil conti patch on Frid but not sure what to expect. Is it normal to feel so bad when you go on HRT? Is it just my body adjusting? I really wanted to give it a chance as was trying to avoid AD's. Thank you for anyone's advice. Jo"
amy341731,2017-12-14T05:13+00:00,Perimenopause just one big pain!!?,"Hi all- so I’ve been following this board for about a year now  and I’m so thankful I found. It’s been a great resource and a calming factor for me in the mist of all this craziness. But honestly it’s just awful..the anxiety, emotions, physical symptoms...do any of you ladies just feel it’s like one big rotation of aches and pains? For example,  for maybe a week my back and shoulder will have sharp twinges, then my stomach has pain, then my neck and head, then my joints, then monthly cramps...it just seems never ending!! None of it is particularly  debilitating, however the anxiety gets so bad sometimes that I can barely function.  It worries me to the point where I’ve made a couple of doctors appointments, but then honestly cancel them the day before because I feel “okay”...That would just be a waste of time to go there and say, “oh yes my shoulder aches today, oh my stomach hurts, oh my neck really hurts, having some bathroom issues, why am I so sad?”...I’m 46, still get my monthly, but definitely in perimenopause..am I “okay” or should i try to get some answers..Last year when all this craziness started, I did go to my primary doctor and he just put me on Lexapro and it was absolutely horrible. I felt so ill I couldn’t get off the couch for the three weeks that I was on it, so I discontinue that and tried working and staying hydrated and trying to get out a little bit more often. It helps a bit but sometimes my brain takes over and i think I’m dying. Any advice, encouragement or venting about your woes is welcome. Take care all! 😊"

Periods are still regular in terms of timing and duration, but flow fluctuates between torrential flooding and spotting.  It's true that I have a history of depression, anyway, but it's been managed by antidepressants.  This new thing.....it's different.  It is so pronounced, I sometimes wonder if I'm losing my mind.  Seriously. Like, am I one step away from becoming the crazy lady who chases garden gnomes in her thin little housecoat because she can't remember to put on pants? Hot flashes are insane, I'm lucky if I get 4 hours of sleep a night.  I've had blood work done and my hormones appear to be within normal range.  All other values, like CBC, chemistry, TSH, all the other potential culprits are normal.  I've always had problems with heavy, painful periods and my family is literally begging me to have a hysterectomy.  My mom swears if I have a total hysterectomy (to avoid the flooding and pain) and go on hormone patches, I will feel like a new woman.  My OB-Gyn said she would do an hysterectomy on me because 1) periods ARE fierce and I get anemic, and 2) history of ovarian cancer in my family.  Anyhoo, I'm afraid it won't help and then I'll be really nutty.  Does this sound like anyone else's life and if so, what are you doing about it?  Thanks in advance!"

I have some of them, and I hoped that some of them I would avoid. It seems to me now, that it is not my case. Just for summary, I am 55, still with periods (last month only spotting, and some last month the periods were ""strange"", pinkish, or like prolonged spotting, three periods with strange anxiety and depression). Last two years I had mainly physical symptoms - heavy bleeding with flooding, pains, bloating, night sweating, fatique, etd. Last year those symptoms seemed to lift off, and I felt healthy, strong, energetic. However, since this spring, new symptoms appeared. I feel horrible. Mornings are horrible, depressive, I am full of anxiety a fears. My health anxiety is over the roof. I started with night sweats again. Cannot stand hot weather, rooms, clothes, etc. during the day. Hands shaking, several panick attacks, feeling like fainting soon. Strange hot feeling over my face and arms (hands sweating) with panick several time during the day (are those hot flashes? Had not yet), whoosh whoosh feeling in my head, arms when falling asleep, ""hearing"" my blood in my veins (strange, is it?) I want to cry, yell, run away, hide somewhere, afraid of going mad. Is this how my life will be? Actually, I am afraid of future... I am going to be ill, sick, etc.all the time? What to say more... I exercise regularly, love walking, try racewalking.

I've had no 'natural' periods since about August 2015. Any I've had have been brought on through medications given by the go, the pill ect. I noticed a low mood about this time and went on Sertraline and the pill. Unfortunately I just didn't feel myself, emotionally numb and zero sex drive. I decided to stop the sertraline and have been off them now for about 2 month's, I also stopped the pill about 4 months ago. My mood is not low, I have loads to be excited about, and lots going on, I'm studying with the open university full time, hoping to graduate in 2019, I'm volunteering at my local food bank, and attempting to move into professional photography part time soon. I also am married and mum of 4. My problem is, I just feel anxious about the silliest things and can't concentrate on anything else! If I am doing it planning something new, it will consume my thoughts for days before, stressing about it, and more often than not, I'll have worked myself up so much, that I will cancel or just not turn up!

Hi ladies I am back here have been ausent of the forum trying to put my emotions in order and find the right mix for me. Let me tell you very hard to find a right doctor and don't even start taking about right prescriptions, it is so horrible hard my main problem is anxiety after trying different docs who try to pump me with antidepressants I found this woman doctor who really tried to fit in my shoes and I have excellent references about her. The point is now I am trying to go natural after using HRT the Premarin didn't work because I got my period ( very weird by the way) and the obgyn suspended the Premarin and just kept the estrogen 100 which supposedly helped me with the other issues ( the only issue that I have is anxiety). Also I went from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroid which she think triggered the anxiety levels. Now I am taking synthroid 50 in the morning after B stress complex before going to work when I can work I am in so much fear of loosing my job which I love, during the day i try to manage the anxiety with Bach flowers pastille but I need something also. At night I take metoprolol that help with the thyroid and palpitations and later now that I am not taking the progesterone I am using for a second day melatonin but honestly I haven't sleep good in a long time.

dee28383,2017-12-16T14:41+00:00,Update on tests and HRT,"Hello again everyone! I finally had all my test done..whew! No news from my MRI..so, since it's been over a week, I am safe to say nothing bad showed up. Thank goodness! Saw my new menopause doctor. She was great! She prescribed me a low dose estrogen patch, 100mg progesterone, and a low dose antidepressant. We will see how things go from here,but, I am feeling optimistic! She said that women who go through early menopause ( I was 45 ), definitely lack estrogen. The progesterone is to balance everything out further. The antidepressant s for my big mood swings and sadness I have from the whole year and a half of hell I went through. She is also linking the more severe pms/menopause symptoms with women who have had traumatic childhoods. Which I definitely had!!! So, she recommended a therapist for me to see to help me deal with all that from this stage of my life. She recommended a book for me to read called. ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by author Bessel Van Der Kolk. I picked it up last night. I had blood work done yesterday to check all hormones and some mineral levels. Will have results next week. I am also going to have a bone density test done. My regular doctor never once helped me with any of this..I started getting very irregular periods when I was 39..she would just say..why is that happening? I didn't know..so she sent me in my way. Looking back, I should have been more concerned. Please be assertive for your health!! Our voices must be heard. So, that's it so far. Will keep you guys updated over the next while as to how things progress...have a great weekend! Xo"

The breasts, vagina, clitoris don't seem to have much sensitivity . Orgasms are rare and gone in the blink of an eye. This is sooo horrible. Doctors are so ambivalent about it. They just expect one to accept it. My gynac after much persuasion ( and pretending I have horrible hot flashes and insomnia) put me on Premarin which is a conjugated estrogen. I also use estriol cream and an otc progesterone called naturogest. I recently bought a testosterone supplement from my fitness store but the guy said it's for men and may not work for women. Really, this is so frustrating. Everyday I think of ending my relationship. This is so unfair. I think my partner deserves better. In fact, I think we women deserve better. Why the heck is there no female Viagra?? Are there only otc testosterone creams available? Because my doc refuses to prescribe any."

dizwap,2017-12-13T15:55+00:00,Perimenopause anxiety and heart symptoms with insomnia,Hi everyone. I’m 48 years old and for the past couple of years I feel like my life has been turned upside down. I used to be a very good sleeper but have turned into a raging insomniac. If I fall asleep I wake up 2 to 3 hours later then I’m awake again for 2 hours then if I manage to get back to sleep it’s only for an hour or so and I wake with my heart racing and feeling like I can’t breathe and full of butterflies and dread for absolutely no reason whatsoever. My heart races all day and thuds with skipped beats. I’ve had ECGs and 24 hour ECG and various test and all is ok so I know it’s my age. I’m puffing and panting and totally exhausted. But the physical anxiety symptoms are overwhelming. Shaking and irritable and totally not myself at all. My periods used to be every 4 weeks but now are every 3 so that “week before” comes around far too quickly all the time. I also have hot sweats and burn ups both day and night. I just want it all to stop. I have clonazepam for when I feel like I’m going to go insane (I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome so need that as a muscle relaxant and to help me deal with pain) ...  I’m about to start Lyrica to see if helps with any of the symptoms and to calm me down. It would be good to connect with other ladies who are experiencing similar.

My last period was Nov. 17th  Today would be day 26. My symptoms around the 12-15 days were BAD. After that until now they weren’t horrible- still there but not overwealming. Today- I seem to be having more.  Whoosh whoosh head last night. Heart palps. Random pains here and there. This morning- more heart palps, heavy head, more health anxiety and fear of “is that a heart attack? My left elbow hurts” and “oh wait- is THAT a heart attack? My jaw hurts”....”maybe THATS a heat attack, I might feel chest pain”......so yeah it’s one of those mornings here lol. Evidently starting on day 25 or so, progesterone gets higher and estrogen plummets?  How about you? Have you noted any specifics during certain days?"

She's been to several docs but they can't find anything that's wrong with her. She will wake up in the middle of the night with head pressure, confusion.... just nasty feelings in the head that you can't really describe. She has had heart palpitations. But since 2 nights ago her heart beat was beating out of rhythm. She felt like she was going to have a heart attack. Today her chest area is sore. Anyone going through meno has same?

The discharge I experienced was hardly anything, and nothing since then. And I have not gone 12 months without a period. I’ve had 4 this year and my last one was 7/24/2017. FSH was 53.2, which was in post menopause range...but still haven’t gone a year without a period. I’m so confused with menopause. After transvaginal US (no significant finding, possible Adenmyosis, which is common in women 40-50 and having children and my lining was 4.1mm) my Dr ordered a endometrial biopsy to make sure no pathological process is going on. I thought 4.1mm would not be suspicious of anything."

What I’m really worried about though is pain during sex then continual browny bloody discharge and lumpy bits afterwards (for weeks sometimes). (Apologies for the grim description!!)  Pain during sex is NOT due to dryness but it’s so painful it makes me cry, which is kind of a passion killer. My doc has had a good look around and Ive had smear tests to rule out cervical cancers (test was clear) but why am I still getting this? Is this due to lack of Estrogen?  I take no hrt or anything so maybe I should consider this? I’m so worried about it and keep thinking something awful is wrong.

To find the exact area, imagine if you were reaching to feel a swollen gland or something.....and then move a little to the right (on the right side, the right gland) I know this sounds absurd 😂😂 It’ll come and go every now and then today.  I’m plagued with minor headaches today too, and LOTS of gassy issues. No stomach aches, just the gurgling and stuff.  The sharp random pains in different areas from Peri freak me out the way they show up for like a whole day and then disappear for weeks.  It’s so maddening."

donna23840,2017-12-02T00:45+00:00,Out of the Darkness..,"Hi Ladies, I am a new member of this forum. I have been following for awhile now and have even wept over many of the discussions that I have read. My story is basically the same symptom wise as many other women. In my case I didn’t get the opportunity to ask my Mother or Grandmother about the mysteries of menopause since there are obviously many of them. I lost my Mother 2 weeks after the birth of my son (13years ago) .. She was killed by a hit and run while crossing the street on the way to celebrate the birth of her new Grandson. My Grandmother passed a few months later from a heart attack. So I was postpartum & grieving with an onset of pre-menopause..( I was 33 at the time ) As to not bore you with the wretched details of the downward spiral of my life..I will fast forward..  I RAN to the doctor for HELP & pretended to hold it all together for about 5 years after that.. Until the reality hit me that the medications were Exact in only one thing; the “Side Effects”!! (At least for the medication I was on anyway)  I was a MESS!  I was nervous continuously, dizzy, fatigued, hair falling out, weight gain.. It was terrible! I was at the end of myself.. Screaming in Silence!!  So.. on August 30, 2009 I took ALL of my medication at once wanting to be set free! So I thought! 3 days later I woke up with Family & Friends surrounding me. I felt ashamed & Mad it didn’t work.. Still selfishly thinking me, me, me!! I soon began to realize that my “Life” was saved for a reason!! Since that time I have spoken of the debilitating effects of Depression, Menopause & “I” decided to help myself & so can you!! Today I’m on NO medications, my hair is long & thick, I have managed my weight, and I LOVE LIFE!! More Importantly I have my Husband & our Son! I Thank GOD everyday for saving my life.. My Sisters if you’re sad reach out to someone close to you in person or on a forum such as this one; where there’s nothing but support! Don’t “Suffer in Silence” like I did. I know it was a cowardly thing to do & believe me Many people reminded & still remind me!! But.. I’m Blessed to still be Alive & given a “Second Chance” ..  I am “Out of the Darkness” Stay Happy ????😊  All the best xx Donna"

SamN22,2017-01-30T01:11+00:00,Perimenopause Hell,"Dear Everyone. I feel like I am going through hell. I am not exaggerating. I am feeling lost and that I have lost myself. I recently found out that I had mostly likely started in period menopause in my late 20's early 30's and although I had been tested at the time due to horrendously heavy periods the results got missed and then last year due to the same symptoms and seemingly having heavy periods every 2 weeks and feeling exhausted with it all I requested another test and was informed that yes I was definately peri menopausal but then I had been for many many years... I had been missed by GP at the time. I will be 42 this week. I was firstly put on fem seven patches as concerns held that as I had gone into very very early peri menopause with low oestrogen all those years back what the impact could be on my bones. The first patches were ok but the second patches plunged me into hell. I am now (this last week) on a combined hrt treatment of levorel 75 patches ongoing which I have to change twice a week combined with progesterone tablets which I have to take twice a day for 12 days out of every month alongside. Now on to me: my memory is gone, I'm accident prone, I hurt from head to toe, the pain in my joints particularly neck, shoulders, elbows and hips etc is constant and has been for years. Holding a hairdryer above my head for more than a minute hurts. I cry at everything. I mean at everything. Adverts, music, anything can set me off. My poor fella is constantly passing me tissues. I feel maternal towards everything. I'm even talking to the spiders in the house. I feel like mother earth but that means I'm feeling every living creatures pain which means I'm always in tears. I have the dreaded sweats and insomnia. My confidence is rock bottom and I feel so old and fat. I don't recognise myself I feel like I'm not existing and I can't remember who I am or who I used to be. I feel like I've lost my identity. I do work full time and i work long hours and manage this (just) but out of work I'm an empty shell. I know it's hormone related and it's the dreaded symptoms of this phase of life. I have no energy either. Do any of you ladies feel like this? And have you found any solutions to make you feel better? Thankyou for reading ?"

Great all the way up to about 2:30 pm and yup....here it comes again. Started with a headache, then the vice grip instead of actual “pain”, and just that feeling of “off”. Sometimes it feels like something fuzzy is crawling on your scalp. How nice right?  So I finally laid down and dozed for a little bit. Got up thinking for a few minutes I felt better.  No such luck.  I gave it 15 min after getting up and then Peri said “oh hey, just to make sure you know I’m still here I’m gonna make your neck hurt and then I’m gonna make your ears feel like they’re being forcefully clogged up.

peter25058,2017-11-08T17:04+00:00,Menopause and Psychotic behavior,"Hi All;    My wife has been admitted to all of the surrounding psych wards over the last 10 years,  starting with the first signs of menopause.  I wish to get in contact with anyone in similar circumstances, because I have been unsuccessful in convincing any of at least a dozen psychiatrists that there is any relation to menopause.     We have found a medication that stabilizes her, but besides the horrendous expense, I believe it is like fixing a watch with a sledge-hammer.   If you are interested, I think it may be helpful to pool our experiences, and even look for others 'in the same boat'.   My hope is that because my wife's condition was coincident with menopause, there may a more specific treatment.  Also, I understand menopausal conditions are not permanent, and yet, so far, all medical diagnosis suggest her condition is permanent.    I am frustrated at the inflexible position of the medical profession;  that my wife's condition is permanent, when the solution to her symptoms at the moment was discovered almost randomly,by the trial  of possibly 10 other drugs first.

I am 5 years post Menopause and I had all the typical symptoms in peri...sweats, insomnia, weigh gain, heavy bleeding etc.  Probably about 3 1/2 years I started to get this very vascular head, pulsating, tingling in my face, tongue, hands & feet & now front of my calves.  When it first comes on I can feel really odd like whoozy, empty headed & vision can seem strained.  It appears that I get this daily.  I try to plow through the whoozy, empty head/vision thing but the tingling extremities that feel like ants are crawling on you or that your face feels like you are coming off novacane is driving me nuts.  I am wondering if anyone else has experienced this.  I have been diagnosed with Rosacea, so maybe that’s the vascular facial part...I don’t know.  Also, once this happens it seems to last for the better part of the day.  I know it lists tingling extremities on menopause symptoms, but I rarely hear woman complain about it...am I the only one?"

One system that really bothersome the most is the feeling of I can't breathe. and this brings on more of the anxiety. These feeling just came out of no where about two years ago. Ihave been to the doctors several times, the heart doctor, the E.R and I have checked out fine. The doctor put me on anti-anxiety meds which I do not like to take, due to more side affects. I used to love to go camping with friends, go out place overnight with my husband now I'm afraid to do all the things I used to enjoy in fear of passing out, on the anxiety and panic to hit and feel of being embarrassed. I guess I'm not alone and this is a feeling of many of you. Now I found a place I can come a get some comfort."

In the beginning of peri I would get this build up of pressure and gas right below my left breast where my bra cup stops. It would sometimes move to my back at the same level.  It is so uncomfortable. Sometimes I have to remove my bra and walk around my house without a bra to get relief. Does anyone else have this trapped gas under the breast and what can I do to relieve it?

I called the doctor last week after 3 days and the receptionist very abruptly told me yeah, yeah, normal, could take a week. Well will have been a week tomorrow and it's still going strong.  I don't have a fever or significant cramps but I do have the belly discomfort that I have had for a while now and a little bit of lower back pain & ovary twinges like I used to get when I had my period.   This feels kind of like a never ending period and it's freaking me out because, well, that's how I roll these days - constant anxiety.   Hoping someone here has had this and can reassure me it's not dire.  I see the doctor for the biopsy follow up in a week and a half. maybe a dumb question but has anyone's doctor every told them *why* this bleeding after a biopsy happens and is considered ok? thanks"

My mind keeps running in different directions because I'm so desperate to feel better...I've had one hormone test done (last fall) and it showed high FSH levels which could be an indicator of perimenopause....and my period has been very erratic....but then when I read about symptoms of anxiety, they're also very similar to how I'm feeling....am I losing my mind?

I have been literally bed bound since going through this. (8 mths) i ve done thyroid test several times and the test.changes from hyper to hypo and sometimes normal. Because of the fluctuation , the dr. said she cant give me meds and besides its not too much out of range. But, its enough to cause symptons for me. My eyes are bulging, muscle weakness, jittery, stomach jittery, bowels urgency, hands tremors, back constantly hurts, cold feet, etc. It constantly switches . I know alot of the symptons mimic peri but in my case i really believe some could be thyroid issue because of my blood results."

The spotting then stopped and everything was ‘normal’ for a few months... expect my anxiety levels that were pitching at an all time high, and still are! Anyway, this month my period has been non existent, just very, very light spotting, almost nothing, I’ve still had the tender breasts and sore back, just literally no blood.... I’m 39, is this normal? I’m almost at the stage that  I feel ever week there is something else... my bloods have been taken twice and are totally fine but I am seeing a gyno in January, more to give me some peace of mind my doctors says than anything else.

I’ve had a few consultations with my GP and it’s likely that a Gynaecologist will perform a biopsy at some stage to find the cause of the bleeding. I am spotting daily on peri menopause.  I’m 57 and just starting peri I think.  Prior to 6 months ago I had regular periods. I’ve researched this and know that a general anaesthetic is the right way for me to go.  I know you are not always offered one but I’ll pay if I have to. Has anybody had this?  How was it and how did you feel when you come round?  I’ve never been to hospital before and feel very scared.  More so I’m scared what they could find.

I take medication which does help but over the last few months it’s rocketed! About 4 months ago I started having spotting from the time I ovulate until my period started... this lasted 2 months then stopped.  My GP did a Pap test, did all my bloods and had an US done... all came back fine.  However I’m still beyond stressed. I visited him last week and he did my bloods again and as I was so stressed and said he would refer my to a gyno... and if I wanted we could get a repeat US at day 3-5 of my cycle as this will be more accurate at assessing the endometrium.  Also the gyno he wants me to see isn’t available until mid January and that’s totally freaking me out too,  however he sent me a text today saying   ‘I think your bleeding is hormonal so the review with Dr Smirnova is not needed urgently from my perspective.  If you are feeling that you are freaking out it is better that you come in to discuss this with me so I can reassure you that you are safe.’ In my more rational moments I think that I’m not even spotting any more and I have had 3 US in the last 3 years and around 4 Pap test, all were fine... however at the moment my rational moments are few and far between... but surely if there was spotting something isn’t right?? I’m trying not to have another US as I’m trying to take control of my irrational thoughts but it’s so hard.  Is anyone else feeling this way too...?"

Hips and lower back ache which has gradually got worse. Have made an appointment to see my GP as someone told me it could be the start of the menopause. Has anyone else suffered from this and what did you take to relieve it? I have been taking paracetomol when its gets too bad but sometimes it doesnt relieve the pain at all! Not sure if i should be taking a supplement or not or what i should take! I thought it might have been osteoarthritis so Ive started taking codliver oil tablets and a supplement of glucosamine, MSM + Chondroitin but not noticed any change and dont know if thats what i should be taking or not. Its all very confusing as there is so much information on the web and so many different supplements available.

dawnm1970,2017-11-26T21:20+00:00,High FSH Level,"I’m 47 and have been experiencing irregular periods for about 5 years. My Gyno ordered an FSH test that came back 53.2, she then ordered an TVUS because I had slight discharge a month prior.  After TVUS, the Dr that was in there during the exam told me everything looked good (e.g ovaries, strip was 4.2) and it looked like I had a follicle or cyst on right ovary. I asked him did this mean I might be having a period and he said I could. I’m so confused!! My FSH is in the post menopause range. My last period was 7-24-2017. I’ve had 4 periods this year. Any one with similar situation?"

I understand everyone must play around with bc till you find what’s right for you. I hate the idea of synthetic tho. Option 2. Is a pill or compound cream. Though he said cream is usually more for vaginal atrophy. I know it’s not covered by insur which is fine. My symptoms are night sweats, my core gets hot sometimes, mult areas of stiffness/joint pains. Can anyone give me what worked for them!!!  Thanks"

I was also on a horrific blood pressure RX that caused similar side effects as menopause, so the lines are blurred as to whether what I suffered last night is still fall out from the bad B/P RX (off of it for 4 months now, but was on it for 5 years) or is this a menopause issue.  So last night I experienced tingling in my hands & feet (started at the top of my feet and radiated up to the calves & also hands) I thought maybe I had a pinched nerve - I have had this in the past, but never so severe.  Thinking it was a pinched nerve, I took an Advil & went to bed.  I woke up with a pain in my heart (severe gas) then palpitations & today headachy, brain fog, very vascular feeling face & some flushing....just feel like caa caa.  Has anybody else felt this way & is this caused from plummeting progesterone?  My glucose is normal and the tingling in extremities kinda subsided during the day, but is back....just can’t figure it out. Help! I hate this!"

Gillfc,2017-11-20T10:04+00:00,Long weird period - Help!,"Hi ladies. I'm wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone else. I'm 46 and having my first weird period. I've always been pretty regular, although I was a late bloomer and didn't get my first period until I was 18.  Over the last year or so my cycles have shortened from 28-30 days to 25-26 days. They also have shortened in length from 7 days to 5-6. I had 4 shorter cycles in the last year or so, Sept last year 19 days, this past January 18 days, July 17 days and last month was 20 days. I haven't skipped a period or had any really heavy ones but day 2 may have gotten just a little bit heavier than before, nothing really to write home about. I don't suffer from bad cramps. I always considered myself fairly lucky.  Now this month! I started spotting on Nov 1st (day 21 of my cycle) Red blood, only when I wiped and a couple of drops a day, sometimes just a light spotting on a panty liner. I had an apt with my GP on Nov 7th so I planned to mention it. I spotted for 6 days then woke on Nov 7th with mild cramps ans voila, my period. Day 1 was light, as often is. I told my doctor who ordered a pap smear to be safe but said it was probably hormones and my age. I wake on day 2 to very light bleeding, it tapered off as the day wore on. I didn't need more than a normal pad, day 2 is generally a 3 or 4 'Long' pad day. Day 3 woke up, passed a rather large clot and some more flow, then again it tapered off to a 'dribble' - Same on day 4. I woke up on day 5 and virtually nothing, I was making a cup of tea in the afternoon when I coughed and passed another clot, smaller this time but after my flow was more steady for 2 days, still not heavy but steady. Since then it's been light, stop and start, some times like spotting again, some times just super light. It only seems to 'come out' when I am walking about. This is day 14 and it's still going... I woke with some mild cramps but flow is still light.  Click here to view image This Wednesday is in fact 18 months since he died. Yes, I'm stressed and worried. I already have chronic illness PTSD, and panic attacks. I started a new job a couple months ago, it's working from home which is great but it's been a big change in my lifestyle. I have a Christmas party to attend in London at the beginning of Dec, I haven't been anywhere alone in years! I have been freaking out about that and was obsessing over my period before all this too, I even googled ways to delay your period as I didn't want to be 'on' for the party.

These head issues drive me absolutely crazy. The “tremor thingys”....a few of you have talked about feeling them too. It’s almost like a buzzing or fuzzy feeling at the back of my head.  Almost- not quite but almost as if it could be “heard”, but I can’t actually “hear” it. Sometimes it feels like a faint throb- and like my heartbeat is in my head. I’m starting (I think) to notice that it precedes a headache. Seems like i get a headache like 15 min or so after it starts. Today has just really been annoying. Aches and pains in various moving spots- like my body is trying to set off dang fireworks or something. Periods all wonky and weird. Last month light as heck and only lasted 4 days, now this month heavier and almready on day 6. AND showed up a week early. ALL of these things point to some out of whack hormones, and I know that. But the health anxiety that kicks in when the symptoms start makes it worse.  Ok everyone- sorry for complaint yet again- I’ve been posting on this forum like everyday for darn near a week now. Been a tough week and communicating with ladies who either understand or better yet, HAVE the same issues, is the most helpful thing to me thus far!

She's throwing that tight chest feeling at me, and what an arm she has. She's also stuffing something in my ears to make me feel like they're gonna pop.

Then she laughs evilly and makes my eyes blur for a second before she starts all over again. I think she's mad because I took Advil and that got rid of the cramps. Pretty sure what really did her in was the vitamins and ACV and molasses because she knows how healthy that stuff is. Flo is one heck of an opponent!!

Guest,2017-11-09T16:39+00:00,My gyn's take on vitamins,"I saw my gyn this morning for a recheck on some lab work.  My GI doctor had me taking Vitamin D supplements earlier this year because I have Crohn's disease and blood work showed that my D level was low.  I was already taking other vitamins, including B12.  I went to gyn with dry mouth two months ago and her findings showed B12 was too high. In case this helps anyone, my dry mouth went away completely after I stopped taking all vitamin supplements.  My gyn ordered blood work this morning to recheck my Vitamin B12 and D levels and also thyroid, which was in the high end of normal.  She told me that even with the Crohn's I can get the vitamins I need by eating properly. I learned from all this that vitamin supplements may or may not be a good idea and suggest checking with a doctor before taking them.  If a doctor says it's okay to take them, be sure they're going to recheck your levels at some point.  My GI doctor put me on Vitamin D knowing that he won't see me again before my regular visit next year and did not request a recheck.  Not good!"

This was accompanied by erratic mood swings, constant fatigue, extremely heavy periods, flooding and clots. I have also recently started feeling a heaviness and tenderness in my abdomen and find it hard to walk a couple of days a month. I am 44 and have been on tranxenamenic acid for years which helps and started anti depressants in January as I was finding it very difficult to cope and felt like I was going mad. I went to the doctor as I suspected perimenopause and he initially agreed. I went for a scan and found out I have multiple fibroids. Doctors are suggesting a hysterectomy and said the night sweats etc might go when fibroids are removed. How do I know if my symptoms are caused by fibroids or if I am premenopausal?"

I thought I'd be done bleeding at my age, but it's like my body doubled down and has been pitching a hissy fit. So I started on natural progesterone cream about 10 days ago, and I'm taking 3 weeks to ramp up to the required dose. I feel good... except... I worry that I'm weird. Weird because.....Yesterday my body started throwing out these huge, and I mean massive clots like I've never seen before, and weirdly, it feels like a physical relief. Is that weird??  I expected to feel worse for a while before feeling better, as the estrogen receptors up-regulate due to the progesterone, so the bleeding doesn't worry me right now. I don't have any cramping or serious PMS-- I actually feel a lot better than I have in a long time. Meanwhile, over the last year or so, it felt like my uterus had become spongy and swollen, and ""gummed up"" so to speak, and the only thought I have when passing these big clots is ""oh thank God. Whew. Relief.""  Is that weird? Any similar experiences?"

It hurt, was upset , heartburn, it felt like it was moving around , at times like I was going to have my period but didn't . that  lasted about 10 days . Never had it agsin until now . It's  a sick feeling in stomach but lower addominal area too. Kinda like I've ate something that has kinda bothered me. And at times a feeling as if I might have my period . It was about 2 days then it stopped was fine then started again yesterday . I will say I have had lots sinus drainage too, which can make my stomach upset. Anyone one else have this ? What can I do for it ?"
AJacynM,2017-11-20T10:52+00:00,Horrid Hormones!,"Hi,  I am 45 and have been going through the menopause for a year now, but peri menopausal for around 3 year before this...  Recently my symptoms got so bad I am now using HRT (I ache EVERYWHERE,  am exhausted all the time, can't think straight, feel anxious and dreadful). I started HRT as I desperately want to try and get my life back... I've always been active, happy and alert but not anymore and it's so upsetting as now I literally find it hard to get out of bed each morning and function.  I have two children and I am not the mother I used to be which makes me just cry.  I've been using patches for nearly 3 weeks and still feel really bad... the aching in my legs is just awful. Does anyone out there use patches and does it take longer to gain relief from them or are they just not for me?  Thank you for taking the time to read this and any help would be so gratefully received...  AJ."
Mayfly1,2017-11-17T19:45+00:00,Misophonia,"Hello all, I think I am developing this, and I wondered if anyone else experienced it?  For about 3 years now, I have been sensitive to noise and noticed if people called my name, I'd jump.  I hate sirens, things clattering and just odd noises on occasion but its the TV through the floor that really triggers me.  Could this be yet another symptom of the menopause?  Someone has suggested that it's also connected with having nothing in one's life (I work and that's it, pretty much) and therefore a fixation occurs on a noise.  So it could be that as well.  I know I'm not coping brilliantly with the menopause and it may be that the sudden onset of anxiety is causing this problem or it could be the other way around,"

I don’t get any other symptoms like saw boobs, stomac ach, when your due to start a period, just 3/4 days of that feeling of low mood again, is that normal to feel like it’s PMS with out the symptoms ???  I’m on a strong dose of antidepressants at the moment that does work wonders, and I feel loads better then I use to do, just prob once a month my mood drops for a few days, then back to normal, just wondering if it possible that y your going through the menopause without the periods, you would still get low days as tho your just going start???

evelyne00,2017-11-09T09:11+00:00,"So scared again, can't really believe this is just perimeno... . :-(","Hi ladies, Here I am again. I'm starting to feel like a stalker and an hysterical hypochondriac but I'm so scared again. :-( This forum has been a relief but anxiety strikes again now that my doctor's appointement is coming closer and since I've had a pretty bad day yesterday. Summary of what makes me feel this way: I'm now on the 12th day of 'colored discharge on the toiletpaper' which started 3 days after my last period and 1 day after I had intercourse (don't know if that has something to do with it but trying to give all the info). On the 8th day of that colored discharge, I suddenly had a very bloating feeling and something that felt like a blatter infection: urge to urinate but without the pain. That same night, I suddenly had a bright red bleeding. It filled about half a tampon (sorry again for the too much info) and after that is was gone and the colored discharge on the toiletpaper returned.  Yesterday, on the 11th day, the discharge was gone but I suddenly had cramps who felt like the ones I have when my period starts. And yes, the colored discharge was back, looking more light brownish than pinkish (older blood?). I've had cramps all night but nothing despite the colored discharge came through. I also had a feeling like something was pushing on my blatter, but maybe those were just the cramps. It was also the second time the discharge becomes more bloody after taking a shower.  I've read here that some women had a period shortly after another. But mine isn't a period, it's always 'colored discharge on the toiletpaper' and 1 bright red short bleeding. And then I see the symptoms of the terrible c-word: urge to urinate, spotting between periods, pain that goes to your leg (had that yesterday with the cramps) and then I'm freaking out... . The only thing what gives me hope, along with what I've read here, is the fact that my last period was slightly different from the others: less heavy.  So yes, I know you're not doctors, but with all this new info added, does someone reconises it? Can this still be perimeno? So sorry again but I promise: if this is just perimeno, I'll become a devoted member of this group and will try to support other women who are going through this uncertain and quite scary time."

(I type ""lol"" but I'm not actually laughing right now, not that much anyways)  Hows THIS weirdness for you....curious to know if anyone has ever experienced something like this before.  Standing in grocery store line, feeling FINE..... Suddenly out of nowhere SHOOTING pain on the top of my foot, travels at light speed up my leg and somehow ends in my back. So fast I could almost barely make out ""where"" it traveled along the way.  I thought, ok, that was weird and it hurt, but also thought about how my neck and shoulders have been SO tensed and tight. Maybe it was that? Of course, I immediately get ""freaked"" out like many of us do, expecting to literally die of some crazy disease right there on the spot.  I get out to my car, back out, and immediately feel that weird ""head thing"" that I get where my head just feels ""full"" or ""heavy"" it's the only way I can describe it, and then some dizziness.  Obviously the heart starts racing which I'm pretty sure is anxiety after that, but as usual, my BRAIN tells me the heart racing is connected to the weird shooting pain and head heaviness and I""m surely going to die on the short ride of 2 miles back to my house.  Then, the gurgling in my stomach starts....and my throat feels ""sort of"" tight.  First symptom turns into all this??   My question is.....when our hormones are raging like this, and we've done stupid unhealthy things for a few days...does it make symptoms worse during this ""week"" (and I'm in ""hell week"" as I call it. Before my period, where I get random symptoms every day, think I'm dying, then make it through it and have a few good days before it starts again)  Here's a list of all the stupid things I've done in the last two days..including today.  Yesterday- At like a ""normal"" person w/o health anxiety: Oreo's, chips n salsa, woke up at 3am and ate a ziploc bag of cheezits.  Didn't drink enough water.  Didn't go to sleep until 3am.  Didn't take my vitamins Today- Haven't drank much water Smoked too many cigarettes sitting at my computer trying to find contractors to fix my destroyed hurricane house.  Didn't EAT anything (still, because now it's in the oven from grocery store)  Didn't take my vitamins.  Under a BOATLOAD of stress last two months w/the hurricane and damage and fighting w/insurance companies.  Oh, and I'm also living at my moms w/my kids (adult kids that is) and come on...as much as we all love our parents, do we REALLY want to move back in at 46? lol Thoughts??  Thank god for this board. Idk what I'd do without even just reading through these things.  Can't go to doctor, no insurance and no money at the moment.  Symptoms as of now are ""calming"" down since I""ve been typing this. Not ""gone"", still have a bit of heavy head and annoying feeling in my throat."

I thrived on ""go go go"", now I'm like a dang softy.  But it bothers me to ALLOW this stuff to even get u see my skin because sooooo many people have it so much worse. My boys' band is on the brink of soaring, there's a record deal on the table already overseas, there's huge plans already in the making, things we've worked for for EIGHT years,  since they were 13 and 14....why in the WORLD would I be allowing a stupid insurance claim and being displaced for a bit cause me to feel this way?!?! I would never have been effected by this in my earlier years! As a matter of fact,  in 2004 we lost literally every single thing we owned in hurricane Francis and we turned it into an adventure! I feel like I should be able to handle all this with ease. Can peri REALLY cause you to have anxiety over things that are most likely going to work in your FAVOR after all the crap is sorted out?? I feel like an u grateful moron right now. Why am I not over at my house finishing my content list for the insurance company? Why am I not over there preparing and doing this huge list of stuff I have to do?!  Instead- I'm procrastinating sitting here at my moms freaking out because I feel icky and wondering if I'm gonna die today. I absolutely hate the way our minds go all wonky at this time in our lives.

It is extremely interesting to read about your experiences with peri/meno! I confess that I thought I might just scrape through without too many problems.  I talked to one lady who had absolutely no symptoms and was fine, to others who all mention hair loss, quite a few. I am nearing my 52nd birthday, and since turning 50 I have noticed that may hair has just thinned out so much and with it my confidence.  It is bad;  I just don't recognise myself anymore... Sunken eyes, dark circles, thin greying hair I look awful and somedays I just feel so weak. Lately  I felt such pain and tighness in front on neck with some swelling and I fear my thyroid may be going awol, if not gone. My skin is dry and I am cold. Can anyone relate to these symptoms? Sorry my brain is foggy today hence meadnering  post here. I do feel desperate as hair loss is just something else, when I wash it out it comes in strands and when I try and dry it is eveyrwhere, I get so weary clearing up bathroom afterwards...strange thing is I can't cry about it or get too depressed about it, just seems pointless,but I feel helpless, particulary about tightness and pain around throat area it;s a misery!

I’ve been not too bad but last week leading up to my birthday I felt pretty low and after finding out a good friend was going away for her birthday (as she does every year) I felt more depressed.... of course I hid my feelings well from my hubby who would usually say what have you got to be depressed about????? The last couple of days I kind of felt better but today I decided to go through some of my old art stuff ( my hubby had been on my case to clear it out ages ago to make some room which I agreed) I had started to dabble in art years ago when I was going through depression & PTSD, so this clearing out is a big deal for me with a lot of memories attached. I got through most of it ok but got pretty tearful when I came across paintings that I had done especially ones that I had done while visiting my Counselor while I was going through sessions. I threw out a lot of stuff and I’m a way i’m glad I did but it’s just left me emotionally drained...and my hubby, he said” oh, that’s great, are you ok, it had to be done.... sometimes he just doesn’t get how hard it is for me.....

Anxiety was killing me and I was unable to leave normally """" and work. Long story short I passes for various doctors that sent me ER with blood pressure medication to calm my blood pressure issues that came as a result of anxiety that came as a result of menopause, is what they said. They told that I was depressed, menopause, and look for psychiatric help it was just craziness product of menopause, you are just a woman, and woman didn't suppose to leave this long (seriously!!!!). I was prescribed with lorazepam like it was candy in Halloween, thanks god i didn't take it as was prescribed. First doctor super nice, I asked him several times to check my thyroid level, he said nope and basically refused to do any blood tests. Second told me in my face that I was just a neurotic menopause woman, but did the test. The tests showed that my thyroid was hyper active and after years of havin hypothyroidism I was now wifh hyperthyroidism!!!! Huge difference  I took my test and I found a doctor referred by a friend who hold my hand and told me ... you are not loosing your mind don't worry is Perimenopause that came together with your hyper active thyroid. She changed all my medications, basically synthroid 50 in the morning , vitamin b stress to control anxiety and night metoprolol 25 to stabilize my heart rate that went crazy because of my thyroid and also help to regulate blood pressure that was like rollercoster, with no history of BP for the last 30 years, and Progesterone in the night before sleeping. Also she gave me at night valeriana roots to calm and sleep but honestly I don't take it yet. I am using a lot of Bach flowers pills and complex b during day to help my stress that now is very minimum if you compare wifh before this doctor. I have been in this regimen for 5 days and I see the difference the only thing that really worries me and is new is the heart palpitations that are caused by my hyperthyroidism. But menopause controlled well I think, getting there 😊 Don't let anyone tells you that you are going crazy if you know in your heart that is not correct, you know your body you know yourself keep looking for help and opinions. In my case this person that took possession of my body and mind wasn't me and I knew it, fight it try if you can avoiding antidepressants in my case using it was worse. It is true I have menopause and I went through a stressful time that probably caused all this to me but we don't change 360 we change but we know better. I know that it was also something also and keep saying it laud I asked to take all the test necessary to have piece of mind!!! Now I feel that I am in my way to recovery will be long thyroid specially hyperthyroidism is not a joke but you can't trust totally keep asking questions and sharing info is the only way to be safe. ??"

Guest,2017-10-17T14:59+00:00,Sick of peri,"I'm over it.  I've tried everything - take or don't take this supplement, eat or don't eat this food, get off sugar or have a little chocolate every day because life is short, get lots of exercise to lose weight or only a little so fatigue doesn't get worse, go to this or that doctor with a symptom, read this book, that website, etc.  It just goes on and on. I've decided that my gyn office is unreliable.  It's a big practice and they're always grouchy and overbooked when I go there.  The latest is that two different nurses gave me two different versions of lab results.  When I went in with dry mouth a couple of months ago, the gyn ordered lab work on A1C, TSH, FSH, LH, and Vitamin B12.  The web portal results were posted incorrectly, so I had to call to ask for the correct information.  The nurse told me that everything looked normal.  A few weeks went by and a different nurse called back out of the blue to say that the doctor had just looked at the report - yes, weeks later - and said my B12 was too high.  They told me to stop taking my vitamin supplements - I'd also been on Vitamin D because my GI doctor said my level was too low on that.  I have to go back to the gyn in a few weeks to get the B12 rechecked. Now that I'm off the supplements, the symptoms that they were suppressing are back with a vengeance.  I'm back to sleeping poorly, having that weird one-sided breast soreness that was gone, feeling sad and down all the time, and having severe bouts of fatigue.  I have a full-time job.  I am my sole support.  In my mind, I picture myself being able to wash the dishes and do the laundry and manage my life, but in reality it happens only sporadically because I am too lethargic to do more than what I absolutely have to do.   So everything gets done at the last minute, if it gets done at all, and sometimes I'm late to work and I have become unreliable in my own life.  Everything is more than I can manage.  I give up all my energy for the 40 hours a week when I'm working because I can't afford to lose my job.  Everything else comes a distant second. I know this is a rant.  I just had to get it all out somewhere where people will understand.  I try to talk to people close to me who might understand, but it doesn't help much.  Every now and then, I have a few minutes of clarity when I feel hopeful, but it never lasts.  I keep being told that peri is not a disease, too, and not to treat it like one, that it's just a phase that will come and go over time.  I want some way to feel better that doesn't involve another supplement, prescription, doctor visit, lab test, any or all of the above, and still be able to enjoy life, because it IS short."
mimi1125,2017-11-06T03:39+00:00,I've been bleesing 3 consecutive months when my blood test showed I am completely menapaused,"Hi, I am 52 years old and My blood work showed that I am definitely menaupaused about 3 months ago so I am not supposed to bleed my doc said but I've had periods with pure blood for 5 days at a time last three months so doctor tested me all kinds of test including endometrial biopsy, vaginal sonogram to check uterus, internal exam, blood test, etc.  They all came back normal but I just started another period from today.  But thing is I haven't had 12 months no period yet though.   Few months ago, I wasn't bleeding so doc gave me this horrible oral pills, progestron? so that I could bleed regularly but this med made me so crazy emotionally but I took them anyway for  two rounds but it never made me regular but then few months later I tested my blood work and it came back as total menopause so I went from no bleeding for few months at a time while I was not menapaused to bleeding every month for few months  now with blood work showing that I am menapaused.  I am confused why doctor is scaring me.  What else should I do?  He sounds like he ran out of text on me."

In July I had a fainting experience, sent to the cardiologist who after tests says your heart is grand but here are some beta blockers for the palpations and fainting thing.  6 weeks later I am getting very sick, I am in constant state of this falling feeling, vomiting etc.  I ended up in a&e 3 times and am told to go to ENT.   Head to ENT who tells me I have Meniere's disease, a lifelong, terminal disease!  I get sicker and sicker and finally take myself off beta blockers and I begin to improve - in two weeks I had lost a stone and my body was shutting down.  Now I am off them I can focus on what is really happening to my body and after reading your posts I believe it is the menopause.

danielle35642,2017-08-23T01:54+00:00,Is this all my doctor should do??,"My doctor must be distracted half the time. I let him know that I wanted blood work done because I'm starting menopause and having a lot of uncomfortable symptoms, wanted hormone levels tested so he would know what to recommend. After I had the bloodwork done he called to announce ""your test results show your starting to go through the change""....🙄 Brilliant-- I tell him yes, I was aware, if he recalled that I had let him know I was in menopause and that's why I wanted my hormones tested. His response was that ""your hormones confirm your going through the change""😖 Again, I state yes I realize that, could he go over the levels with me, and he said ok, well your estrogen is low. So, I can give you antidepressants... It was like pulling teeth-- having to explain what I thought already did, that I wanted to understand my hormone levels and how could he address that so I can feel better. He finally said ok he could prescribe Premarin...  is that all I needed to be tested for is low estrogen?? I thought there were other hormones and things to test for in order to best know how to address the symptoms-- but I don't know.. did he cover it pretty adequately?"
sharon71416,2017-11-03T15:35+00:00,Symptoms of menopause,"Hi all Have read loads on here and can relate to many of symptoms. Mine started 8 months ago when I had double vision following stress.  My parents had died within weeks of one another then my relationship ended after  7 years. The cause of my double vision was unknown possibly thyroid ( mine underactive) possible 3rd nerve palsy. It lasted around 9 days. Since then I developed night sweats waking me up 3x per night. Then they began in the day. Before my hot flush I would get impending doom as though something terrible was going to happen. These hot flashes come and go don’t get them every day. Then I developed health anxiety imagining I have something terrible. My energy has gone along with my social life. I used to be a real party animal now I don’t go out. I had to go part time from work as I could not cope with 5 days. I have had headaches, nausea, eyes ache had eczema on hands suddenly tinnitus, jaw ache, fingers ache, gastritis which made me loose 2 stone. Which I couldn’t afford as I am tiny anyway. The anxiety is dreadful I wake up and it’s there. I have tried meditation mindfulness yoga having CBT but it’s still there. My last period was 16 months ago and I’m 55. Can’t take HRT due to family history. I’m so emotional all the time just want to cry. I’ve never had anxiety like this until now. I don’t drink tea coffee or alcohol and I walk as often as I can and I went gluten free 8 months ago as I read it would help with thyroid antibodies. I’m not anaemic and other bloods are fine.  Any one relate to this ??"

abijah23843,2017-11-02T11:34+00:00,can nausea be a severe side effect of taking blood pressure medication,I am 53 and have been having very very serious bouts of nausea which has completely thrown me off balance. I have done so many tests with results all okay. No deficiencies in vitamins. Its soothing to know that this is one of the symptoms of menopause. My gynaecologist and gastroenterologisit have strongly adviced me not to use any hormonal therapy not because I have a medical challenge but because of the adverse side effects in the future. I am keenly looking at how to fight the nausea naturally. I started taking amlodipine besilate (5mg) medication this year January. Not quite long when I started I began to have numbness on my feet. I did several tests at the time and all results okay. I no longer have the numbness but now its horrible nausea. On further research I found out that nausea is one of the severe side effects of amlodipine. Please is anyone on amlodipine and is having serious bouts of nausea. Please respond as we all need to help ourselves

I just turned 50, and I cannot bear the emotional upheavals.  Everyday is different.  If I have a good day, I am worried about the next.  I have suffered from anxiety and OCD for 20 years, but have always been able to surmount my issues (with medication or self talk).  At the present, however, nothing seems to work.  For many years, I was only on a maintenance dose of Paxil (like 5 mg), with success.  However this past year has been quite difficult (aside from menopause issues).  I lost my father and we have some health concerns in my close family.  It was like a light went off.....and my issues have skyrocketed.  My doctor put me on 40 mg Paxil (which was the initial dose I took TWENTY years ago, when things were intense).  Initially, it seemed to help.  But it also comes with the side effect of insomnia, which is debilitating.  Therefore, it is hard to tell whether or not it is helping, since severe insomnia also complicates my issues.  Even my .5 mg of Ativan does not help the sleep situation (when it used to previously).  Thankfully I work for a venerable boss, who affords me great flexibility.  But even my low stress office job is becoming difficult to manage.  Just want to stay home, in my cocoon...and watch stupid tv.  I hate being this way.  Began seeing a therapist to manage the anxiety and OCD.  He is still in the process of ""unpeeling"" me.....and we have yet to begin CBT.  In the meantime I am devouring self help books and meditating (via headspace).  I guess I am just seeking a kind ear from you ladies.  Trying to hide most of this from my lovely husband, who would never understand my monkey mind.  Poor guy."

sharcerv52408,2016-03-21T14:33+00:00,Gas and bloating in Chest area,Hi Ladies! I was wondering if any of you ever experience having chest discomfort that feels like gas? It sometimes migrates into the shoulder or back and the arm. I usually experience this during ovulation and or right before a period. Sometimes it can feel like trapped gas. That's the best way to describe it. I am concerned because I heard that sometimes gas in the chest area can be heart related so I asked for a referral to a Cardiac doctor. Anyone experience this before?
kerry91,2014-06-14T06:10+00:00,Cortisol and the menopause,"Thought I'd share what I've read with you ladies. Apparently when our estrogen levels are normal it keeps cortisol (the stress hormone) in check, but when the levels of estrogen drop the cortisol gets out of control. Sustained high cortisol levels destroy healthy muscle and bone, slow down healing and normal cell regeneration, co-opt biochemicals needed to make other vital hormones, impair digestion, metabolism and mental function, interfere with healthy endocrine function; and weaken your immune system. High cortisol can effect adrenal function.  Adrenal fatigue may be a factor in many related conditions, including fibromyalgia, hypothyroidism, chronic fatigue syndrome, arthritis, premature menopause and others. It may also produce a host of other unpleasant symptoms, such as brain fog, acne and hair loss. This more or less describes what women are going through here. The good news is you can control it, diet helps, things you need to avoid include coffee, chocolate, sugar and alcohol . Omega 3's help but you also need to avoid stress (or learn to handle it better), I've been using a great deep breathing technique developed by doctor David O'hare, you can find it on Youtube."

liz67338,2017-10-30T20:58+00:00,Lack of understanding at Work with menopause,"Hi ladies, I wondered if anyone has had success in gaining support at work with menopause symptoms? What they have done or what has happened for them? Or even external legal advice or be in a profession where they are able to give advice on this? After many many months of trials test errors and suffering, i now know without question that it's lack of ventilation that magnifies my issues/ a multitude of debilating symptoms and our office doesn't have enough air flow and the upcoming winter months will be much worse again as heating gets turned up so whenever I'm there within minutes my symptoms become progressively worse. I really need to work from home for 90% of time over winter to lessen my suffering but keep getting asked to be in office more (male dominant sales team) despite explaining time after time how ill i become in office ((i once collapsed in ladies from a full blown panic attack after pushing myself too hard to try and fight the symptoms) I'm still very capable of my job and enjoy it but when I get the symptoms it's almost impossible to do my job.

The Obs & Gynae doctor who I happened to be seeing today now says I need another Hysteroscopy ( terrifying as I have a Spinal Anaesthesia) & if they cannot remove the fibroid I have to go for some resection thing which may end up being a Hysterectomy.  I wish I had mentioned the anger & sore boobs before the bleed, to illustrate the fact that it was probably hormonal.  grrr!!  She will probably take me off HRT after this which means my life will be hell all over again. I know they have to follow guidelines for cancer risk but I really don't want this done.

I called the GP who to be fair was very sympathetic but offered me a pill to take on top of my HRT that I have to take for 3 days before my bleed is due and continue until I return.  I am a little concerned at the overload of hormones and wondered if there is a way to tweak pills. Maybe miss some green and start white ones early to have an early bleed.  Would this even work?

Quick history; Preimenopause from 2012 (hot flushes, night sweats, aching joints, brain fog, tired etc).  Tried Fluoexetine for 18 months to combat night sweats, when that stopped working I started Climagest 1mg, when that stopped working after about a year it was increased to Climagest 2mg which has worked fine for over a year now. I went to collect my prescription on Friday last week (Climagest 2mg) and the pharmacist informed me that Climagest is no longer available - he had been in touch with my docs for an alternative but hadn't heard back.  I had an appointment yesterday anyway as I have had a pain in my left breast (no lumps) that I wanted to get check out.  She said she would consult another doctor about which hrt to switch to.  I had a call this morning to say they still hadn't sorted it out.  I am down to my last tablet tonight, so I need to pick up a prescription tomorrow. I have been trying to research it myself,  I have come across the other types of HRT that are available (continuous combined HRT for no bleeds) and Tibolone.  These are both for post menopause (no bleeds for a year).  But as I am on a sequential HRT, that means I get a bleed every month whether I want one or not.  So when will I be considered postmenopause?  Do I just get a blood test or do I need to stop the HRT and see if I bleed?  These are questions my doctor couldn't answer yesterday as she knew nothing about HRT.  My regular doctor is on maternal leave and the 12 year old replacement is lovely, but clueless. If it is a faff to change from a sequential to a continuous combined or tibolone, what are the alternatives to climagest?  My husband informs me that I have become very angry whilst on climagest LOL so I thought it might be time for a switch? ANY help or advice would be much appreciated and then I will ring the doctors and do battle with my findings! Thanks Mel"

I can only describe it as a sudden jolt which I have no control over and I have never read about anyone experiencing twitches in their hands on this site.  My health anxiety is at an all time high as I struggle to cope and feel terrified about these symptoms.   Does anyone else experience these problems? Should I see my doctor even though he seems clueless about peri menopausal symptoms.   Thank you ladies.  💐🌺🌷"

I went to see a lung specialist on yesterday , she did 2 echos and ultrasound and everything was normal. I did a chest x ray also and it was normal Although my cardiologist sent me there because of the pleural effusion he thought he saw on lungs but she nothing. She said whatever fluid was there is GONE now. I was due for a period a few days ago but so far no period . Ive been having shortness of breath if talking chest feels so uncomfortable. I do have Gerd also, I dont know what is this about. I can just sit and i would get hot and start breating like im trying to catch my breath. I havent been able to sleep well either. This is very disturbing to me. I dont lnow if its hormonal related or what?"

So far they haven't and I am getting increasingly concerned. My general mood is very low, I cry at the drop of a hat and I feel exhausted. Not tired but like I can't put one foot in front of the other. I have the need to wee straight after I have passed urine and it doesn't go away.

pammied,2017-10-18T07:55+00:00,Returning Symptoms,"Hi All I had my last period about 5 years ago and I am now 58. At that time and for about 18 months afterwards, I had some of the menopause symptoms including mild hot flushes, disturbed sleep, bloating, some weight gain and mild low moods. I considered myself lucky from what I had heard from friends that my menopause was relatively easy. I was very grateful. However, in the last 6 months I have seen some health issues that I did not connect to menopause until watching a tv article today. My sleep has become very poor - most nights I am having very broken sleep, sometimes only getting 2-3 hours. I have also been getting some aching joints and general tiredness and malaise. Plus an almost constant dull headache. But, one of the most concerning issues has been abnormal heart palpitations. I have seen the cardiologist and did have an electrical fault. This has now been corrected but I am still getting high levels of ectopic beats which cannot be corrected. I am wondering whether there could be a link to menopause despite it having happened over 5 years ago? Any thoughts? Thanks."

I of course googled (note to self  -YOU ARE AN IDIOT) and upset my day completely. ?I've got in to docs tomorrow but I suppose I'm looking for a bit of reassurance. Instinct says get it checked.

It has been so helpful and lovely to find fellow followers with similar ailments. Saturday night I enjoyed a very good nights sleep 😴.  It made such a difference to my day yesterday.  Had so much energy and actually achieved so much. It lulled me into a false sense of security and I actually believed that I would again sleep well last night............Oh NO, not at all, back to constantly waking up numerous times. Joints aching, legs restless, got up to use the loo twice, just could not setttle and get comfortable.  Just as I thought I was drifting off, my OCD kicked in and I had to get up to check that the tumble drier was turned off!

Knowing my test results were also to be sent to  my family dr, I made an appt to see her next week.

izzy70,2017-10-12T10:10+00:00,Change of HRT,"I had not long turned 46 - May last year. When I was 'diagnosed' as going through the menopause. I had went to the Doc as I was going to bed at night and suddenly going  freezing cold (down to my bones!) to boiling hot. It was affecting my sleep as it was waking me up at night. I though maybe I had an infection. I had been missing the odd period but was still getting them most of the time. I was also feeling depressed and confused and just generally in some kind of fog. Bloods were taken and it came back that my FSH levels were very high. I had hit perimenopause big time. I was given Evorel Sequi patches as my GP said that due to my age and it's relatively early onset, I had best protect myself from osteoporosis and heart disease etc. The patches calmed the temperature extremes down so that was good. Nearly 18 months down the line and I found myself back at my GP this week. The same female GP I had seen the year earlier. Only I found her noticeably less sympathetic. The heat extremes had started again and I felt depressed and anxious. I have suffered bouts of depression for years though and explained to the Doc that I didn't know if it was my usual common or garden depressionor because of the Menopause. I told her I had no confidence, felt terribly depressed, was on the brink of packing my job in the day before as I felt I couldn't cope. Also that I felt really ugly, old and washed up as a woman. She just wasn't as understanding and supportive. It was as if she doubted me. ""What was your intention in coming along...what were you expecting""? she asked me. I told her I just wanted advice. If it was my clinical depression taking a turn for the worse or was it because the patches weren't doing it for me anymore. If it was the former I told her I'd just try and live with it. But if it were the latter then couldn't we try another HRT. Surely I didn't have to suffer this? She eventually gave me Elleste Duet 2mg tablets to try for 3 months. I said that at least we would know if they made me feel better then it was the Menopause. I understand that it's best for us to stay on a low dose and that there are dangers of being on a higher dose - but surely she could have afforded me a bit more sympathy? I felt she just couldn't be bothered! I needed a bit more support! This is not something we can discuss with anyone. We need a professionals advice and guidance surely? I just felt let down and and as if she didn't believe me. Unless of course, this is the Menopause talking and yet another symptom of how I'm feeling?  Has anyone had a similar experience? I wonder if the new increased dose really will make a difference and how long it'll take to work given that I had already been on patches of 1mg? Totally fed up and feel as if nobody understands this. From an ugly washed up old single woman of 47 :-( Cause that's how I feel x"
