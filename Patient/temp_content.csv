elle127,2016-02-29T21:18+00:00,Help....cant deal with these symptoms!,"Hi ladies, Where do i start? 4 years ago i started HRT and felt great on it. Then i had a scan and found i have fibroids so was advised to come off. Ive been HRT free now for a year. I didnt really notice any problems until a few months ago. Ive always had regular periods but twice now ive started on my 21st day instead of my usual 28/30 days. My most recent period was painful like contractions although the blood is thinner and watery now. The fatigue is horrendous. I couldnt cope and was actually off work and in bed i felt so bad. Long story short.....i went to the doctor who repeated my bloods which again came back as ""normal""!. I know my body and im far from normal at the moment. My doctor said i could go back on HRT to help my symptons but i didnt want to as i would need a HRT which would give me a bleed each month. I want to continue natuarally and see when my periods stop. Has anyone else experienced the painful periods im having and terrible fatigue. I just cant cope like this each month. But i cant stay off work all the time. Any help or advice would be much appreciated. Also suffering with mood swings and bad bloating. Help!! Elaine."

Daisy03,2016-03-10T07:36+00:00,Multivitamins,"This is a general question and I am not after advice on certain brands and don't want to promote any. But I have only realised recently that I am going through peri, and found my answer to many aches and pains..... Would it be useful to try multivitamins? When I had my daughter 6 years ago, I was 40 and my hormones were over the place for a long time. I've probably started peri then. I was so desperate and kept asking doctors to check my hormones they haven't and said it wouldn't show me anything significant! Anyway, my husband suggested multivitamins and they helped. The doctor said it was likely to be placebo effect and that I had issues with anxiety and was healthy otherwise. I feel now similar to how I felt then and wondered about going back on multivitamins. My question is what type? Do I try just general ones or do I try some specifically for meno?"

As soon as I wake up in the morning, I have the worst thoughts about all sorts of things, family issues, bad things in the news, etc., and I feel doomed as though things will never get better and usually want to cry.  Once I get up to start the day, it passes but only very gradually.  Does anything help this?"

I have been on biodentical hormones for about 6 weeks now and they have greatly improved my many symptoms. Around 4 weeks ago I started getting extremely, dizzy, constant headache as if I was shaking inside about 20 mins after my nightly progesterone. I stopped about 12 days ago and everything got better. I know I need progesterone as I have a womb and don't want a hysterectomy but my GP cannot help, pharmacy say speak to prescriber and consultant who prescribed is unavailable always and I'm not due for an appointment till July. I just don't know what to do, I read somewhere that if progesterone is not tolerated then it's sufficient to take for 1st 7 days of the month, I think I could tolerate that.

Heavy bleeding but since January bleeding has calmed down and just brown light period. Since two days now I'm having lower dull abdominal pain, bloating gas. Nausea. I do suffer from gastric problems since a young age tho. I Went to doctor he did a scan on my abdomen yesterday but couldn't find anything and actually he says the fibroids have shrunk to 2 cm. And I ask him to check ovaries and he said ovaries is fine too. No cysts..Any idea if this pain is from the fibroids dying, as he says they do with menopause? I'm so worried.

Anyway, today I was craving some chocolate ice cream, I had a scoop. Well, 3 hours later, my breast and chest started HURTING and even burning and swelling. I also felt super dry mouth and really thirsty, my blood sugars went up really high.  I feel really angry that I cannot even have a small treat of ice cream, its so unfair and I know I sound like a little kid and there are foods that are tasty and good too, it seems unfair that our bodies have done this to us before menopause even with my diabetes I could have an occassional treat, but since menopause I cannot even have an occassional treat as it relates to a small candy bar or a brownie. I dont want to go overboard but now and then. I see where a lot of ladies say menopause and peri screw your blood sugars up and my doctor told me the same thing. So, thats the end of ice cream.

Snowbell1975,2016-03-09T16:15+00:00,Any experience with estrogen in peri?,"Hi everyone,  I had a question about estrogen. I was given progesterone to take without being tested. After a few months, I was feeling awful (dizzy, heart palps, very short of breath, depression and anxiety went thru the roof). Took it upon myself to do saliva testing and when I got the results back, my progesterone levels were sky high, and estrogen was in the very low normal catagory. My Progesterone to estrogen levels (as you can imagine) are out of balance. My doc just told me to quit using the progesterone cream for awhile and I quit cold turkey. Not advisable by the way, I felt like I was going thru a drug withdrawal. Anyhoo, I couldn't stand the depression and anxiety any longer and felt like I needed some estrogen. I bought some bioidentical estriol cream and used the lowest dose, and for the past few days, I have felt like a person agian. I still have a uterus and know that any estrogen needs to be balanced out with progesterone, but since my levels are so elevated, and I felt like crap while taking it, I don't know what to do. My doc is so unwilling to give me anything, as she thinks my hormones are not that imbalanced. (I certainly feel like they are badly imbalanced, anyone who deals with horrible depression, dizziness and anxiety knows this) Does anyone here with peri have any experience taking estrogen, while still having a uterus?  I am at my wits end and want to have more good days like I have had but dont' want to risk hurting myself just taking estrogen."

The gas pain and bloating felt like stabbing pains and put me into tears yesterday. I had to take GasX and ibuprofen to get rid of it yesterday. I do have an ovarian cyst, but have had it for years and never had issues with ovulation pain until peri started. In addition to the pain, right after ovulation, my anxiety jumps thru the roof, then my mood can get low. Anybody else going thru this?"

I started crying after as a big fat wall of worry and anxiety hit me and my poor hubby was worried about me too. I felt such a disaster and couldnt help worry there is something wrong. I gave myself a common sense talking to but still feel unsettled. Being in peri knocks your sex drive anyway I find and we arent as ""active"" as we used to be for that reason and this is another reason i was upset as the one time i felt attractive for a bit it all went wrong as it was so uncomfy. I will pop to Docs for a check up but i was really worried so thought id ask all the lovely ladies here to see if anyone can help?

Anna_Fraser,2016-03-05T21:53+00:00,HRT experiences,"Hi everyone, I'm 46. After 3 years of battling with all the typical peri menopausal symptoms, tests having rules out everything other than a little mild wear and tear in joints in hips and left foot (osteo arthritus - which they say is typical for anyone my age), a specialist has recommended HRT. No period now for 4 months, prior to that, every 2 weeks, and before that, another absonce of 5 months, so, they are all over the place. I'm otherwise very healthy. I've tried so many natural alternatives, and not a lot of significant relief from the symptoms; joint aches and pains, headaches, irritability, hair loss, feeling the heat, tiredness, depression.... Regular exercise has helped though, although I can no longer run, and even walking hurts, so limiting to cycling and swimming. Also, Citravescent Vit C + natural sea salt seemd to help a little. But I am desperate to go back to feeling like my old self, and am prepared to give HRT a try. I know there is so much controversy out there about HRT, and also many people who will point to Bio-identical HRT. However, have spoken to a few specialists about this, and done a fair bit of research, aparantly, the Bio HRT still uses the same hormones, but have not undergone the same stringent testing procedures by the FDA as the regular HRT's. So, am likely to stay away from these. I would be really interested to hear your experiences with HRT; what were you on, if you had any of the above symptoms - particulalry joint aches and pains, has it helped, how long before they started to work, what were side effects etc? I am nervous as typically don't do well on any medication. When I was on different pills in my 20's, I would always have unpleasant side effects. Two years ago I tried the Mirena IUD, and I hated that...felt depressed, sore boobs like I was pregnant, and felt bloated. All pain killers (like ibuprofen, tremmadol etc) make me feel like rubbish the next day. So if I try HRT, I may start off on low doses, but will let specialst figure that one out :-) It would be great to hear your experiences..."
jamie50513,2016-03-05T16:06+00:00,A Little Help Please,"Hello Ladies, I am always researching to find better ways to cope with our changing and raging hormones. I stopped googling and researching things that do nothing but drive my anxiety down the runway to losing my mind. We have enough on our plates to deal with. I know that what might work for you may not work for someone else as we are all different, but I came across some useful information that just may help someone. Use it to your specifications, research it if you'd like, but I just wanted to put it out here. Vitamin A- 5,000 iu- acts as a antioxidant, improves skin health, regulates bone remodeling. Vitamin B- 50 to 100 mg- relieves pms, relieves hot flushes, enhances mood, improves memory. Vitamin C- 500 mg twice a day- acts as an antioxidant, improves memory, increases collagen in skin. Vitamin E- 400 to 800 iu- acts as antioxidant, relieves hot flushes, improves memory, reduces wrinkles. Calcium- 300 mg twice a day- relieves pms, decreases heart palpatations. Magnesium- 300 mg twice a day- relieves pms, reduces fatigue, increases feeling of well being, may prevent migraine headaches, decreases heart palpitations. Evening primrose oil- 1,000 mg one to three times a day- relieves hot flushes, relieves menstrual problems, relieves anxiety, improves mood. Phosphatidyl serine- 100 to 300 mg- improves concentration, improves memory, relieves depression. Black Cohosh- 50 mg twice a day- improves irregular bleeding, relieves pms, relieves hot flushes, relieves insomnia. Chasteberry- capsule or liquid follow the suggested dose- improves irregular bleeding, increases LH, thereby increasing progesterone and protecting against unopposed oestrogen. Ginkgo Biloba- 30 to 50 mg three times a day- improves mood, improves short term memory, improves concentration, stimulated libido. Liquorice- 500 mg daily- reduces heavy bleeding, has mild phyto-oestrogen properties. St.John's Wort- consult your GP if taking any scripted meds before taking 300 to 500 mg daily- relieves insomnia, relieves depression, reduces anxiety, stimulates libido. Again, I just thought I would share some of the info i've found. Hopefully something here will be helpful for someone."

Daisy03,2016-03-04T17:57+00:00,What affects your symptoms? What helps?,As I have mentioned in my previous post I am only coming to realise that some of the physical / emotional difficulties I have experienced might be hormones related and that I am most likely starting peri menopause. I have noticed if I drink red wine (and even one glass) or fizzy drinks even the diet ones or if I eat too much sugar then some of my symptoms are noticeable worse. So I wondered if anybody else have noticed something similar. Is there any food that makes your symptoms worse? And have you experienced that by avoiding such good improves how you feel? What works for you? And what makes you feel worse?

My periods are much more heavier than ever before, I start spotting around day 18 just very slightly and start period between day 24-26, 2-3 days are incredibly heavy sometimes with clots than one day spotting . My hormones seem to be all over the place and during my period and during ovulation I seem to experience quite a bit of joint aches and stiffness, anxiety which then leads into low mood. My anxiety is health related so all these aches and pains make me feel like There is something serious wrong with me. Once the hormones calm down I become my old self. I feel like my body is out of sync. Then when period is over, I feel normal over. I don't feel like I want to get into medication so would love to find some natural way of dealing with the symptoms. Those this sound like peri menopausal? If so, how long does this phase last? My mum got through menopause at 54. Can I control some of these symptoms through diet or some natural products? I would be grateful for any advice. Many thanks x"

My blood pressure is high so i've been put on medication for that as of this morning. GP asked if i have migraine with aura to which i answered yes but rarely, perhaps 1 or 2 a year - and he said i'm sorry but i can't prescribe HRT for you as you may have a stroke. My world just fell in, i don't think its sunk in yet. He said i could go down the herbal route but anything containing oestrogen would put me at risk of a stroke....

tmpearce,2016-02-28T19:11+00:00,Does HRT help with menopause digestive issues?,"Hi ladies, I am 54 years old and 3 1/2 months post hysterectomy with ovaries left in.  For a few years I have suffered with digestive problems which I'm sure are menopause related.  Some times I feel like I have too much stomach acid and other times like there isn't enough.  My stomach feels full easily and it feels like the food just sits there in a lump.  Had some tests done which were normal about 1 1/2 years ago.  Finally found a GI doctor who actually acknowledged gastro problems exist in menopausal women!  My family doctor and gyn Doctor both say they don't recognize the connection.  Next week I'm havin a gastric emptying study and in two weeks an endoscopy and colonoscopy.  I hope and pray these are all ok. Anyway...sorry about all the info.....my question is...does anyone know if taking HRT helps with the digestive issues?  I am one of the lucky ones who doesn't really have hot flashes.  I do suffer from anxiety, tiredness and when I don't feel well I start feeling such doom and gloom...like my life is over.   This whole ""to do or not to do"" HRT is very confusing to me.  I do know that if I do, it would be bio identicals. thanks so much for your help with this concern.  These message boards are a lifesaver!"

For example: conventional medicine will look at a blood sugar result of 103 as normal because that number is not quite warranted in treating it with meds. Whereas, a Naturopathic Dr will say RED FLAG...RED FLAG....your sugar is high lets get it down by doing such and such... I had just a couple of things come back on my labs that I just wanted to know what the cause is from being high. I know that right now I am in the beginning of Hypothyroidism. But, my number on my Thyroglobulin Antibodies was 2 IU and they want it to be 1 or less. What is this test exactly? The other one was The Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies and that number is 18 and the reference range says it needs to be less than 9. The other test that they said was normal was my FSH test which my number said 36.8 but the reference ranges says, Follicular phase, (2.5-10.2)mid cycle peak(3.1-17.7), Luteal Phase(1.5-9.1) and Post Menopausal which that reference range says 23.0-116.4 which by my number, I fall into that category but I'm not post yet.

I am also hypothyroid and my thyroid levels have been off for a couple months and we are trying to get those back to normal.  In the past 8 months I've been having dizziness and my ENT says I have vestibular dysfunction and will be starting rehab theray to help with it.  Its a feeling of rocking sensation when I'm sitting, standing, walking, I have it quite a bit.  In the past month or two i've noticed when I have some hotflashes and night sweats, not everytime  but more than before I will get very dizzy and off balance as the hot flash is coming on, sometimes they only last a few seconds, but today it seemed to go on for mins, so of course my anxiety set it.  Now that the anxiety is here the dizziness continues just at a lower level.  i had to take a xanax to get myself to calm down.  I used to have just the normal hot flash and then this started, also the flashed are more intense sometime to the point of just plain soaked, this happen during the day and alot at night, my night sweats have gotten to the point where i sometimes have to change clothes.   I do have anxiety disorder and mostly about my health, so when the vertigo started it came back with a vengence.  Do anyone have any advise or help they can offer.  I would appreciated it.

BugglyBot,2016-02-18T18:45+00:00,Sore Head,"I hope some of you ladies can relate to me here. I went for my hair colouring/cutting, etc, today and my head was agony. I've not banged or knocked it but if I didn't know any better, I'd swear my scalp was covered in bruises. As soon as my hairdresser started dividing my hair, I could have screamed and when she washed it after the colouring, I literally had to grit my teeth. It doesn't hurt ordinarily, but if you rub it or try to massage, it's painful. I think I've had this before but never felt it this bad, although I think it was the hairdresser having to manipulate my scalp. I can brush it okay. It is bizarre and is worrying me. My scalp has changed such a lot recently. It's itched like mad when the colder weather set in at the end of last year, (I do get this to a degree though, apparently some people's skin acts as a barometer, even before the cold temperatures hit. Fingers crossed, I've had no headaches..just this strange bruised like feeling. I can't gauge my periods so don't know if it's connected to PMS symptoms or not. Has anyone else had something similar?"

jamie50513,2016-02-22T12:10+00:00,Age...Is it a big deal???,"Hello Ladies, I'm here with yet another rant. I really am glad I found this forum and the ladies here are very helpful, understanding, supportive, and always ready to give helpful advice. I really appreciate you all. However, there is something that disturbs me. I read a lot of post and I post a lot to get insight and see if anyone else experience these symptoms and sensations. The question I see a lot is asking how old a person is. I am fairly young (38), but that doesn't mean that I am not peri/meno because I'm not in my 50's or 40's or vice versa in thinking that because someone is over 50 that they should be in meno or post. I've done quite a bit of research and while I am not an expert, I saw that this can start for some women in their mid to late 30's and can go on for many years well past their 50's. It nerves me to assume that because someone is not of the age you think they should be, that their symptoms are not peri/meno. I can't speak for the ladies here, only for myself in saying I have had plenty of bloods, scans, you name it, and it all comes back normal. That is a good thing, so I can rule out many things and put mines down to hormones. I say all of that to say ladies come here for support, I certainly do. But please don't make assumptions that because someone is older or younger that they are not expierencing peri/meno. It's stressful enough dealing with these issues, and its even harder when you are blown off because of your age and what people think it should be. Every women's expierences are different but that doesn't mean they are not going through the same things as you. Don't mean to come off as angry or offensive. Just want us to all be supportive of each other."

I have to gently pop my ears to stop it but seconds later, it will start up again. I've just been chatting to hubby, and couldn't answer him at one point as the rumbling was making me panic. After one of the times I popped my ears, I had that cold rush that seems to come from the centre of my chest and radiates out. It only lasts for a second or so but it's there all the same. I can go for months without the rumbling and then it starts up again. It really is frightening sometimes.  My ears have always been sensitive, certain roads with inclines give me pressure so I pop my ears to relieve it. Has anyone else suffered this and is there anything I could do to stop it?"

Guest,2016-02-20T01:09+00:00,Had the worse OB/GYN visit EVER!,"I went to see a new OB/GYN yesterday (mine moved out of the area) to get Mirena IUD consultation and possibly get it removed. In another post I mentioned many of the symptoms that has led me to believe that I am at the beginning stages of perimenopause. I also inquired of that to the OB/GYN and the whole visit was a joke! When she heard all my symptoms, she made me feel like I was being dramatic and would say things like ""I'm not a specialist in Psychiatry and I dont treat anxiety and depression!"" She would also say things like, ""In my 16 years of experience, Ive never had any woman come in and complain about any of the symptoms you have and think its the Mirena."" If you go to the Mirena website and look at ALL the possible side effects, you will see mood changes and depression! She was so defensive of this type of birth control, i was like what is going on with the lady?? Then on top of that, when I would ask her a question, she would say ""I don't know"" alot! I'm just sitting there in her office in tears, thinking to myself ""ok, if you have 16 years of experience, shouldn't you be able to answer my questions??"" I then told her that I am NOW even more confused because I didn't get any answers and that I'll talk to my husband and think about it before I remove it. She then said if I didn't want a birth control with hormones, I could get the Paragard and gave me a brochure. She didn't care that I was in tears not even handing me a tissue. She definitely showed she didn't care, had no empathy, didn't listen to my needs, and was very cold and heartless. Then later, I found out from my husband (who was waiting for me in the waiting area) that he saw many brochures on the table about the practice and that they highly supported the Mirena. So this OB/ GYN apparently endorses and most likely gets a financial cut to recommend this type of birth control to women. So it made total sense as to why she acted the way she did! She must have gotten her feelings hurt and defended the Mirena. It makes me so sick that Dr's put their pay first BEFORE the needs of their patients. When I got home later I looked up info on women who had their Mirena removed and about 95% of the posts I read, these women were so much happier after they had it taken out. Many of them complained that they suffered from anxiety and depression like symptoms after they had the Mirena put in (even months or years after). I've had mine just over one year and I am having it removed for sure, just not with that worthless OB/GYN I saw. Thankfully I found out that my Primary care physician or GP does women wellness care and can remove my Mirena. I have an appointment with her this Monday and will finally be rid of this IUD. Doing this will help me to determine if it is the Mirena that has caused me to feel my perimenopause symptoms or not. Process of elimination.I'll keep you posted. Anyone else have a similar experience?"

That was a Monday. Wednesday I got my period and went downhill from there. I bleed heavy and my iron level has gone down. I saw a hematologist who said it was definitely menstral related so now I'm taking iron supplements. I went back to the chiropractor that Thursday night and he used some tool on my pelvic area to get that back to normal and then I started having pain when sitting and had bad weakness in my left leg to where I couldn't go up and down steps without my knee buckling. Went to my primary doctor and he ordered xrays which didn't show anything skeletal. Also gave me script to have a pelvic ultrasound done because I had told him I had an ovarian cyst on that side. I still have to have that done. I have a gyno appt tomorrow. Question is, if anyone had experience with an ovarian cyst, did you have pain near your hip, like it would hurt to sit for too long.

nicola06347,2016-02-17T05:28+00:00,Menopause (Peri) or Neurological,"I posted sometime ago that I had a brain cyst and intense burning in my head and I was waiting to see a Neurologist. At the time I wondered whether the burning sensation was hormone related. I've since seen a Neurologist who had advised that a cyst can just be a space in the brain filled with fluid, not necessarily a growth filled with fluid. In my case it appears that prior to birth I had a stroke which killed off part of the brain, left a gap which fills with CSF fluid. None of this has left me brain damaged (although my husband says this is questionable). But all that said the Neurologist didn't really know what the burning was caused by, he thought maybe a combination of anxiety and menopause and it should disappear over time. Anyone had the same experience?"

I have been having bouts all day on and off nervous stomach and jitters. I am literally trembling. I'm trying to lye back on my bed and relax but these jitters are annoying. I have been keeping down the panic attacks as best I can so that I don't stress myself out. These symtpoms are overwhelming. I could cry right now but I won't allow myself to break down like that. I'm determined to get through this. I'm sorry for my woes ladies but I had to talk to someone so I typed it out here. I'm so grateful for this forum and you ladies."

NuttyNan,2016-02-18T07:04+00:00,When & where is the end?!,"Hi Ladies, hope you're doing ok. My visit to the Dr today hasn't revealed anything new, latest blood test result are ok, only showed I'm low in vitamin D with a result number of 40, apparently should be 70+. Told her I stopped Livial as my BP went up & I started feeling really wierd, swimmy floaty sensations...my whole body just doesn't feel right. Anxiety is screwing me up too, as for the low blood sugar feelings....no answers 😕 I have had these sensations on & off in varying intensities over the last 2yrs but eased off when I first started Livial but then became a daily thing(on Livial for 3mths)now taking/trying a magnesium supplement which also has B6 & a vitaminD tablet, I'm living in hope this will calm everything otherwise I don't know what to do anymore....I just don't feel well anymore, I'm off balance/woozy & scared s****less,sorry, I'll never be well again, I can't & don't want to live like this. I don't have a life & hubby has had enough. I've never had issues with anxiety like this before OMG! does it ever end? I don't react well to antiDs & prefer something natural. Maybe I'll just have to ride it out & keep hoping I will be well again. Thought being in menopause I'd feel well & able to get on with life but every day is governed by how I feel 😢 Take care lovelies"

dunnit,2016-02-06T23:03+00:00,Menopause Survivor,"Hi Girls, It's difficult to know where to start.  I had always been reasonably fit and healthy and had been quite thin all my life.  About 7 years ago a routine smear test showed a small cervical cyst, trip to the gynaecologist who told me during the procedure that I was perimenopausal.  Never heard of it and confused it with menopausal and, as I had no symptoms, I thought I was just going to sail through. Big mistake.  Shortly afterwards I developed a strange symptom that I haven't come across in this forum or anywhere  else - smelly feet.  Now this might seem trivial but my feet could clear a room, the smell was strong and sickly sweet and no amount of showering, bathing or deodorant would stop it.  I lost count of the pairs of shoes I had to get rid of because the smell transferred to them.  It stopped at the time of what turned out to be my last menses in March 2010 to be replaced with the REAL symptoms.I piled on 2 stones in weight in next to no time and looked and felt  like a badly stuffed pillow with bulges back and front and thighs that a body builder would be proud of.  My stomach was painful under the strain of bloating and I felt generally under the weather.  Mother Nature (The Bitch!) still had lots of plans for me.  I started with migraine, something  I had never experienced before, they were happening 2 or 3 times a week and the Migraleve recommended by my local chemist was not really effective.  I had problems with painful joints - particularly my hands when my fingers would swell to the size of sausages.  So my husband shipped me off to see the GP who was surprisingly unhelpful. She told me there was nothing she could prescribe for migraine that was any more effective than the OTC Migraleve and referred me for an Xray on my right hand.  When I rang for the Xray result I was told the doctor didn't  need to see me again - and she hasn't.  I felt I was being treated as a neurotic attention seeker. The hot flushes and night sweats were in full swing and it was time to decide whether I was going to live with the menopause or was the menopause going to live with me? I tackled the migraine with paracetamol combined with a travel sickness tablet (Kwells) to deal with the awful headache and nausea and found out this really worked for me.  My husband helped out and  came home with a copper bracelet and vast amounts of Glucosamine gel. He looked up different supplements and vitamins and I tried things like black cohosh, St. John's wort and a host of others including Evening Primrose.  The combination I came up with was  A minimum of 1gm timed release Vitamin C - useful for weakness, bleeding gums, bruising, joint pain and energy Basic multivit with iron Vitamin D helps with absorbing calcium Vitamin B complex 15mg Zinc (well, who wants to catch a cold ?) But I found the best effect was when I added Sage capsules (300mg twice a day)  the hot flushes went from twice a day to about twice a week and they didn't last as long I didn't change much diet-wise although I did find that red meat slowed down my digestion which could cause constipation so I made sure I ate a couple of small easy-peel clementines every day.  The potassium in a daily banana helped regulate my heart rate, I found the knock on effect was my anxiety levels went down.  Under no circumstances would I give up chocolate... Practical issues for dealing with hot flushes and night sweats for me included wearing lots of lightweight layers that can be removed quickly  ( you don't want to be struggling to get a tight sweater over your head when your body is steaming).  Get a dual control electric blanket, keep your side switched off.  Ditch the nightie and sleep au naturel,  kick off the covers as soon as you feel the hosepipe has been turned on. My lovely husband helped me a lot, but I think he struggled a bit with the mood swings and the tears that came from nowhere and there were times when I felt I was the loneliest person in the world. Okay, that was then but this is now... I realised months ago that I couldn't remember when I last had a hot flush, a skirt I bought when the weight piled on dropped down to my knees, my side of the electric blanket is now switched on at night.   I feel better physically and mentally than I have for years, the lethargy and anxiety has lifted.  I can run up the stairs now instead of dragging myself up. There is little or no support professionally for the menopause and no handbook could ever be written to guide us through it.  I can't say that anything I've written will help you through, I hope it does.  But there are things that I can say with confidence - it really does not last forever and in the not too distant future there will be lots of you writing on this forum as ""Menopause Survivors""  Good luck and a big hug to you all"

I am 44, some slight changes in my periods over last couple of years, currently much lighter (long may THAT last), but the main symptoms I am having are: extreme tiredness (on and off), lethargy, horrible mood swings - irritable, angry, crying, and depression. I'm not having the hot flashes, skin problems or anything like that (Though now I think of it, general nasal and eye dryness, which I have had to use saline/hyrpmellose for). I do have painful ovulation, which has worsened over the past year, and have had a hysteroscopy to rule out anything sinister related to that! :-) I have some small fibroids, which my gynae sugegsted the Mirena coil or pill for, but I haven't gone down that road yet - only one was ever visible from an ulytrasound and that has actually SHRUNK over the past two years. What I am interested in is hearing what has worked for others? Currently I'm starting a supplement that contains black cohosh, agnus castus, ipriflavone and vitamin D3, along with a high dose vitamin B complex. I've also just signed up for an app as whilst awake in bed last night it occurred to me that SURELY there must be an app for this ;-) I thought it would be useful to track the symptoms alongside my cycle, and if nothing else maybe identify patterns that would help me to be prepared!!

My flushes have subsided and I think Im through the worst of it.  A year ago I had a small amount of blood in my urine and ended up having a scan which showed uterine thickening, then a biopsy which was normal. Today I noticed a pink tinge on my toilet tissue after having a pee ....sorry to be so graphic. No pain. I did have some lower abdo pain last week, similar to the pain I had prior to my period. Is it worth seeing the doc again or do you think its a sort of period? The thought of going through scans and biopsies again does not appeal! Any advice appreciated."

Zigangie,2016-02-07T05:22+00:00,3 months on HRT,"So in 4 days time I will have been on oestrogel and Utrogestan for 3 months. A lot has changed for me. Serious depression for around 10 long years lifting at last. I have said this on here before best Christmas in 10 years and actually looking forward to many more. Horrible anxiety. Now I didn't have a word for this and just kept telling everyone I felt ready to do something, I often felt I just wanted to leave I don't know where I thought I was going to go. But as it began to go I realised I had had this awful tension in my body for ages. My husband had been aware of it in a way for a few years as he was always telling me to relax because he said my shoulders were pulled up. Less than a week into HRT I suddenly kept finding myself feeling very laid back. About 6 weeks in I had a re emergence of some symptoms that had improved a lot on their own. Feeling sick and yuk and a horrible taste also going to the loo a lot and getting sudden I need to go right now urges and the thirst returned with a vengeance. These had settled back down by 8 weeks in. I didn't say earlier because I thought it was wishful thinking but my hair top lip and lower arm hair seem to be coming back. I've had to pluck a few stray eyebrow hairs and I haven't had to do that for ? 7 maybe years. I had to buy some new tweezers. I feel like a woman again instead of a thing (that could be to do with having periods again though). I have found myself saying a long list of stuff and not um um all the time. I have forgotten my shopping list twice, as I would have done pre peri I just went back over what I had written and came back with everything I needed once and forgot one not so important thing the second time. Also with the memory I have that few seconds of horror knowing I have forgotten a word but instead of floundering about and resorting to my usual ""the yellow thing"" after a pause and a deep breath the word is there. This was the way it began early peri, then I used to think it was because I panicked that I'd forgotten the word but it got worse and worse until just before I began the HRT I would give up because it seemed my head was just a big empty space. Anyway going for a wee it had become on occasions a very weak steam which would sort of dribble everywhere that has gone back to my normal jet and I seem to be able to wait longer and therefore do more when I do go. I really think my breasts are a bit perkier, I haven't lost any weight so they should be the same but my nipples don't seem to be pointing at the floor quite as badly. Some aches and pains have gone some haven't and my left shoulder seems actually to be getting worse. I sometimes feel really cold I know that doesn't sound very exciting but it is for me as I've always been the ice queen and my husband has to fight me off from warming myself on him when I get in bed instead of shooing him away because I'm too hot. I have only had a very few nights when I have had to put an arm out to cool down but that's better than my whole body in and out every 10 minutes. We have become cuddly again have had sex almost every night so we have regained a closeness that had all but disappeared. Sex is OK much more comfortable, although he still has a teenage libido he takes longer these days which is nice now but was awful because I was getting so sore after a few minutes and no amount of lubrication alerted that fact. Orgasms I can get most of the time they are not as strong as they used to be and take a lot longer to get. They had become non existent even with a vibrator. I do use testosterone no one will prescribe it so I just buy it, also tribulus tetris (I read some report that women who take it alongside testosterone reported more frequent and satisfying sexual encounters than those on testosterone alone). Enjoying sex seems to have helped regain some confidence like I said feel like a woman again. Sleep is still the bane of my life, the first 8 nights on the estrogen I slept perfectly as I had pre peri, no thirst no toilet trips just a refreshing 8 hours, unfortunately it was short lived and I'm back to either laying wide awake (but at least not hot and uncomfortable) or I get to sleep with some difficulty and then wake at 3 and cannot get back to sleep. I will see if I can try a higher dose of estrogen to see if that helps but I'm still hoping that as it was the first problem I had maybe it will resolve in time. I'm a lot of the time like I was in early peri. I get a sick feeling or little up tightness a bad taste or spaced out feeling bit of a heart flutter but it's soon over. The taste used to drive me crazy all day every day and heart palpitations for ages. I'm not sure about fatigue and my constipation is still there and still a bit thirsty on and off. I used to always be thinking to myself oh I feel so yuk/horrible/sick. now I've had a few times when the thought is oh I feel so normal. HRT gets my vote. I didn't want to succumb to it but in desperation decided to try for 3 to 6 months. I'm going to take this as long as I can! Hoping this helps some of you who are considering giving it a go."

BugglyBot,2016-02-09T16:26+00:00,Hope Someone Knows What I Mean,"I stopped having painful boobs for several years but last year, they started up again before a period. Now they feel so sore, similar to when I'd start off with breastfeeding. If anyone catches them, I could swear and curse, (actually I do to myself). The pain subsides and then within a couple of weeks, it's back. It's just starting up again this week. I'm also getting this unbelievable tiredness. My eyes feel dry and it's really worrying me. Sometimes I get what I can only describe as a vague period pain on and off, sometimes feel sick and......the list goes on. I have the Mirena coil fitted and it has been wonderful because it stopped the excessive bleeding I used to have. I couldn't go on with that so it was either the coil or a Hysterectomy. The snag, is that I get the PMS symptoms but either don't bleed at all or barely lose anything. Weird as it sounds, when you bleed, you can time things better. Me being me, I panic and think the worst. Nothing is innocent anymore, not even an ache in my finger as I think it has to be something frightening. My anxiety is terrible right now, I freak out at the thought of going to the doctor's. I'm due my Diabetes check and I am struggling to make that phone call. I know that I don't have to ring here and now but it's not right that I feel this way. I feel very alone, even though I know so many ladies suffer the same. I try to rationalise things and tell myself to stop with the worrying but it doesn't work. Your posts here help me to no end, thank goodness this forum is here."

I've had it before but everytime I get it, it gets me down and makes my anxiety soar. For months my poor bowels have been upset. I've had mainly constipation, almost as if my digestion has gone on holiday and everything's slowed down. My piles are having a great time so I take Macrogol when needed. I can't tell though if it's a period pain, (given how upside down my cycle is), or if it's more of a wind problem. It feels more period related though but it's hard to tell. Has anyone else had this or know what I'm talking about?"
jamie50513,2016-02-11T20:46+00:00,Anyone Else?,"I feel horrible today. I keep getting a chill that sweeps over me, then I feel really hot like I have a fever and my tummy feels a little upset. Feels like I could be coming down with the flu or something. It's disturbing. Has anyone else expierenced this?"
lennie45832,2016-02-11T20:55+00:00,Dr. Visit,"Hello everyone, finally went to the N.P she tallied up the symptoms as peri but she is going to run test on the thyroid, we discussed some of the menopausal issues but we focused more on my diabetes issues, She also said we will discuss the peri issues when I go back, essentially she said as far as the peri issues, its all apart of the syndrome, and unless I choose HRTS which she is willing to prescribe, its only homeopathic solutions. She did not think I had arthritis or R.A, just tendonitis aggravated by menopause. She did say menopause aggravates diabetes. So, I am getting A-1C check also when we do all the labs. We discussed my anxiety, so tomorrow I am seeing a therapist about my fears of medical treatment and medical testing. As she said, you have to get these tests done and you cannot live in fear and dread and refuse to get yourself checked out because of dread and fear. I have gained more weight which totally sucks and I guess that will be addressed next visit too, in the mean time I have decided to start calorie counting. I hate how I get ravenously hungry this plays a big role in the weight gain, since my knee injury I have not been able to walk. Anyway, I do feel better since the visit, of course more anxietyabout the test next week and next month the colonoscopy which she recommends too."
jamie50513,2016-02-09T11:26+00:00,Anxiety and Menopause!!!,"Hello Ladies, I know there are several posts on anxiety and peri/meno and a forum just for anxiety. But I had to get to the bottom of this especially when I am told conflicting information. I know that anxiety can come from a traumatic situations in your life but I have had several and never had a issue with anxiety so I couldn't figure out why so much now. I was told that anxiety was not a part of peri. Well I did some research ( in which I vowed to never do again because it scares the heck out of me) and low and behold, anxiety was one of the main symptoms. I find myself waking up nervous, I get nervous just driving a distance which I never was at first. I used to love to drive, now I can't do it alone. I find myself just sitting and all of a sudden I get nervous. Since I have started with these symptoms, my anxiety is through the roof. I have addressed it with my GP who doesn't get it and just gave me a script for Ativan. I am going to try it because I really do need to relax a little. What I want to know is does this anxiety stay with you during the duration of the change? Or does it get better?"
helen95781,2016-02-05T13:42+00:00,Gastric problems.,Hi all. It's been a while since I posted on here but I have been keeping up on all posts. I was wondering if anyone else has to take Omeprazole for acid. I have been on it now for a while (20mg). How do you feel when on it. Do you have any side effects. My doctor wants to increase my dose to 40mg but I'm very reluctant to. The doctor has suggested an endoscopy which terrifies me. I worry that I've got an ulcer ( I'm sure unnecessarily!!) but it has set my health anxiety off. This peri sure is hard going. Any thoughts? Thanks all. Helen.
sharcerv52408,2016-02-11T00:09+00:00,So tired of this crazy ride!,Hi Ladies! Just need to vent! I was finally starting to get a break today with the heatburn I had been having for the past several days and then all of a sudden I got this weird feeling in my stomach which migrated to my chest. Of course this sent me into a panic and I was left feeling weird off and on all day long. I kept checking my bp and pulse to make sure it wasn't my heart. My legs had that weak wobbly feeling and I felt tired and strange all over. I will be so glad when all of this is over! It does not follow any discernible pattern of behavior at all!

Weird dreams.  Crazy, acid trip dreams.  From the minute I close my eyes, 'til I wake up in the morning, dreams.  Not bad or scary, but definitely wierd and some are creepy.  I am waking up several times a night and wondering what the hell that last one was all about, only to segue right into another.  No new meds, nothing has changed..just all of a sudden with the crazy dreams, all night, every night.  Even if I try to nap during the day...it happens.  Please tell me this happens to someone else so I know it's not a brain tumor or something else that I will Google and scare myself with.  xx"

Sochima822,2016-02-07T12:12+00:00,Body Odor Helpppp,"Okay, I've been dealing with under arm body odor, and the smell is nasty to me. I've tried all types of organic deodorants, the ones with aluminum give me breast pain, so I try to avoid them, but use them only in emergencies. I shower daily, but sometimes when I'm out shopping or at work I have to wash my under arms to get rid of the smell. Baking soda makes me stink more., vinegar is not for everyday. Is anyone dealing with this yet? I know the ph of our bodies change during this phase but this is too stinky! Any suggestions to this awful smell?"
sharcerv52408,2016-02-06T18:04+00:00,Not my mother's menopause,"Just like everything else in this world has gone through some kind of ""evolution,"" I think menopause has as well. I can't imagine our mothers and grandmothers having gone through menopause to the extent and measure that some of us are going through it or else I'm sure we would have heard about it. I mean think about it, back in their day we lived in a more holistic culture. A culture that cared for and nurtured people with natural cures rather than medicine. Doctors used more natural approaches to healing. The only symptoms our foremothers had to complain about were the heat flashes and weepiness. That is probably the most complaint they had which is why that is all the doctors are familiar with and therefore all their medical textbooks refer to. Now here we are in this day and age with a litany of symptoms that doctors are unfamiliar with which has them thinking we are crazy. They are going by old textbook information. There has been a great change in the way menopause behaves. But what has caused this great paradigm shift in our symptoms? I think it has a great deal to do with the pollutants we're exposed to today, the chemical process our foods are manufactured with and even the medications a lot of us are on and if you factor in any other stresses in our lives then it's no wonder we are going through it so rough. I honestly believe if my mother or any of our foremothers we're going through it like this, we would've heard about it. This is definitely not our mothers' menopause."
AusWinnie,2016-02-08T22:11+00:00,HRT for over 60s,"Well, after about 5 years of putting up with feeling like a 90 year old I have finally given in and gone back on to HRT.  I am 61 and at age 50 started to feel joint pain and stiffness which has progressivly worstened since then.  I have tried everything.  Natural remedies, supplements, chiropractors, physios, oesteos, you name it.  Nothing worked and I just kept getting worse.  Yesterday I went to a new doctor and told her I was just tired.  Tired of feeling like this and tired of not being able to do things my 75 year old partner can easily do.  To make things worse, for the past few years I have gradually been getting vaginal atrophy which is now at the point where I can't be with my partner.  I really wanted to be able to manage all this without HRT but my quality of life is just rubbish.  The doctor gave me a medication called Kliogest.  I am feeling better already just knowing I have done something about all this that might make me feel like I used to.  I can't wait for it to kick in and really hope I will feel better.  My question is, has anyone else started HRT at over 60?  Did it work?  How are you feeling?  I am a bit nervous about all you hear about cancer etc, but I feel I need to weigh up quality of life.  I don't want to spend every minute of every day in pain if there is a way around it."

Only niggle and do not want to both GP at the minute is that my breasts are so sore and feel swollen.  That was reason it took so long to get HRT as have had a phlebitis and GP said could raise risk of breast cancer, so do not want to go too soon in case she takes me off it.  Is this normal and does it go away?  I am well endowed and could do without all the soreness and swollen feeling, it is causing me discomfort at night as I do not know what do with them, if you know what I mean."

I'm only 39.. i mean I know my husband is perfectly fine with that but for me it devastates me. I wonder if in peri I could try the FSH test again while on my period and see if it's raised to confirm this? As you know I have no dr to consult so you guys are my advisors here. Im trying to get in with a naturopathic physician here but the costs are exorbitant and huge waiting lists for funding.

Well I've seen yet another Dr & yes another blood test, this time for calcium, vitaminD, insulin & blood sugar which is a Hba1c test...what will this test reveal?!😏 my previous test was all ok, no deficiencies etc so the Dr doubted any supplements would stop this weird woozy unbalanced feeling & put it down to just hormones that are probably still fluctuating/cycling which can happen for some time post meno OMG! not easy living with this horrid scary crap & to have the sickly hungry low blood sugar feeling on top...aye, the fun!

I eat & eat which then slowly makes that sensation subside. Have read that low estrogen can effect blood sugar levels & progesterone can help to balance it...i think, is the Livial having an adverse reaction making me sick, should I try another type of HRT, should I try multivitamins/b12, as I really don't have a life at the moment. When I've mentioned this to Drs they say take ADs...I feel I'm not being heard or they have no idea what I mean 😥 I'm seeing yet another Dr soon & will ask about my hormone levels, the Livial & blood sugars etc Lets hope I get somewhere, I can't go on living with this, it restrict everything I do....I used to be a get up n do n go out person but now every day as to what I do or don't do hinges on how I feel.

I am a single mum of 51 and have 2/3 different jobs which can be extremely tiring so sleep is a major issue.  However, I have now started having a period which I was not expecting and quite frankly don't want. It's been 18 months since I last had a period and I'd forgotten how restricting they can be.  Has anyone had the same thing happen to them?  I'm hoping that my body will settle down and the periods will stop  .

Coincidentally, my friends also in this phase have fallen more times than they recall during their lifetime. Yet, leave itto peri/menopause to give us a run for another scratch on thead asking if this related? It seems that tripping and falling, with bad beady eyesight and forgetful fog brain on the loose, we're liable to injure ourselves unknowingly and thinking that it may not be related to one of the many symptoms of this dreadful pathetic time in our lives. Well, ladies I believe it is a symptom not yet listed. looks like I broke my nose, I just hope the swelling goes down."

Beetle1965,2016-02-02T22:49+00:00,"Feeling very alone, fed up......... started night sweats and have fibroids","Click here to view image I am nearly 46 and it has been two years since I started feeling not myself.  I went back and forth to the Dr with skin issues, swollen ankles, nausea, dizzy etc which were all knew to me. Around the same time I started treatment for emotional trauma and continue to wonder what things are perimenopause and what are anxiety. Today I just feel so tired and alone.  I started night sweats two weeks ago, well not sweating just waking really really hot and I have missed a period and no signs of one coming.  I have an appointment with a gynaecologist this week to talk about multiple fibroids found on a scan in December. I have been through major worry that there is more going on, I have had mid cycle pain, on and off bloating and digestive issues and wonder whether there is a cyst (they could not see on the scan as a fibroid was in the way) I had the scan because I had a couple of periods close together.  All last year my periods were different, gushing blood, not lasting long really and not as regular as before and my GP sent me for the scan just to check but said it was probably perimenopause that could go on for years - previous to that a GP told me my FSH was postmenopausal and I was at risk of osteoparosis and heart disease but the next test for FSH was normal. So, I have just been managing and only went to the GP just to mention the bleeding.  I feel so fed up and the last thing I want is another vague situation with these fibroids or more tests when maybe they are all part of this transition and will reduce as my hormones do (which clearly they are as per my night heat). I guess I have lost confidence in myself and taking care until this all passes and wondering whether I am missing something important with my health - my gut says I am not but really, I feel so vulnerable.  Not one medic has really listened to the whole situation and I feel I have so much changing, with the therapy and my hormones that I just want to crawl under a rock about these fibroids or anything else and just ride this out. My GP's havent educated me on the menopause, can't really explain anything and I feel they can only help if I have a structural issue or want HRT, which I would rather avoid.  No counselling how to manage, what symptoms will ride their course and what to be watchful of - I feel in the dark and only forums have helped. But today, I am fed up of it all and just want to hide.  The night heat maybe heralds the end of things or a new phase as the other issues seem to have gone and I was beginning to feel more 'stable'.  Maybe the fibroids are on their way out too. Anyone else want to just ride this out but it feels a bit scary to do so and not jump to the doctors every five minutes or worry incessantly?  I feel so fed up on taking so much energy to manage all this stuff. Thank you for listening"

nancy0925,2016-02-03T14:21+00:00,Low Iron Issues,I just found out that my iron is very low.  Has been gradually dropping since last May and now I have to go to a hematologist for an iron infusion.  I was wondering if any of you ladies found you had iron deficiency going through peri....
stel43725,2016-02-03T16:53+00:00,FYI,"Hi, since I joined this forum I've noticed a lot of women talk about having heart palpitations. I have large fibroids that have caused heavy bleeding, feeling faint and anemia. Anemia means that our iron stores are low due to not producing enough red blood cells, which means that oxygen isn't being carried to our hearts, brains, etc., which causes our hearts to palpitate, foggy brains, fatigue, heart racing, and ultimately makes us anxious, not knowing why these things are happening and imagining the worse. Ladies, please take iron supplements if you are diagnosed with anemia, and if you can't tolerate the pills (they can give you nausea and constipation), there's liquid iron that does not hurt your stomach or cause constipation. I know, because I take it, and now my hematologist tells me that he doesn't even consider me to be anemic since I've taken it faithfully--this after having a blood transfusion and being considered for iron infusions. Thanks for listening, and have a great day."

So I was driving on my way to pick up my sister from work and all of a sudden my head started feeling funny, i started feeling internal tingling, my heart started pounding and I was in full anxiety attack mode. I immediately called 911 because I just knew something was happening to me. I made it to my sister's job and she told me to calm down and not call the ambulance. So I told the 911 operator that I had someone to take me to the hospital. I paced the floor until I calmed myself down. I was wreck on the drive home. Now I'm home and still shaking with some slight dizziness. My family is still trying to get me calm down, but it is easier said than done. I really needed to vent. My family don't understand that I am not a hypochondriac. I really experience physical symptoms. I try to keep the anxiety down as much as possible, but sometimes it gets out of control. I have now retreated to my bed and this is where I will be for the rest of the night. I don't even feel like eating.

jamie50513,2016-02-01T11:41+00:00,Anxiety or Peri/Meno???,"Hello Lovlies, I started having symptoms about 4 months ago of peri. I was having the racing heart, burning feet, inside tremors/tingling, weird head feelings, slight dizziness, off balance, really close together cycles with heavy bleeding and a host of other symptoms. I would get them in spurts. These symptoms started me having bad anxiety. I couldn't figure out what was going on. I followed up with my GP and was given meds for blood pressure, and anemia which was all they could see was wrong. I've had numerous tests and scans and they all come back great which I am happy about. But the symptoms still come and go. I've never had anxiety issues but I do now. I have been trying to keep my stress level down and keep as calm as possible but the anxiety is uncontrollable at times which seem to make the symptoms even more pronounce. After reading up on anxiety, a lot of anxiety symtpoms mimic those of peri also and I believe that is why when I tell my GP how I'm feeling, he says its just anxiety. I'm just wondering if it's really just anxiety that I have, or is this coming from peri? Would like to hear some of you ladies thoughts on this."

daisylady,2016-01-22T20:50+00:00,HRT: Patches or Tablets?,"Hi everyone! I was prescribed Tibolone Tablets a while ago but never took them due to basically being terrified!  I have returned to my GP as the symptoms are getting ridiculous so she is finally doing a TSH among other blood tests.  I am hoping that will show exactly what my hormone levels are, so she can choose the correct HRT.  If I still have to take Tibolone I hope it is available in patches.  If not, do any of you lovely ladies have experience of any other HRT patches?  ( She did initially prescribe me Fem 7 and only because I research everything, I found out they are not suitable for ladies who havent had a hysterectomy, i.e. me!)  Thank you for reading this x"

Have tried citrate in pill form but that went through me...could this popular powder form be just the same? I know you have to start off with tiny quantities but does anyone know if there's a difference between pill or powdered form in its quality? I really need to get more than 4 hours sleep per night!

I dont have to have aheart problem, its just too much to cope with as well as everything else. I was pretty sure I just had a chest infection, but I did get some back pain and felt a bit winded yesterday when cleaning and hoovering.  I dont even know whats normal enymore or not. I just know that I couldnt really cope with bad news. I'd end up paranoid about doing any exercise or aerobic activity or doing anything which might stress me.   I know I'm being stupid. My aunt have had angina for nearly forty years and is 91, so I know people can be Ok with it.  I'm just am active sort of person, and I dont want that to have to stop. I know this isnt directly menopause related, but I have had quite a few health checks in the last year or so, after the menopause set in and I'm fed up with my dr sending me for them!"

Much like many of you, I, too, have had what appears to be a period the past week or so.  I am 54 years old, and my last period was Summer of 2013 (now Jan 2016). Mine began as brown discharge, and has some actual blood in it now, too.  It really feels like a period!  Is that typical of all of these issues you have had as well?  Though it didn't really register at the time, I recall having ovulation-like discharge a couple of weeks ago, preceding the darker discharge. I am under a ton of stress right now, not sure that has anything to do with it..Have an appointment for an ultrasound this coming week.  I have gained a few pounds the past couple of weeks, but not surprised considering the current discharge, etc.  Is this normal?"

I told her I still got weird hot flushy feelings with spacey floaty head but no comment or explanation, I also told her I have a few days feeling a bit better then days that are hell....hot face, get the weird heady wonkies & not feeling well etc but she said nothing about these cycling-like episodes.

When I say I feel like I can't breathe my family tells me so stop panicking because I am breathing. It gets so annoying. Anyone else expierence this? Could it be anxiety playing tricks on me?

Some months I have none but this month is different. I'm dealing with an ovarian cyst on my left ovary, I wonder if that's contributing to it. Indigestion and stomach upset triggers them too.

Since then I have found a wonderful consultant in women's health, have had a mirena coil fitted, am taking anti depressants and started on HRT. I also visit a counsellor regularly. I don't know what the future holds as far coming off HRT etc is concerned all I can tell you is I have my life back. I am back to work having made a lifestyle change and starting to work for myself. I still have my struggles and symptoms still trouble me but I can cope. This morning I actually felt happy for the first time in 12 months.

I have called the paramedics or ran to the ER so many times that I'm scared they won't come when I really need them. I just can't help it. When these crazy feelings come on the anxiety just overwhelms me. The fluttering in my chest, the internal tremors, weird head feelings, the flu feelings, the fluctuating body temperatures is just all overwhelming. Today I just can't seem to shake this nervous and jittery feeling. I ended up turning around to come back home on my way to work.

I went to my OBGYN, had an ultrasound of my bits, bloodwork, all normal with the exception of a ""Heavy uterine lining"".  My period is still coming every 3 to 3.5 weeks, 5 or so days, then gone.  What's killing me is these vague, unending symptoms.  Nausea, lower back pain, migraines (I'm prone anyway), aching upper legs/thighs, general lethargy.  Half the time I'm Googling and scaring myself to death thinking I'm having either a heart attack or have some rare and incurable cancer.  I feel like a flake going to my doctor when I can't really name a single problem, but I'm going to have to.  I feel like crap and all I want my old self back."

youngatheart1,2016-01-06T15:55+00:00,"Going to ask for HRT, is there anything I should be aware of","Hi all, I posted last year about night sweats.  Well enough is enough, I am 56 and started the menopause at around 48.  I have not stopped having flushes during the day and the night sweats are becoming worse.  My GP refused last year to let me have HRT as I had a phlebitis around 30 years ago and she was worried about breast cancer.  I am sure many of you have seen recently that they now think the benefits outweight the worries. I spoke to my sister yesterday who has been on HRT for 3 years and highly recommends it and lo and behold I found out she had had a DVT 26 years ago (not much of a sister am I not knowing that) so that is my stance when I go next week.  My night sweats are horrendous, I wake every couple of hours because of being soaked and them end up going to to loo LOL so sleep is broken nightly.  Yesterday walking home at lunchtime I bumped into my neighbour and whilst talking a flush came over me and my glassed steamed up, she looked at me a bit strangely, which was rather embarrasing, So now what happens, do I need blood test, do I start on a low dose and increase and will it stop these rotten aches and pains that I have had since all this started.  Any advise greatly received."

jane9876,2016-01-17T19:32+00:00,Lower back pain,Hi I just wondered if anybody in their first few months of Peri menapause have had any joint pains in their lower back and knuckles. I wake up sometimes with it or if I am shopping for long periods of time it comes on. It is not painful just very stiff and annoying. I saw my GP who put me on HRT which really has improved so many symptoms and very happy with it except for bloating which I hope just settled down over next few months. The GP said my spine was fine and thinks it is probably just muscular and probably all fits in with peri menapause! Just crazy how us woman have to go through all these horrendous symptoms and have to adapt to them. This time of life for women over 50 we know have to go through all this but why is it such a taboo subject and shouldn't be!!!! Some women are even younger than 50 going through this which is totally unfair!

I was just wondering, since there are probably millions of us out there going through this process how anew get the doctors to see that these symptoms are for real and that this is real medical case? If we have all of these symptoms in common and many others and we're all expressing this to our doctors then why can't they see that we need help in this area? All they want to do is give us AD's or BC. A lot of us at this time in our lives are sensitive to the side effects of these medicines and they cause more problems than what we already have. When are the medical professionals going to wake up and take notice of what we are saying? We need help in other ways besides medicine. Sometimes just a little reassurance that we are not alone and offer more therapeutic ways of coping with all of this."

Anyway, I learned today via google that could be a gallbladder issue, Great, another freaking thing that could be wrong with me. Needless to say, I am freaking out over that, but I keep thinking why did it show up exactly when peri started, I am of course once again going to address this when I go to the dr. I feel like I need a doctor in my home Seriously....... I noticed via google that all the symptoms except hot flashes could also be something else more seroius or chronic.

Some symptoms we may not have any relief from, therefore if someone who reads this has an idea how to gain relief they can share. So I'll start: 1. Palpitations - no remedy. Worse during/around ovulation and period. Also worse if I drink wine (sadly!! Lol) 2. Dizziness - I take vitamin B12 boost spray and a good quality women's vitamin, still suffer around ovulation and periods but the edge has definitely been taken off. 3. Sore breasts - no remedy 4. Brain fog - see above for B12 and multi vitamins 5. Absolutely no desire for sex during 2nd phase of my cycle, I've no remedy for this and it is causing major relationship problems - any help here would be much appreciated 6. Extremely painful ovulation - I take codeine by the bucketful with hardly any relief any help here appreciated too 7. Extremely heavy and painful periods, again I pop codeine like sweeties with barely any relief. I've tried the mini pill, depo, mirena I just bleed constantly on these methods. 8. Really itchy anus (TMI I know!!!) this is quite troublesome and I've tried every lotion, potion and cream under the rising sun with no luck 9. Fatigue and insomnia - contradiction here don't you think but I spend the day shattered them at night I'm wired, the vitamins have helped with the fatigue a little 10. Achy right knee (strange!!) this only happens before period I also get a pain under my right rib 11. Constant ringing in my ears. Tried stemitil and betahistine - no relief There's a ton more but they're my most troubling symptoms. Any input greatly appreciated by me and maybe others on here. Thanks in advance, Donna xx"

I thought I had a serious illness, I have aches and pains everywhere my bones click ALOT! and i have a headache daily. I can relate to everything I have read here today, and I feel truly relieved to find women in the same boat. on my lunch hour I visited Holland and Barrett and she suggested Sage Extract called Menoforce especially for night sweats and also Evening Primrose Oil with B6. has anyone else tried these, well lets see what happens I think it takes a couple of weeks to see results if youre one of the lucky ones.

Last week, I had horrendous palpitations and they last for over five hours. I went to bed at about 10.00pm and couldn't sleep till well after 2.00am in the morning. I was very down for days and my anxiety was through the roof. I had one episode in bed last night and one this aftenoon and this type of palpitation lasts for about ten to fifteen seconds and my heart feels like it's thumping and trying to get out. My pulse feels weak/different until it passes and then for hours after I'm panicking but trying to keep calm. It doesn't help that I finished a course of two antibiotics last Tuesday morning. Clindamycin and Ciprofloxacin are two of the worst or giving you terrible diarhea and I'm still trying to stop that so again, my anxiety is high this week. I'm now terrified that it's something bad, I'm on constant health alert and down about it so when the palpitations start, I just sit and fret and/or cry.  Does anyone here get palpitations that bad? I've read about many who've had them and it reassures me but when I get them, all logic goes out of the window. Thanks for listening."
amber1620,2016-01-14T08:33+00:00,Unusual Headache symptoms,"Whenever I lie down to go to sleep after about 25 mins I get what feels like a vibrating feeling at the back of my head, it feels like it's happening inside my head as when I rub it it seems to stop and I fall asleep. Sometimes this is accompanied by feelings of pressure in my head but no pain. I have always suffered from migraines and occasional dizzy spells. I have discussed these symptoms with two different doctors and neurologist and no one seems to have any explanation for it. I've also started getting pulsating feeling in temple and wake up with pain that feels like my head is bursting, I'm sure it's menopausal as I'm 52 and it's definitely getting worse. Every visit to doctors leaves me still no wiser as to what's going on....any advise please?"

mandy91562,2016-01-13T14:20+00:00,Hello lovely ladies an update,i love this group so much I've had great comfort and emotional support from all your posts so thank you . i first posted in November with a thickened endometrium. Fast forward a hysteroscopy which showed multiple polyps in December.i also had a biopsy for endometrial cancer which sent me into meltdown on and off over the last few weeks waiting on pins for results. Yesterday I went into hospital ( only I could be booked in on junior doctors strike day) where I had a GA for polyp removal ( around 9 yikes!) and a Mirena coil fitted. I was assured this was to control the horrendous bleeding I had encountered.  I have 1 positive and 1 negative from yesterday: positive ( well BIG positive) my biopsy was clear phew! Last 3 weeks and a ruined Christmas has been a nightmare. But I thank God ( and I mean that) that all is well❤️ The negative: when I came out of the recovery room and for the last 24 hours post op I've had terrible muscle pains in my neck shoulders and arms. Been taking paracetamol and ibuprofen for it. I think it's the meds they use with GA ?  Anyway all all in all I'm ok and hopefully done for now( fingers crossed)  Thank you all much love ❤️❤️❤️

After coming back home from having 2 wks away I've suffered horrible anxiety, why I don't know, always seems to happen & it takes several days for me to settle. I saw my Dr who gave me Effexor but after just 1 low dose tablet I suffered more sickening anxiety, so horrid, scary etc. Mornings can be a trial, feelings of nausea, strange chilly faint sensations & hunger plus IBS like symptoms....didn't have these when I was away.  Is this normal? is it just menopause? Don't know what to do anymore, I'm continuing with Livial(Tibolone) Will all of this ever end? Will I ever feel well again? Has been about 13months since my last period, do things get worse before getting better? am I now stuck with sickening anxietyetc? I'm just miserable 😢 Had another round of blood tests, wonder what the results will reveal. Look after yourselves xo"
mel11237,2016-01-12T18:36+00:00,"Tight achy muscles all the time , with twitching when I relax","I ve had  tight achy muscles since oct 2015, I've also had twitchy muscle when I relax. I'm so tired , really tired . So much so that I don't even want to get out of bed some mornings. I've had panic attacks and dizziness. Docs said its laberythitis , so he gave me stemitil, which he said I had a reaction too, hence the twitching. This is still going on, so it can't be  a side affect still. I'm very moody too. Think I'm in peri menopause as my periods are very erratic. My biggest fear is that it's some sort of cancer of either the brain or bone, as I feel like I've got the flu, all the time,that type of ache. I had breast cancer in 2012, so in remission. Had oncology appt in dec2015 and they were happy with me. I've asked my doc for a blood test to check hormone levels, but he says the hospital won't do them. Ive even offered to pay but he says a waste of money. I'm at a loss of what to do, as I feel rubbish most days, today being a particularly bad one. I found this forum and I could really relate to all of the posts. I turned 50 in nov2015, so am thinking I've got these vit B deficencies. I took menopace for a while but felt worse.

yvonne81394,2016-01-11T18:14+00:00,Question for any meno or postmeno ladies out there.,"This is going to be a bit long but please bear with me.  I have a question to ask to see if anyone else has experienced these symptoms and I appologize in advance for my wordiness.  I'll try to make it as short as possible.  So it begins at what I thought was my last period in May of 2004, age 54.  Normal time frame.  I had no periods after that time until Nov. of 2007, I experienced what felt like PMS symptoms while on vacation.  I even mentioned it laughingly to my husband.  The next morning I woke up bleeding, at 57 after nearly 4 years of nothing.  I put on a pad, which I had to go purchase, and it went on for about five or six days, lightly, but just seemed like a regular period.  I had read somewhere that it is possible to have a ""rogue"" period where an ovary kicks back in for some reason after you believe you're done.  Then I also read that if that happens, you have to start all over again and count that period as the last one and go from there.  Funnily enough after that one, I had a slight bleed/spotting at monthly intervals, sometimes skipping a month or two,  just like a cycle for almost a year after that with pms symptoms before those, the whole thing with the migraine auras, headaches, irritability, lower GI disturbances, etc.  Then it tapered off again and went away.  Now flash back to 1992, at the age of 42, I had an abnormal pap which showed severe dysplasia.  I had had two abnormal paps in my past at a young age, both turned out to be metaplasia.  The doc was mystified as was I.  No risk factors for cc, etc.  After colpo directed biopsies came back, everything was neg so she insisted on doing a LEEP procedure anyway because of the high grade pap finding just to be sure.  Some docs just have you come back in three months for another pap or colpo but she wasn't one of them.  She even thought perhaps my smear got switched with someone elses.  Upon doing that procedure, which will be definitive in it's findings and curative as well, the final diagnosis was a spot of CIN1 and HPV, which she referred to as genital warts.  There wasn't the big tado about HPV back then really.  Studies have found now that this is the type that does not cause cancer but at the time, she offered no number but just said they were the wart kind but ""when they get on your cervix can cause trouble"".  I went on for a few years getting reg paps.  No problem.  I think she was a little too aggressive IMO in this case and I guestioned her ethically due to the fact that I was only able to see her for six months follow up and had to find a new doc as she moved out of state.  I thought perhaps she was trying to pad her pockets before leaving to a new practice by doing a lot of unnecessary stuff on me.  It happens, people.  Anyway, I thought my problem was caused by an the old issue I used to have called ""metaplasia"" which I had told her about and it's cellular structure will mimic dysplasia or cancer cells under a microscope and unless the cytologist is very experienced, might conclude it to be other than the benign condition that it is.  Fast forward back up to present.  So I decided to make an appt. with a new doc after a year of uncertainty and fear about my symptoms and just got an appointment with a gp other than an obgyn.  I hadn't had a smear in a while but because of the occasional funky blood/spot/stain/ etc., and the previous medical history with the weird findings, thought it was prudent.  Low and behold, my result came back with an abnormality, an AGC, atypical glandular cells.  The doc didn't seem that concerned with it.  In fact, I got the report from the lab and called her first and she said I ought to just go to a gyn and get a colpo to make sure it wasn't anything.  Well I was a bit freaked out!  But that's not the worst of it.  I have a tendancy to self diagnose and I worked in medicine for over 30 years and know quite a bit and have read tons and self educated on gynecological disorders and diseases but not as an educated pro, of course.  But it didn't add up to me still.  That pap result can be anything from nothing at all, to benign conditions to cancer, even in some distant organ other than the reproductive which made it a tad scarey.   However, I also have a retrodisplaced uterus or ""tipped womb"".  I do know that due to it's positioning that when a pap is taken, especially a vigorous one with the new cyto brush type, cells from the uterus can accidently be in there because the thing is sitting so low in the pelvis.  You're not suppose to see cells from endometrium in the cervix but you will if the person taking those cells gets too vigorous with the brush, and she ground around down there like she was boring for ore, coupled with a uterus that sits too low in there.  These cells then will be observed as ""atypical"" by the lab and kicked back for further evaluation.  I also know I have a friable cervix because I almost bled out during my LEEP, which scared the hell out of me, and it can bleed on touch even after a pap, especially now since I had the LEEP.  I remember that doc who did the LEEP procedure warning me of that.  ""You'll probably bleed now when you have paps and have funky periods from now on.""  those were her words.   No wonder she moves around so much.  Geez!    So my thinking was, and dangerously I admit, that it was much todo about nothing again.  So I watched my symptoms and made daily clinical notes on a log and decided not to follow through with my symptoms or the past abnormal smear but to just watch it and see if it worsened or changed.  I also recalled my mother's experience in her early fifties.  I remember her going to her gp because, ""My period started again.""  And trust me, my Mom did not discuss her gynecological issues with anyone!  She was given a D and C and was told it was old fibroids.  I guess when they start breaking down as the estrogen depleats, they can bleed which would explain the ""old blood"" look to the discharge. I can report that as of this past Sept. the bleeding and rather odd watery discharge I was having for so many years just finally stopped.  It seemed to taper off after an expulsion earlier last year of dark clotty stuff.  Not a lot but weird, and lengthen out between episodes and this is the longest I've gone without any symptoms whatsoever.  Guess that might have bee the last hoorah on it.  I have read that an atrophic vagina and uterus can cause these symptoms too and so can the hormonal swings and imbalances during this time and fibroid death, polyps and so can cancer.  I took the chance since it seemed like going through the angst of a colpo again, findings probably being neg again and having some very expensive and painful tests all over again was very distressing to me. VERY!  It's like that , ""Oh no, not again.  No more please!"" feeling.  And worst part was when my AGC pap came back that one time, they did not do a test for HPV like they were suppose to.  The reason they did not stated on the lab report was, ""No HPV test was done due to pap findings.""  What the hell did that mean?  Anyway, I took my chances and knowing the sequence of events in any progressing cancer, signs and symptoms, I kept vigilant.  Mind you, the AGC pap test have just recently been upgraded from a ""wait and see"" approach to a more agressive one even though only half of them are anything and the half nothing.  And of the half that could be something, 80% of those are benign conditions and a small percentage then will turn out to be of a more serious nature, a precancer or an invasive cancer.  Seems like a low percentage to me in order to frighten the crap out of women in to more testing and procedures she may not need.   So over the followng months and years, from Sept of 2009 to now, I've had an on again, off again, spotting anywhere from a dark blood to blackish, barely pink streaks to red blood, tiny clots on tissue but oddly enough, never ever had anything show up on my underwear.  This year it tapered off until Sept when what little pinkish smear or speck on tp finally disappeared altogether and has not returned.  I do believe my own self diagnosis was the correct one, fortunately, and I luckily spared myself of a lot of expensive tests, pain and exploratory investigations, which is popular in this country, and all I probably was experiencing was hormonal changes due to the menopause and some atrophy of the vaginal tissues.  Cancer is a very rare disease still and most are slow growing and progressive.  I just probably dodged a big bullet that may not have been coming at me anyway.  All through this entire thing there has been no pain whatsoever in the abdomen, back or legs, malodorous discharge, which is characteristic of most gyno cancers, no increase in blood or discharge.    So, what do you think?  Anyone else experienced this or had the same tests results but unlike me, went ahead with all the rigors of investigative medicine only to find nothing wrong?  Or took the chance and did what I did and the end result was same as mine or similar?  Or some other issue was the result.  All comments are welcome.  I don't condone anyone doing what I did.  It is risky but I felt I did know enough about my body and my medical and family history and risk factors to take the chance.  So like they say, don't try this at home, kids.  And results may vary. I welcome your responses and appologize for the novel.  .  Click here to view image"

The instructions on the pack were to take for a maximum of 10 days at a time. She started them today whilst already bleeding; we are very confused as to what happens after 10 days. She has to stop taking it and presumably then will resume bleeding as this may well be caused by the mini-pill she is on (the name of which escapes me). How long does she have to wait before taking Norethisterone again?  Any advice would be a great help.

This makes my anxiety bad also. I also have developed redness and dry skin at the sides of my nose and my chin which I can't get to clear up. Some days I'm so tired not like I've run a marathon but weak like I can't even lift an arm I do get up an about but it's exhausting like a wide awake zombie. I also feel dizzy but not like I've spun in circles like swimmy feeling. If I drink alcohol the next day it's 1000 X worse all the symptoms horrendous weird head. My periods come Every 32 to 26 days and last 3 days is this normal ? This all started a year and a half ago I have good weeks and bad. This is a bad one I'm on my period at the moment and feel horrendous I've been Drs allot I'm young with a family history of early menopause but the Drs say to young but no one can tell me what's wrong and this isn't how a 'normal' person feels ! Is anyone else experiencing any of the above and anything to help looking to find out that this is similar to other people as at times just can't believe I'm meant to just stay feeling like this at times I'm sure I'm dying 😰 Thank you x"

BugglyBot,2016-01-04T15:00+00:00,Feel So Low And Frightened,"Hi everyone. I've been reading this forum for a while now and all I can say is, thank you for sharing x. I just turned 50 in November and I am a wreck. I've had some of the worst palpitations I've ever had and my heart has raced. Last night, I couldn't sleep for hours because of it. My anxiety is through the roof and I just want to sit and cry in desperation. I have been out of it over Christmas and that has really upset me. Christmas day and Boxing day were a nightmare for me. Our dogs had a fight and while separating them, I got bitten on the leg and ended up having to have a tetanus and antibiotics..these have given me horrendous diarhea and thrush on top of how I feel. I have been breathless, heavy legged and restless legs, dizzy, tired and spaced out and the palpitations and racing has really gotten me down. I'm constantly terrified that something bad is wrong with me. I had my usual pre-period symptoms only they're intensified. I have the Mirena coil fitted as I had very heavy periods and needed that sorting so the bleeding is mostly small and intermittent, (however I go into overdrive constantly wondering it's something terrible and not just a period). I've also noticed that any stress or upset now makes me feel worse but that is hard to avoid when how I feel causes it. I am so down. The doctor a few weeks ago, gave me beta blockers but I haven't taken any as she said it can aggravate my asthma and my breathing's been awkward enough and after my sister's experience and reading here, it isn't something I dare take if it makes me worse. I can no longer tolerate caffeine, it's been that way for a few years now but if I dare just one cup of just tea, (let alone coffee), I start with the panic attack feelings within minutes. I'm wondering what other foods are doing similar things to me now. I have so many symptoms of perimenopause that it astounds me how anyone can function while suffering this. I have the most amazing husband. Bless him, he's disabled, he can't walk properly and his hands aren't brilliant and yet he sees me in tears and frightened and just supports me. I felt so guilty as he and my boys shouldn't be seeing me like this. I've just spent a morning in bed because of the palpitations, etc, last night, and yet hubby just takes it all in his stride. He's amazing.  I hope you don't mind me posting, I just wanted to get vent a little among women who know how I feel. Your posts have lifted me up and made me feel sane. I just wish that when I get a symptom, like the palpitations that I could take comfort in knowing I'm not on my own. Unfortunately though, my fear doesn't lessen. I feel so pathetic and desperate just to feel good again. Thanks for listening."

HopeAgain,2015-12-26T02:04+00:00,Does No Hormones = No Femininity?,"I have never understood something. I am in perimenopause at the moment. After menopause when your ovaries stop producing hormones and your body is making a lot less than before do you feel better? I get scared of all of this because I think NO HORMONES = No Femininity.  Do you begin to gain back your libido or do you always lose it? Does your voice deepen?  What is it like when your hormones are all gone? How can your body stay feminine when there are no female hormones? Seriously, this frightens me. I've seen older women who look feminine but do they all take hormone replacement?"

I've had no periods for about thirteen months, so I guess I'm just new at entering menopause & it'll be a while for all this to settle.

Beetle1965,2015-12-21T19:13+00:00,Unanswered questions on erractic bleeding causing me worry,"Hello - so far this year I have been told my FSH levels were showing post menopausal and then normal.  I have had changes in my cycle regularity from a steady 25/26/27 to a run of regular, then sort 17/18/19 days to 37/38 days.  Along with that has been a change in the way they happen, sometimes a good few days of spotting before hand, sometimes pink or brown then a day or two of heavy flow (although it's mainly when I go to the toilet) and then it stops abruptly or spots for a good 5 days. This pattern of bleeding emerged in January along with severe pain in my back and ovary area that subsided - the Dr took my blood tests and said perimenopause and i put it down to that.  Since then I went to the GP again to say I was a bit concerned about this gushy bleeding, advised this is a common perimenopause thing but will have an ultrasound to check for polyps or fibroids adding to the bleeding. I had the ultrasound last week which found multiple fibroids but actually no further info on whether this is causing the odd bleeding, they could only see fibroids on the outside of the uterus and I might need an MRI to check the inside.  They couldn't see my ovaries or lining. My issue is this - I am now worried about the treatment suggested for the fibroids (surgery is my fear) but am managing this anxiety and will wait for the gynae referral appointment which could be 6-8 weeks I am told. The main thing that keeps bugging me is the strange bleeding, from what I read fibroids if they cause bleeding problems it is heavy flow for quite some time.  I don't think this is what I am experiencing, it's just different in 'quality' and not thick anymore.  My concern is  this is caused by some sort of problem noone has mentioned, a thick lining (I've heard this happens if estrogen is high) or something wrong with ovaries. In January nobody continued investigating so I just put it down to the hormones, but now I am worried it's something sinister they should have followed up. I am sure noone can help me here and that the gynae will hopefully explain to me whether this bleeding is just par for the course in perimenopause and the fibroids are something to deal with but generally there is nothing untoward.  Of course I cannot hear that right now and as my periods has arrived 'early' again it has set me off. I am under the impression the gynae appointment is to suggest ways to treat the fibroids and perhaps take more scans. I am so in the dark about what things I should consider abnormal or just part of changes.  My periods have always started a bit light, heavier and then tail off - 5 days of manageble bleeding.  Now it is almost like a faucet goes on and off and that's it.  Not excessive but not my 'normal' - I get more of a heavy feeling and dragging before my periods than before, that could be the fibroids and a general feeling of yuck but that's it. Can someone offer me any reassurance?  I am 45 and wondering what is going on, maybe it's not perimenopause after all aaaargggh It's enough to drive you potty x"

About a week ago I had such bad heartburn that it sent me into one of the worst anxiety fits to date. Then yesterday I was on my way to church and had to turn around and go back home because I started having a panic attack. All I could do was crawl into bed and stay there. It was so depressing and frustrating. I want to wake up from this nightmare!"
BellaLuna,2015-12-14T00:27+00:00,Could this be perimenopause?,"I am 38 and for at least a year I have had periods that start with days of spotting almost to the point where I will think it's never going to start properly but then it does, at first it wasn't every month, it was most months though. They were always still my usual 4 weeks apart though until about 6-8 months ago when I started to get them every 3 weeks instead and the days of spotting before my normal flow are every single month now. I do have an anxiety disorder but in recent weeks the anxiety has been absolutely off the scale, I can honestly say I have never had it so bad, I have also noticed hair growth on my chin, I have to pluck them out because they are very prominent and I am convinced my hair is thinner at the front parting, I certainly shed much more than usual when brushing and washing. No night sweats but lots of hot flushes and generally feeling too warm, even on a cold night I can seldom have a cover on me and sometimes I go very cold after that hot flush. I am having a blood test for my thyroid this week after consulting my GP but it didn't occur to me at the time I saw her to mention my cycles, I only considered the start of menopause after searching google about the change in my cycles and seeing so many results linking it to that. I will mention it when I see her for my blood test results but I don't even know if there is a reliable way to test for perimenopause, it's all very new to me. So really I am just looking for opinions on whether or not it's a viable possibility, I'm quite scared to be honest especially after reading that the whole process and symptoms can last for many years. Could this be the start? Many thanks."

Beetle1965,2015-12-13T15:36+00:00,"Scan Anxiety - wonky periods, ultrasound fear","Hi - I am 45 and in January of this year I had a period that spotted at the end for over a week, hormone testing showed menopause, blood test six weeks later showed normal FSH levels.  So deduced the spotting was perimenopause.  I have had regular periods all year but they are different, sometimes heavy, sometimes spotting a lot before or after.  They just don't 'flow' the same. Cycle lengths also vary, from my previous normal of 25/26 to 21, 37, 24, 25 and a couple that were only 17/18 days apart.  After the last short gap and a heavier flow, I got a bit worried and went to the GP to tell her, she said it is typical of perimenopause to see this pattern but also useful to check there aren't any structural reasons for irregular bleeding and to have a transvaginal ultrasound. I have this coming up this week. I was fine about it until today and now I am a nervous wreck, worried out of my mind what they will find and just feel so vulnerable about the scan itself. I am no good at gynae things, I have not had children and the whole thing brings up feelings of naievity and a sense 'there is something wrong with me'.  I know this is irrational because at the end of the day the Dr is just checking that perimenopause hormonal stuff is the cause and I should be relieved if it is and that will help but...........I can't stop worrying. I have only had a transvaginal exam once, about 15 years ago, it wasn't pleasant, only because I was scared when the personal scanning told me she couldn't find an ovary, then she did, that they were healthy but I had a mass on my uterus which was a fibroid.  At the time I didn't know what that was all about and she wouldn't tell me - the DR then explained a week later that it was on the outside and nothing to worry about.  I have also had two burst ovarian cysts in my life and a cervical polyp which was removed a couple of years ago. Basically anything unknown scares me and language and procedures that I feel I should understand, but I don't.  I have been reading about the higher chance of uterine cancer, ovarian cancer etc after mid 40's and scared myself wondering if the bleeding can be any of these and imagining that the scan will reveal 'bad' news and what will come next.  Basically I feel out of control with all the unknowns and am sure I am over anxious as the majority of scans don't reveal serious things. The Dr mentioned the possibility of uterine polyps or fibroids, the first might need removing and the second they would leave as they tend to shrink after menopause. Seriously, I need some logical thoughts to hold onto here, I am just terrified of bad news and the person saying or looking a certain way during the scan and either saying something or me thinking the worst etc. I have had several traumatic events in my life where I thought all was well and it turned out not to be - not with me, but my family and realise that this has left a mark on me, thinking that this is generally what happens.  Bad news comes out of the blue when you think all is well and 'normal'. Honestly the thought of the whole thing feels so alien to me, I am ready to avoid doing it - which I won't.  Can someone share with me how routine this is and perhaps if my bleeding pattern is anything to worry about because I really didn't think it was. It is still sort of cyclical but definately different. Click here to view image"

I knew sweats were a symptom but omg this is beyond belief, they arent night sweats, they come all the time, if I leave the house (which isnt often) I take a kitchen roll with me to mop up whatever I can, it starts on my head, runs down my brow and face, my neck and then the rest of body breaks out and whatever I am wearing just sticks to me.  At home I have a fan on all the time, a night a fan on all the time, I have even had the portable air conditioner on at home too to help but its rare anything does. I bath daily, several times infact, I am paranoid of smelling bad, my hair sticks to me and drips also. Can anyone suggest any help with this please, I know nothing about any hormones etc and I think if I go to the doctors again with yet another condition they may lock me up as a lost cause.

sharcerv52408,2015-12-11T12:25+00:00,Crazy anxiety,"Hi all! For the past week or so I have been getting anxiety attacks galore! Back in November my GYN put me on bc pills to balance my hormones. I had back pain, flu symptoms, nausea, fatigue, spotting, weird sensations in my head, and last but not least, crazy anxiety. One day I had bad heartburn which sent me into panic mode so I ended up in the ER. They did an EKG and all was ok. But every night I still feel extremely anxious and I get these attacks. I didn't used to get anxiety like this before taking these bc pills. I stopped taking them. Now I'm on my period for how long, is anyone's guess."

Everything negative. The most I have is a little gastritis, but I have no pain. I almost feel like I have a weird disease or something wrong with my cortisol levels. Maybe a tumor on whatever affects all that. Some people call me lucky and I look good. I see nothing but I look odd now. I am about 206 but used to be 217 last year. Been struggling to get my weight bac, when most people say including my Dr. That I need to lose more weight. Trust me I'm not trying to lose this wright. I think it happens in my sleep. I take vitamin b12 and D and s probiotic to control my IBS I get sometimes. Just crazy.. That is my only worry. Is to get my weight back. Never thought I'd want my weight back but I do. How or why did my body change so drastically. How do I get it back. I eat everything fatty and high cal. Hungry often too. Almost like I have a parasite, but was already checked for that too. Nada... Wish someone would tell me they have or had the same problems too. Maybe its not menopause. I just don't know anymore. I'm 50 years old and hate this already. So what's so great about getting older.

My husband has always had a high sex drive and i was always on the other end of the scale. I am 51 and he is 50. He has been through alot of life changes, his job which he was in for years ended ( redundancy) and he met his real birth mother after nearly fifty years. This in itself caused a few problems as she only wanted to know him and not his family, so i have felt a bit left out. He isn't as bad as he was with her (totally obsessed with the idea of meeting her ( which i could understand to an extent). He isn't particularly happy in his new job and i feel this doesn't help. He complains of always feeling tired and has gained abit of weight (although being tall he carries it off) I'm feeling abit unloved as the closeness has gone due to lack of sexual closeness, when i confront him he just says perhaps he is going through a sort of change. He doesn't understand it isnt about the sex, it is more about feeling loved. This menopause bussiness doesn't help me as i feel depressed myself, i also have the empty nest syndrome and feel in limbo. I'm certain there isnt anyone else, i just wondered am i the only one whose husband has lost all interest??"

Im still waiting to have one after my last one which was 70 days ago. Im so fed up of the sore breasts and feeling like im going to have one but it never comes. Im not sleeping well either! Ive tried several antidepressants due to anxiety. I just never feel right and these hot flushes make me feel awful! I ache all the time.... Just dont know whats wrong with me. The drs are saying to me that im to young to be going through any change..... Feel like im going crazy!
jakimal,2015-11-24T23:30+00:00,Post Menopausal,I'm really struggling to understand if I'm post menopausal! I've not had a period for nearly 12 months. No hot sweats or side affects. I've recently had my FSH levels done which has come back at 146 post menopausal! Really shocked to find out that I've gone through the menopause. Can this be right? Thank you in advance

Beetle1965,2015-11-09T20:53+00:00,Worried about Hyperplasia - overgrown lining,"Hi - I have already posted today with some anxiety about my changing periods that are now irregular and definately different in quality. Since January my periods have not been at the regular 25/26 day intervals.  I have a few that are around that length 24. 27. 22 and then a gap to 39 followed by a short one of 16 days.  Then a few again around 23. 22. 26 and then another long gap 37 and a short one of 17 days.  So I guess there is a pattern there.............sort of The bleeding is horrible, it isn't heavy as such, but it just feels like it's out of control - the periods don't slowly start and peak and peter out as they have all my life.  They arrive and are full on (more watery) and then stop.  It feels as though it is a lot of bleeding but it's more like a sense of evacuation (sorry for TMI) and I get awful water retention and feel like I go down a dress size within a day of starting my period. I am now worrying that these type of bleeds can lead to thickened lining and hyperplasia that needs treating with progesterone.  How do you know if that is happening if the NHS website says irregular bleeding is OK Anyone have any experience with this - I do not like medical procedures and don't want to avoid taking care but also dont want to worry. Aaarrgh I am guessing the only answer is ask the GP - but I am not that comfy with that either (don't know why I am so health anxious right now)"
Kadija1966,2015-11-24T09:16+00:00,Don't know what is wrong with me?,"I feel very weak and tired, my bone aches, I feel nausea and sometimes hungry as well. I don't vomit tho. I feel I want to cry but no tears. My ankles are painful, my chest  painful.  I had dry mouth feeling but now it's stop. I eat well, sleep ok but get panick attacks sometimes were I have difficulty breathing and feel like I'm choking with high heartbeat. Most night I get a feeling like I'm dying in my sleep, it's very scary.....Yesterday I saw my doctor and he says it's stress and anxiety....as lately so much has been happening in my life. Going thru menopause with all sorts of aches and pains.. And now my  partner who gave me a lot of support went to jail for being at the wrong place at the wrong time with friends and he's been arrested and on remand.  I don't have anyone to talk to and I'm only allowed to visit him once a week in jail. My doctor also tells me I have GERD  and put me on omeprazol, for the reflux and stomach pains and gas. It's helping a little but have this lump feeling in my throat as well when I eat. Makes swallowing painful. Oh I don't know what is wrong with me, I,was fine a few weeks ago, I don't drink or smoke and eat healthy. These days I just feel like sleeping as I'm tired most days. Some say it's the menopause and my hormones palying up....anyone having similar issues? I just need some support as I feel so alone in all this.... kadija"

to-ramona,2015-11-22T10:40+00:00,Work Issues,"Hi I'm having some issues at work, some (if not all) to do with this stupid peri menopause business. I'm not sure what to do about it. Not being a naturally positive person, which in the past has caused major low mood crises, I have gradually built myself up and for the past several years I have been the happiest/well adjusted/positive in my life so far. Now that this (peri) has reached its current pitch, I have lost my confidence (and it seems to get lower all the time), my mood is on the floor, I'm anxious much of the time, my energy levels have decreased such that I now spend my weekends and evenings resting/sleeping, I'm covered in aches and pains, my emotional resilience is almost zero meaning I cry at the smallest slight and I have almost nightly (quite dramatic) sweats which cause my sleep to be majorly disrupted. In the words of the Arctic Monkeys, things have all gone a bit Frank Spencer (frankly). Work is really full on at the moment - the nature of what I do can be very fast paced. This of course means that those 'above' me are pressured and totally pre-occupied with getting the job done. My immediate line manager is particularly in the firing line and is someone who takes her work extremely seriously. I'm now having to do some of her job as well as mine, and it's proving to be a problem.  She is short tempered and 'on my back' about how quickly I am working, and the implication is that I'm not as committed as I should be. I know I’m not working as I once did, that's indisputable. Prior to this, we have got on really well and worked together fairly and effectively. In fact, she is the latest manager I have had that I have had a good relationship with, in a long line of good work relationships. I recognise that I have been lucky in this respect. When I say this, I would also add that these have always been 'in-work', and not outside the workplace - I have boundaries that stop at the office door. I'm saying this so that people don't point out to me the potential pitfalls of making friends with your boss - the relationship is entirely appropriate.  I'm now so depressed/anxious all the time – a combination of coping with my myriad symptoms and trying to do a good job and seemingly failing – that I am … Well, feeling extremely grim basically. I often cry as soon as I wake up, and am literally forcing myself to get out of bed, go to work and sound and act positive and ‘on board’ as I can. I then spend portions of the day trying not to cry. A huge regret is that I have been smoking again, having successfully given up nearly 10 years ago. I'm not asking for sympathy for this as it is completely my choice, but what I will say is that I just don't care enough to do anything else. One of the problems is that I lost a job nearly 20 years ago as I was very seriously depressed, which caused me to make mistakes and take quite a lot of time off work (this was unavoidable as I couldn't get out of bed in the mornings, basically). This was probably the lowest time of my life.  I am now drawing unhelpful parallels with this, and am even more anxious as a result. I know that I'm ‘essentially’ OK, i.e. that I'm not back where I was, but these hormonal symptoms almost exactly mimic it. (I know that I’m essentially OK, both on a gut level and also in the fact that I am sometimes able to draw on my philosophical skills to put things in perspective and thus feel better. I had become really good at this, to my great relief and pleasure). I’m on a combination of high dose anti depressants (a ‘cocktail’ that I was put on after all other meds had failed to make an impact, which has served me very well), so a prescription for this kind of medication wouldn't be applicable.  I have made it clear to my GP that I want to try HRT, and have cited my history of depression as an added incentive for this. She Is of the same mind. If it gives me back at least some energy, I will think it worthwhile. In the meantime, I have to find some way of coping at work. Talking to them about it really isn't an option – at least not yet (and hopefully never). Does anyone have any advice, or recommend a book I can look at that would possibly help? Maybe some practical advice. I would also be interested to hear if anyone has a similar experience (not necessarily the depression, but the work problem). I’m already dreading work tomorrow, and am beginning to feel quite sick.  Anyway, thanks for reading and sorry it's such a long ramble. All good things, Anna PS I would also like to say that I still have ‘windows’ of being my old self - it's not unremitting, thank heavens …"

I have not yet noticed any menopause symptoms _ hot flushes etc. But in the last two/three weeks I have noticed my hands tingle a little and very slightly my feet. Has anyone else experienced this?

Shazanne,2015-02-26T03:03+00:00,Help! Taken Off Livial Yesterday!,"Hi. I am really in need of advice. I have been of Livial for (Ithink) almost four years. I moved to Canada almost two years ago and Livial is not approved or available in North America so I have been bring in my tablets from home. Recently I have been feeling pretty low - I suffer depression and anxiety as well - largely due to the complete change in my life and my career. But I have also had two episodes of bloody discharge over the last few months and was also experiencing symptoms similar to PMS and had lower abdominal pain (not severe) and a feeling like a period was about to start. So my doctor referred me to gynaecologist who I saw yesterday. Not only did he know nothing about Livial/Tibolone - he had never even heard of it. I brought the information leaflet along but, while he glanced through it, he didn't really pay much attention. Basically he said that any 'suspicious' bleeding needs to be investigated and he took a biopsy of my uterine lining. Then he told me to stop taking Livial immediately!! He says he wants to see how I will be without it. I asked him what I could expect as a result and his reply that that we'll just have to wait and see!! Needless to say I am concerned about just stopping it overnight and also about what may happen over the next few weeks/months. I am already struggling with low mood and anxiety at the moment and am terrified that this will get worse. I work, so I need to be able to function normally. Basically I am scared. Has anyone else been taken off Livial like this and how did it go for you?"

From tomorrow my patches will change to evorel conti as my consultant thinks I will feel better with these, as I currently still feel very low and weepy. It's as if I think just as I've turned the corner and am feeling more ""myself"", any small, pout of the ordinary event comes along and shakes me to the core. Naturally this makes me feel twice as worried as I'd begun to think I was on the mend. My new patches will cause me to have a bleed once a month......so I'm now worrying about this as I haven't had a period since June 2014. Do any of you ladies out there worry about things like I do......I used to be able to take everything in my stride, but not any more. I can honestly say I HATE this menopause."

ursulauc62,2015-11-17T23:24+00:00,Feeling increasingly bloated,"I have been menopausal for about 8-9 months now, and before that I had lost some weight and found it relatively easy to keep it off as long as I ate healthily.  In the last few months I have been getting increasingly bloated and saggy around my abdomen, even though my diet has become very strict, and I have tried so much to lose weight. I eat considerably less than the recommended calories for women each day, and eat hardly any fat or meat or sweet foods or choclate. It seems to make no difference. I have been tested for cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, polyps etc, and have only got a very small polyp. Is this common - I mean to just lose muscle tone and become saggy during menopause? It's driving me mad. I feel hungry most of the time! I have been tested for hypothyroidism several times. I was diagnosed with it about 18 months ago, and was put on thyroxin, but then started feeling very hyper. I cam off the tablets, and ever since then, my tests have shown I havent got hypothyroidism anymore, so I'm totally  exasperated with all of this. Do I just have to spend six hours a day in the gym?!"

I read all your posts and every single symptoms you discuss I experienced while in Peri but never knew it was menopause until I came onto this forum and it was never mentioned to me as I went to see every specialist for all my complaints over the years. I'm still experiencing some hot flushes and anxiety sickness and electric shocks panic attacks etc. So basically what I was asking is do all the symptoms ever go or do we just get used to living with them? On a lighter note the symptoms a lot of you are experiencing now do improve as to be fair I'm nowhere near as bad as I was in Peri. I have had so many tests medication not HRT so if anyone has any questions I can help with please ask xxxxxxxxx Hope you all have a much better day today xx

lisa52101,2015-11-20T02:25+00:00,Non HRT treatments?,"Hi everyone, I've been menopausal for almost 3yrs now and my biggest problem until recently was night sweats. In the past 4months or so those night sweats have been so severe I have to change my bedding and shower in the night, not conducive to sleeping. More than that I've begun to have hot flushes through the day, embarrassing when it's possible to see sweat run off my face, but also I'm having incredible cravings for anything sweet. I've never had a sweet tooth and the other day I ate a whole box of biscuits to myself. I have breast tenderness and mood swings, I'm tearful, it's like having the worst pmt and pregnancy put together. I've never been someone to be overly emotional in fact most people would say I've always been very laid back and easy going. i ad a hysterectomy 12yrs ago when I was 36 due to severely painful and heavy periods but kept my overies. I can't take HRT due to high risk complications. I've tried the usual things such as reducing my caffeine drastically and I don't have any hot drinks within 3hrs of going to bed. I wear loose, natural fibres whenever possible and I keep my bedroom at a cool temperature, with a fan running all night. The irony is I always said 'it can't be too hot for me, I ove the heat' now I would do anything to get cool. also my weight is creeping up and I have severe mobility issues so getting regular exercise is not very feasible. If anyone has any suggestions I would be grateful."

Can't even keep anything in me at all have to eat saltine crakers nothing stays with me I'm tired of these stomach problems not even going back to that hospital at all. Just want to be able to eat food with out my stomach acting up.

Ruthie49,2015-11-18T16:45+00:00,Dementia fears! Need reassurance.,"I hope you are all feeling ok today. My anxiety has reached new limits today and I'm in a tunnel of fears. I'm 50 with irregular periods and many other peri symptoms for last few years including depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance (insomnia, sweats, nightmares, numbness, waking with a fright thinking there are noises when there aren't!), IBS, fatigue, dizziness, brain fog, mood swings. The mood swings have got worse the last few weeks - frequent crying, agitation, rage. I don't know whether I'm coming or going and neither do my family! I've worried about dementia before but today I read about Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), apparently Robin Williams had it, and so many of my symptoms above can be early signs. I felt sick with fear when I read it. It doesn't help that the fatigue, dizziness and brain fog is really bad today. I'm just convincing myself that all these peri symptoms are adding up to something more serious. I'm sorry but I can't stop ruminating in anxiety and even that I'm interpreting as a sign of dementia or seriious mental disorder because I just can't seem to control my anxiety and emotions right now. Any words of wisdom or comfort would be greatly appreciated. Thank goodness we all have each other to turn to, love and hugs to every one of you on this journey."

I started to take it to relieve my menopause symptoms (waking up at odd hours, feeling sleepy at odd hours, tiredness, hot flushes) I have found it to be very good, i sleep better and feel very well. When I went off it I had such terrible feelings of shortness of breath once that i ended up thinking I was having a heart attack. So i went back on it. I am quite active and have not put on weight, eat all I fancy and make sure that there is variety in my diet. (I love chocolates, peanut butter, cookies and pastries, sugar in my coffee, the odd junk meal!) I have not put on weight other than when I overdo the goodies or if I am on holiday with the family!! My husband cooks and he is so sood!!! Livial has been good, no side effects at all !! I am grateful to my doctor for recommending it. Hope it will not have any side effects in the future.

My hot flushes disappeared within 7 - 10 days of starting patches, and most days I am OK, but why do I have these dips?. Am beginning to wonder if my HRT patches are either too strong, or not strong enough. Or, am I just depressed and would be better on antidepressants? Oh I'm so confused, upset, worried, fed up. I had knee surgery in March of this year which has taken a while to recover from, my unoperated knee is now twanging (and the thought of having surgery on this makes my stomach flip), I have fribromyalgia, I'm 56 and I've just retired from work because I just couldn't face going full time, and reduced hours was not an option open to me like and on a more upsetting note my wonderful cat was killed a month ago.

Snoopy4,2015-11-10T15:04+00:00,Perimenopause suggestions needed,"I am 49, in perimenopause and miserable.  Since my symptoms began I have started a multivitamin, a B stress complex, and additional 100 of B6, a probiotic, fish oil, D3 with calcium chew and vitamin C.  I also frequently use peppermint and lavender oils.  (I ran out of the B vitamins for 5 days and got the shakes with anxiety attacks a half dozen times per day!)  My periods are all over the place and my symptoms are much worse during them.   I want to enjoy my family once again and am determined to fight this and find what works for my body.  I’m shocked and saddened at how many doctors do not take this seriously.  I have had medical work ups (blood work, tests and ultrasounds) in the past 6 months that have all been normal and told to stick it out.  Mornings (as well as during my periods) are bad but then as the day progresses (after I take the vitamin B and eat a high protein breakfast)  it gets better.  I am looking for suggestions on what to do/take before bed that may help ease my morning anxiety without perscription drugs.  I'm taking the max of vitamin B and I don't want to waste the affects of the vitamin B I feel during the day by taking it at night when I'm going to sleep. (what sleep I get)  Does anyone have any advice? I'm thinking about a progesterone creme but read a few bad reviews on them."
Beetle1965,2015-11-09T15:59+00:00,No coping today - irregular cycles,"Hi - I am getting myself in a state today. I started this perimenopause journey in earnest last January when I period that was spotting for days resulted in blood tests that said I was postmenopausal!  A subsequent test had my FSH at normal. From that point on my periods have not been at the regular 25/26 day intervals.  I have a few that are around that length 24. 27. 22 and then a gap to 39 followed by a short one of 16 days.  Then a few again around 23. 22. 26 and then another long gap 37 and a short one of 17 days.  So I guess there is a pattern there.............sort of The bleeding is horrible, it isn't heavy as such, but it just feels like it's out of control - the periods don't slowly start and peak and peter out as they have all my life.  They arrive and are full on (more watery) and then stop.  It feels as though it is a lot of bleeding but it's more like a sense of evacuation (sorry for TMI) and I get awful water retention and feel like I go down a dress size within a day of starting my period. Today I started worrying if there was something wrong! I read on the NHS website that cycles shortening and lengthening is normal but then read somewhere else about having no progesterone (no ovulation) causing these type of bleeds and that can lead to thickened lining - but it's all normal in perimenopause. Aaaargh - my anxiety is kicking in about it not being OK and also that I actually have had enough of feeling like my body is not working properly - any comfort and encouragement to just ride it out would be great. Other symptoms are manageable - the cravings for fat, occassional overheating, lack of energy, hair loss that stops and starts again, skin that is up and down - that's all fine and not as bad as it was."
grac1eg,2015-11-04T13:18+00:00,What can I expect?,"Last year I started to get horrendous knee pain, the (male) doc, sent me for x-ray, which showed arthritis. (Not too much of a surprise as I did get the odd knee twinge prior.) But a year on, I'm a totally incapacitated now by pain in both knees, which persists regardless of how many tablets I take. I read somewhere last week that it could be related to the menopause. I'm 51 and have had irregular periods for about 18 months now and it's just dawned on me that it isn't over-enthusiastic central heating, that was making me strip down to t'shirts & vests, but hot flushes - Doh! I never really get it any thought TBH, I've always just got on with things. I'm uncontrollably weepy and because of my knees totally housebound. I struggle to walk from the kitchen to the sitting room (or loo!!). I have to go up the stairs at night on all fours. My knees are also either stiff or sometimes feel weak and have given way, making me fall. To be frank I'm at the end of my tether. I'm seeing a lady doc on Monday. I'm praying that she agrees HRT will help and she'll prescribe it. But will I need a blood test or examination? I'm so squeamish about needles and terribly uncomfortable about being examined. But my ife is now so limited and joyless, I need to do something, but I'd like to be prepared and psyched up when I go. Sorry this is so long."

It started in my left leg with sensitivity in my knee area. Then when I was using the restroom, I bent over to pull up my undies and then all of a sudden I got this really tight sensation in my left thigh area like the muscle had locked up on me. I could walk and everything but my thighs felt sore when I sat down and the only relief I got was to stand. It eventually lessened up but I can still feel the effects from yesterday's episode with sensitivity and soreness. So strange. I don't know if I bent over the wrong way or what. The bathroom stall was very confining and I hadn't much space to bend over. So i kind of had to put myself in an awkward position to bend over.

I did take them for 2 months but felt terribly bloated so ive stopped taking them . That was a month ago and I feel awful again. My main symptom is feeling sad. Not just a little bit sad but sad to the point where I want to be alone .. I can't listen to the news or any slow songs on the radio as I know it will set me off. I hate myself and have driven some friends away with my constant excuses of not wanting to go out. I think some have finally got bored of me.  As I type this im alone again in my bedroom- fending off 3 children who are getting used to their mum going to bed at 7.30pm.

I still do this but I've also taken to going out every day for a 30 minute walk, sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more. I am finding it so good for the soul, being out in the fresh air. Sometimes it's hard to fit it into a busy day but after 5 hours at my desk at work it is a great way to get my hips moving. Try it and let me know if it helps you too. Having a bit of a hot flush now I'm back from today's walk but that will passs."
DDDivine,2015-11-04T06:45+00:00,"Thank Heavens, I've found you!","Hi Ladies I have been on my own dealing with peri menopausal symptoms for a very long time now.  Indifference from medical professionals and a strict clamped jaw policy from any woman I have tried to discuss this subject with has left me feeling utterly isolated. I wanted to introduce myself and hope to be part of the community so I can share my experiences, give and receive advice and support. I feel better already just knowing there is a community of women out there who are willing to be open about the fact that menopause is happening.  I have already learned a lot just scanning these pages. Looking forward to more chats. DD"

to-ramona,2015-11-02T21:26+00:00,Obsessive thoughts/exaggerated responses ...,"Quite apart from all the physical shenanigans, I find myself really avoiding ('recoiling from’ would be a more accurate description) some of my friends. Partly that's because it's what I've always done when I'm feeling crappy, and experience has taught me that I recover from any mood dips far quicker that way. I invariably prolong the low mood by sharing it with friends (plus I'm lucky to have family who are supportive). The wisdom of this strategy was borne out the last time I spent time with a friend when I was really depressed ..... Which leads me on to my point. As I've said, I realised many years ago that I'm really best left alone when I'm low  .... But a few months ago I decided I'd test it out - a friend wanted to come over and I thought it might be OK, and perhaps it might even help. After all, it's what people do isn't it? Anyway, this friend is a good friend – I recently went on holiday with her, and we have a laugh. She's not entirely insensitive, and means well. However, she CAN be completely and utterly insensitive about certain things. Exhibit A: she feels very resentful that she doesn't earn as much as her contemporaries (who have holiday houses abroad, go on elaborate holidays etc.). Now, as she earns at least £10,000 more than me, you’d think that she’d choose someone else to complain to …. But she does choose me, despite the fact that compared to me she's got riches. I had started dreading this conversation, as I always feel terrible afterwards and any subtle attempts I made to derail it failed to stop her. To cut a long story short, she came round when I was very bad – which I explained – and promptly started going on about how badly paid she is again. I was so upset that I actually said something (nothing very strong, just said it was a sensitive subject – I was crying at the time), and she did change the subject and I thought that was it [Upshot: she left, I felt 10 times worse, remembered why I don’t see people when I'm bad and vowed never to do it again!] However, this wasn't the end of it – I was dismayed to find that she brought it up again last time I saw her. I wouldn't mind, but I’d love to be able to do some of the things she's able to do, but I have to not get screwed up about it because I know how dangerous that can be (both to my own mental health and to my friendships). And here's my point (finally!). I’m a) terrified to the point of feeling sick and panicky that I will see her, b) constantly thinking about it (the insensitivity/injustice of it all), c) getting really angry when I see Facebook posts by her from all over the place (theatre/city breaks etc., which frankly I can't afford), and d) holding ‘conversations’ with her in my head (whereby I tell her exactly what I think etc.). It's totally disproportionate, and its totally doing my head in! The only person suffering is me, and although I know this academically, I just can't shake it loose. Perspective was never my strong point, but I have worked really hard on myself in order to stop these sorts of unhealthy thought patterns and my tendency for self-sabotage. I had made loads of headway, but it all seems to have gone down the pan. I just get beside myself with anger/resentment/sadness/you name it, and most of it is centred round this friend. So my question is: are these exaggerated feelings part of the whole menopause thing? I strongly suspect that they are, because I don’t normally want to kill my friends when they’ve p*ssed me off …  More importantly, how can I stop it – it’ really unhelpful (understatement). Anyway, I’ve gone out quite long enough! Comments/thoughts/advice are all very welcome… Thanks in advance, Anna."

Highlands51,2015-11-04T19:41+00:00,More on Patches,"Hi all,  hope you are well well? Background here: have not had a period in around 7 months (actually 2 light periods over previous 13 months).   Suffering with flushes like never before, also wired and angry, not like me, snapping at one and all. I found a box of estradot .25mg patches which I never used (fear of HRT), I confess should not have done, but cut one in half and stuck on arm. I started to feel weird, however flushes went and during 1 week felt strangely in control, able to string sentences together...however progessing on began to feel low/depressed/hopeless and the feeling gets worse that is until I have to apply another half a patch.  The effects lessen as patch needs to be replaced. Flushes have lessened, blood sugar levels have stablised, but what gets me is this blessed depression? I thought in my naivety that depression would be the last thing I would suffer with when using an oestrogen patch? The exact name of this stuff is Estradot (Extradiol hemihydrate) 25 mg, fairly low dose. I was just so desparate, I decided finally to give them another go. Are there any other better transdermal patches out there, could it just be the type of estriadiol.. Sorry ladies, any help much appreciated. (I probably should not have cut them in half, but i am a total novice when it comes to all things HRT!)"

It is now at the point that i have a beard and it is becoming prominent under my chin too. I am not on HRT and as I am fair haired I cannot find anywhere that would laser them. I feel bad enough going through the menopause as it is with the ususal, night sweats, weigh gain, mood swings and everything else that makes you feel rubbish. Somehow I can cope with all that but not the facial hair. I get upset and the only thing I can see that will work is electrolysis, using the fine probe into the hair shaft. As the hairs is so fine and blonde I feel it will take a life time to slow this down,or get rid of it let alone the cost. I would struggle to pay for this treatment as I have read it can take yearsto destroy the hair root.  Is this normal to have so much facial  hair.  I am so unhappy trying to deal with this."

I could swear that sometimes my heart rate is over 100BPM, but every time it's checked when I feel that way, it's well within range for a healthy resting heart....so what's the deal? Is it one more symptom I'm imagining or bringing on myself by thinking about it? And I can also feel my heartbeat all over my body...almost feels as though it's causing my body (even my head) to tremble or pulsate (if that makes sense). Is it adrealine that I can feel, as opposed to my heart rate, per se? Is my anxiety about it putting me into the ""fight or flight"" mode?

I'm 50 now and been going through some rough symptoms for a year - depression, anxiety, digestive probs. Had LOADS of scans and tests but all clear, though I'm convinced I have something wrong inside as upper abdo pain and IBS is a DAILY problem. I'm on my last day of a holiday in Spain - I nearly didn't come due to so many physical symptoms and anxiety. I've tried to relax but just have no energy for going out and I'm feeling SO panicky right now because I feel like this EVERY day. It's like I'm dragging myself through each day never knowing what to expect. These are my current symptoms, can anyone relate because I just can't believe this is normal... I'm currently having a period too... -Daily upper abdo aching/cramping/ indigestion -Lower abdo aching/cramping/bloating -Fatigue, feels like I've been drugged -Neck, shoulders, hips and thighs ache - like flu -Nausea -Waking up in morning with sick headaches, like migraine, and numb hands and arms? -Waking up feeling like I've been run over! And not feeling better as day goes on. I could go on. These sick, migrainious headaches are the worst. I've been getting them nearly every day for weeks now. I take Vit supplements and careful what I eat, no alcohol etc. But I just can't seem to get any respite. Sorry, but I feel so low. How can all my blood tests and scans be normal and I feel this ill? I'm trying to hide it from my daughter and hubby but I've got no energy for the things I used to do. And it's not just sometimes, this has been every day for months, if it's not one symptom it's another. My anxiety is through the roof. I hope you are all having better days xx"
CaliforniaMel,2015-11-02T20:40+00:00,Period or not? (warning: a little graphic),"Okay, so...I've been very irregular for about a year and a half, peri based on hormonal testing. So far this cycle I'm on CD 55. So I've had spotting for now the fourth day. On the first day I assumed it was my period starting, but it was all brown...like in the old days when I used to spot before a period (in the past couple years it's just started straight out, no brown, but I mean in more recent history). Then on the second day I had a spot of bright red plus a little clot. So I thought: Okay, this is it. Put a tampon in, didn't feel anything happened, took it out probably six hours later, tiny bit of brown and that was it. Yet I have the spotting pretty much every time I wipe. Not a lot, not enough to reach my undies (or pad, actually, I'm wearing protection just in case). Is this actually a period??? Or just some sort of ""my hormones are crazy"" spotting? I mark my cycles on FertilityFriend and so far I've just marked it as spotting. Anyone have much ligher periods while in peri?"

to-ramona,2015-11-01T16:31+00:00,Ramping up of symptoms,"I know that this is a well worn path, but  ... Having suffered major depression for most of my adult life (4 separate long-term stays in hospital, goodness knows how many different kinds of treatment - including ill-fated ECT), I finally got 'top  side' of it after a stay in a specialist unit in Newcastle 15 years ago (I didn't suddenly get better, it was still a long road and CBT helped enormously). I finally got back to work 8 years ago - after being unable to work for 10 years - when I took on being manager of a charity shop. I did this successfully for 5 years, after which I left to do a PGCE, which I loved, and am now working at an FE college - not teaching, but I'm studying for my Level 5 subject specialism in literacy and ESOL and working in a lovely team.  HOWEVER, I've been peri menopausal for about 8 years - which has been a nuisance, with bad night sweats, intensified PMS symptoms, concentration problems and an overwhelming desire to punch anyone who so much as looks at me 'wrong'(!). [This particularly applies to all women who have loftily informed me that they had 'decided not to have a menopause' (meaning, in other words, it's a 'mind over matter' issue. My interpretation of this is that they clearly have had very few symptoms and imagine that this is how it is for all women)].  Over the the past few months, my symptoms have ramped up several gears and almost every night is a sheet changing night. Worse, though, is the emotional stuff - I'm highly anxious, depressed, lethargic and just cry and cry ...  I worked SO hard to get myself well after my depression - I felt I was well for the first time in my life (I had experienced low mood since being about 11 or 12, before it got to hospitalisation when I was 31). I didn't just feel it, I really was. I'm 49 next week and feel as though I can't face it, or life in general.  I just sort of muddle through and wonder what has happened to the confident and relaxed woman I worked so hard to become. if I manage to get through the day without crying / having to lie down I'm doing well. I can't face other people - though I manage to hold it together at work. I really want HRT - I am just not prepared to go through this longer than I have to, having felt like cr*p for so much of my life already. My GP is great and agrees that this is the next logical step - NB I can't go on anti-depressants as I'm already on 3 different ones as it is (!). I have absolutely no problem with taking meds. I'm worried about going on to 'long cycle ' HRT - I'm still having periods - as I know that progesterone can have depression as a side effect. I've been trying to reassure myself that it will be OK asI will only be replacing hormones I have 'lost'.  Does anyone have any advice / reassurance? My decision to go down the HRT route has been reached after a lot of thought; it's not a split second thing.. Sorry that this has been such a long post - I could have said all this in a lot fewer words, I got a bit carried away ... Any advice/thoughts gratefully received! Thanks, Anna"

Will this wobbly spacey head stop? Will any of this crap stop? HRT isn't possible, I tried magnesium, B vitamins, herbal tablets, eating better with less sugar & salt. For personal reasons I'm now doing this meno all natural without taking anything...please tell me it will end!. With my Dr on leave for an unknown time it looks like I'll be finding a new one. I've had recent blood test, bone density scan, mammogram/ultrasound, they've all come back normal. In the meantime think I'll shrivel up in a corner & pray this will pass & I will survive 😞 Hugs to all"

In one paragraph it said the estrogen-like effects are beneficial in easing meno symptoms including the reduction of blood pressure if high...I thought that could benefit me, then....a few paragraphs later it said that soy products are high in sodium which may be harmful having a negative effect on blood pressure & those with high pressure should avoid soy products...confusing?

Until rescently I admit its naive, but I didnt know this part of life, condition or what ever label it has even existed.  I have been 'suffering' pretty much every symptom for over a year now. In 5 days it will be 1yr since I lost someone I was very cloes to ; to cancer. My dad, in my dads last 10 days before he past I only then realized my mother had full blown dementia alot more has happend since. One being Peri mno.(I did think alot of my symptoms were due to grief) Reading the 'symptom' list they sound like  life things women experience. Actually living through each symptom is almost like child birth you cant really explain the worst of it to someone who hasnt been there. Why is this part of life not openly discussed, & seems to be 'hidden away in cyber space' like a dirty little secret? I am I the verge of divorce as I suffer in my home in silence. I have a financially supportive husband but I am left alone to suffer. I did turn to my GP who was keen to throw some antidepressants my way, but what about the nausea, migraines, aching muscles, weight gain...I did end up in a counsellors office as I need to get back to work. How can you be a productive member of society when you forget simple things who will hire someone who may want to cry at the drop of a hat? Anyone who may read this thank you for taking the time, because it has helped putting it out there & reading of others 'secret' or private hell.

In the mornings when I get up tummy fine and flatish, by the end of the day feels huge. Feels like it's all slowed down and everything's working harder than it used to.

I was referred to a gynecologist and ultimatley had a hysteroscopy and biopsies of uterus and a polyp removed.  To say I've been scared and frantic is very much an understatement.  The agony of waiting for the results and feeling of fear has been overwhelming, despite the fact that I have a wonderful supportive husband and family, I still have felt lonely and desperate.  My results have come back as Endometrial Hyperplasia with no atypia and no sign of cancer at all. I have various options the most radical being hysterectomy, the other 2 options are six months of progestogen tablets with follow up to check hyperplasia has gone, the other is to have a mirena coil inserted.

julie85586,2015-10-03T15:37+00:00,confused,Hi. Just wondering if anyone can help me. I am 12 weeks post tah and BSO for large ovarian cyst and severe endometriosis. I am 40 years old so due to my age I was put on HRT patches 6 weeks after my op. These however irritated my skin so unable to get a docs appointment I left a message for them to call me but they just left me a prescription without a consultation for oral Elleste duet 1mg. I am confused as all the literature seems to imply this medicine is for women who still have a womb. I obviously don't. Does anyone else take this after having had a TAH and BSO? I am unsure whether to just trust they have prescribed correctly or wait till someone can see me to talk it through. I have left my patch on for now which is a weekly change of fem seven and is a 75mg so worried 1mg is too low. So confused. Any advice please. Thanks in advance Julie x

And of course I'm stressing, thinking it's pancreatic cancer !! My sleep patterns lately have been all off. I've been waking up in the night just hot and restless, and not able to go back to sleep. My periods still seem to be happening although the time in between is a little longer sometimes, a little shorter sometimes. I could cry like all the time. Anyway, ladies, that's my rant.

lucy91054,2015-09-22T07:12+00:00,Bloating,does anyone experience upper body bloating with peri? I came off the pill last year and not had a period since. Could peri have been hidden by being on pill? Hot flushes day and night. Also can be freezing in night and within seconds so hot it's unbearable. I am 48 thank you
Beetle1965,2015-09-21T19:50+00:00,Low mood & no muscle power,"Hi - I haven't been reading here for a while but just lately I am getting more down about the changes I am experiencing. Last year I had lots of odd 'symptoms' which were not put down to hormones, I have been under horrible stress for a few years and thought I was just burnt out.  Although my skin was changing, very sensitive, hot and cold feet, bouts of high anxiety on waking. At the start of this year I had a period that went on spotting for over a week, they tested my thyroid and hormones and one doctor said you are post menopausal with the FSH/LH reading and I needed HRT to protect me as I was 44. This sent me into a spin, I missed my first period and thought that was it, he was right.  Shock wasn't the word.  Then I had a retest of the blood and came back completely normal and have had periods ever since.  Mostly regular but very different than the last few years. I have so many sublte things going on but nothing as upsetting as the overall weak feeling I have and the low mood which is nothing I have had before.  I have had  anxiety issues most of my life, but never lacked the backbone or motivation to get going when I had too or needed too. Now..........I feel so weak, like after flu or something, I just can't sleep well, tired but wired and getting down about the physical things that are coming and going, nausea at times,  aching hip, hair is shedding like mad but partly growing back (horrible short new hair) skin on my hands is thinner and wrinkley, as is my face (completely sagged)  It is as if all the 'soft padding'/bounce has disappeared both inside and out and I feel deflated like a rag doll. My body shape is changing. This is starting to really get to me, the sense I cannot control any of it and I feel too young, or it feels too sudden, to lose my complete oooomph.  I am reluctant to use HRT and am wondering about treatment for depression, but really I am wondering if this goes away at some point. I am getting depressed with the idea that my entire personality is changing along with my body - which I have just about come to terms with and have changed my diet, upped my excercise etc.  But, the lack of ooomph is awful.  I just don't seem to care much anymore and feel a bit defeated, which isn't like me at all. Any suggestions as to what causes the loss of muscle strength and tone or is it just age - seems so sudden to me.  Maybe it's low or no estrogen - though I have had periods up to now - maybe I am coming to the end.  I don't really want that, because then HRT choices pop up as the doctor will no doubt say I need it because average age is 50/51 for menopause. I do feel a little bit at a loss as to how to make myself feel better, don't want to be complacent/accepting but then again I am not sure how much I can change - it's so tricky.  I am sure I am suffering from long term stress and weak adrenals as well."

Highlands51,2015-09-17T11:12+00:00,Anxiety/Sleep/ etc,"Hello, I hope every one is ok, weather does not help I know. Tuesday I sweated buckets after a walk, thinning hair plastered to face, not a pretty sight. I wanted to post because I don't think I have mentioned a herbal tea that has really helped me: Lime Flowers, wonderful tea and really helps with sleep.  I noted Tuesday after starting again on my tea how calm and relaxed I felt.  The anxious twitching/pacing up and done and generally feeling stir crazy. Lime flower tea is a wonderful, I discovered it last year in 2014 and find that I can take it for around 6 months at a time.  I quote from a website: ""Internally  Lime flower has both tranquilizing and stimulating qualities. It is used to relieve headaches, indigestion, diarrhea and hysteria. This herb was once thought to be so effective at treating epilepsy that a person could be cured by sitting beneath the tree. Herbal tea is taken to ease insomnia, relieve tension and anxiety, to calm children who are excitable or restless, and to reduce muscle tension. It is also a pleasant tasting remedy for menstrual cramps, colic and cramping. Due to the bioflavonoids in lime flower and its relaxing qualities, this herb is good for lowering high blood pressure and easing arteriosclerosis, along with treating palpitations and coronary heart disease. Benefits of taking this herbal remedy include reducing fever, especially in children, and it can help congestion of blocked nasal passages"". You can take a tincture also, I feel IMHO that is is slightly better than lemon balm, slghtly gentler action. I just wanted to post this because I feel infinetly better today, I feel calmer, not so nervous..and able to type a post. I hope this helps.."
Bobbins059,2015-09-19T20:50+00:00,Finally broken...need to vent,"Hi Ladies. Last night was another argument from hell with hubby, our sex life is near non-existent, I feel so crappy with everything menopausal & any thoughts towards 'a bit fun' just aren't happening..he says the lack of sex/intimacy makes him angry & frustrated(I do understand that) ""his attitude is whatever ails you, have sex, it'll make you feel better""...says he's had enough & enough of my crying/moods...wants a proper wife & told me I should go back(where I lived before moving to Oz) I feel sick, sad & lonely. The tiny bit of thread that was holding our marriage I think has now finally broken. My track record(lol) isn't great, this is my third marriage & I thought I got everything right this time but obviously not...autistic traits & discovering being asexual don't create harmony in marriage!. Maybe I should 'go back' & become a recluse, I feel I'm not worth much. How I am or going to survive all the meno/hormonal upheaval I don't know. Sorry for being a bag of misery, just needed to vent...inside, my frustration & sadness screams...I just want to be normal!  Take Care"

Has anyone any tips on how long it will be before I feel any benefits, or how I'll feel as my body begins to adjust (I've already been nauseous this morning!) I've been through a real bad spell for the last 6 months, I've been posting on both the menopause and knee problems forum (had new plastic knee cap and metal trochlea in March this year). I know I was menopausal before my op (my last period June 2014, and I was suffering hot sweats), but stress and trauma over the last 6 months seems to have tipped me over the menopause precipice! GP wanted to give me anti depressants, sertraline, but I knew I was menopausal depressed, not depressed from depression. GP was also reluctant to prescribe HRT as I suffer from migraines about 3/4 times a year, so I've had to wait to see a menopausal consultant (who happened to be a man, but he so put my mind at rest and confirmed I wasn't actually going insane lol!). Any guidance would be appreciated!"

The last two periods that I have had, I experienced spotting before my period started and the last period I spotted before and now I am spotting after. Has anyone else experienced spotting after a period? Is this a sign that I am near the end of my periods? I do have an appointment with my GYN next month but this has never happened before. Lately my periods have been all over the place. I was nine days early one month and nine days late the next. This is such a confusing and bothersome time with all of these symptoms."

ursulauc62,2015-09-17T18:59+00:00,Any advice on prolapse symptoms?,"I have had a mild bladder prolapse for a few years now, and have been able to mostly keep it under control. I believe that muscles in the pelvic area can weaken in menopause due to lack of oestrogen and collagen - this is what I have read.  Recently I've experienced some quite bad lumbar back pain, and am getting worried that the prolapse may be getting worse. I get quite bloated sometimes even though I dont eat much, and my diet is very healthy - I'm very strict on that. I am in menopause now. I was on HRT but came of it as I didnt like some of the side effects, but maybe its a better idea to be on it if lowered oestrogen levels are a problem. I am seeing the Dr for an examination next week. I did have a check for ovarian cancer just over a year ago, and everything was fine. I was feeling better off the HRT but now I'm not sure what to do."

Cindie,2015-09-17T18:46+00:00,Skipped periods,"Hi Ladies - new here! I have been going through all this for some time now.  Hot flashes are the worse!  So a little background and curious on others time frame.  I know we are all different but maybe I can get some idea what to expect next.. It started about 3-4 years back maybe 5, as the PMS symptoms went through the roof!  Then I started to notice my periods were going from 28-31 days down to being about 1-2 days early from the 28 day mark.  That would go back and forth for a couple years - sometimes on time - sometimes early.  One period came 2 weeks early during this time - then back to the other cycle.  then had a period (about 1 year ago) that was skipped and started at around 45 days.  Then back to the other pattern of on time sometimes and then a day or two early.. During this phase my periods were longer as I used to be about 5 days bleeding - it went to 7-10. Also gained weight during this time and cant seem to get it off - I try but to be honest just feel so damn blah with no energy and hungry all the time, I admit not trying too hard. So my last period at christmas last year was on time then the big changes started!  Hot flashes!  OMG - like every hour on the hour and inbetween feel hot!  Sleeping with an icepack became my new best friend! Then after decembers period didnt have a period for 95 days!  The month before I started the hot flashes calmed down.  After I started I had 3 more periods on time then nothing now again going on 91 days.  The flashes came back super bad again after my last on time period.  Now the last week flashes are on and off not so bad and today I am COLD!  Wondering if I am going to start a period again at around the 95 day mark like last time....hell if I know! So I put on some over the counter progestone cream as though - why not!  At this point feel so lousy all the time figure it cant hurt... I want to go through this natural and hanging in there but sure wish I knew when the end was coming.  This week so out of energy that just typing this seems like a chore.  Just want to get on couch and do nothing.  My husband gets on my nerves too...Seems the only person I like right now is my cat.....she never bothers me... Anyone skip a lot of periods for 3 months and if so how long did that part last?  I just want all this over with. Click here to view image"

Recently I found some old notes I made about my symptoms etc, in Nov. last year I had a very light hardly there period(forgot about that because it wasn't a full period)my last full proper period was July last year, does this mean then I haven't yet reached menopause? considering it hasn't been a year without periods yet, can all this hormonal upheaval reach a peak before levelling out? my Dr seems to think so, she seemed ho-hum about it all. Am I late being 55? are my symptoms etc normal?

My Dr gave me a script for Livial but I'm not keen on anything HRT, as I told her because of family history also I'm seeing a specialist early Oct. Have any ladies heard of menopause symptoms reaching a peak before everything finally settles? will I ever really be free of  this sh** ? Just want to be able to be the 'get up n out n do' person like I used to be & not have very day governed by how I feel, I'm only staying between my home & local area because of feeling so crappy & weird(scary) My Dr says it all passes & that no woman has been left permanently in a menopause state. Everything I read says, the last period, menopause happens at age 51, but can range from anywhere 40 to 60 maybe she thinks me being 55 I should be through & done & back to normal HUH!! 😒 am I normal & or late? oh my once joyous carefree life where are you? have you been sucked into some bottomless abyss for good?

Dot61,2015-09-11T17:36+00:00,Melatonin MIRACLE,"Hi gals.  I'm new here.  I've been chomping at the bit to share this with someone who might appreciate its significance.  Here we go.... I had a total hyst @ age 29...25 years ago.  1 year later I was 100 lbs. heavier, had thinning hair, no libido & suffered from fibromyalgia.  Great life, huh?  Well, fast forward to 3 weeks ago.  Because 15 mg of Ambien wasn't quite doing the job any longer, I decided to try melatonin.  I figured, what could it hurt, right?  O-M-G!  I took my first 5mg tablet on Friday night, slept pretty well with only 5 mg of Ambien.  That was wonderful.  But during the wee hours of Saturday morning I had the most fabulous, erotic dream about my husband I've ever had in my life!  And let's just say that we've been on a 2nd honeymoon ever since! I feel GREAT!  I'm still using Ambien, but much less.  I'm taking half the pain meds I normally take & that's because I'm in very little pain!!  I can't emphasize enough what a huge transformation this is.  I've been in constant pain for over 20 years.  It came to feel normal.  I also just accepted that the best of marriage were over & that I needed to accpet aging gracefully.  It never occured to me that I was severely deficient in anything, other than estrogen.  I did ERT for 12 years but quit due to risks. And I've lived like an old lady for years, letting my lousy health define me.  But since taking my wonderful little melatonin tablets, I've been reborn...renewed!  I've fallen in love with my man all over again.  I laugh & have a bit of energy, even after a long day.  I feel younger.  I don't know if this will last, but ladies, I intend to ride this train to the of the line!  All the doctors & specialists did over the years was pile on the Rx meds.  But no one ever suggested replacing whatever might have been lost along with my ovaries.  I lost out on too much for too long & I'm so grateful to have been given this chance to enjoy my life again.  Who'd have imagined, a $10.00 bottle of OTC counter pills that I bought at the grocery store would make all the difference in the world? Wow!   Thanks for reading, girls.  I wish all of you a similar experience.  :-)"

Considering this last week of hell since my anxiety/dizzy episode & feeling so horrible which includes BP spikes that make feel hot, woozy & somehow unsafe/unstable( if that makes sense) wth endless tears. I'm wondering whether a natural progesterone cream might help settle everything & help lower my BP. I have done a lot of reading about it with all the pros n cons....very confusing 😏 ""yes it's good, no it's not good, will wreak havoc with hormones n body, is good for mood, wellbeing & ease menopause, can lower BP, can cause dizziness or spotting...so it goes"" OMG!😳  A lady I know of has used this cream & she found it a life saving god-send. Maybe I have too estrogen & not enough progesterone, I'll be seeing my Dr Monday so will be asking what she thinks even though she & other Drs at the clinic are against HRT because of bad side effects. Will also ask for blood test to determine hormone levels. Guess Its come to a point where I have to do something, the tearful low moods etc are just about doing me in! Does it all worse before getting better? Feels like I'm floundering in quicksand. Any ideas, experiences, thoughts...Thnx Ladies xo Keep Well"

Maggie1966,2015-09-04T08:46+00:00,Menopause symptoms?,"Hello, I'm 49 and had been on the pill, with no periods, for over 10 years. Prior to that my periods were very regular and quite painful but not heavy. Since coming off the pill 8 months ago I waited about 5 weeks for my first period, then a 2nd one and third one quite regular but have now been without a period for 8 weeks or so. So 3 periods in 8/9 months. However I have been getting lower back pain, pains in my thighs and mild feelings in my groinl; that feeling of 'about to start' nearly every day. In fact one day I was convinced as the pains had ratched up a few notches (but nothing like a real period) only to be bemused when nothing happened. The only thing missing is the pre-period headaches. Is this normal? Or could it be something more sinister? I am having early mammograms due to a history of breast cancer in my family on one side but on the other side where I only have a small family of female relatives two relatives have had cancer of the womb however I am told that there is nothing to be concerned about on this side."

raelene_44389,2015-08-31T10:19+00:00,Anxiety dip again - May have to cancel holiday!!!,Hi Everyone. Having a horrible dip of anxiety/depression again.  I just wish this feeling in the body would go.  I've gone 5 months without a period and I just wonder if the last year of perimenopause is the worst.  (probably the worst time in the past 12 years) I was feeling rather well a couple of months ago and I was really brave and agreed to go on a holiday to Bali with my very supportive and loving husband and our 17 year old son. Holiday are few and far between with us due to my unsettled health over the past years.  I agreed to go thinking surely things will start to improve soon.   We are not going for another month and I just pray that this dip is over.  If not I dont know how i'm going to cope.  The plane ride will be a nightmare for starters with the added anxiety and I don't want my son to see how much i really struggle with this.  My only option is to drug up on valium if its still hanging around.  I only use valium (4mg) on really bad days just to give me a little bit of reprieve.  Please keep me in your prayers that I will be on the mend soon and be able to enjoy my holiday with some inner peace. Does the last year get worse in perimenopause as the periods start to stop?  I sometimes doubt myself with all this and wonder if it's my hormones at all or could it be something else I'm missing.  When I read other posts on here I actually get reassurance that other woman are going through the same roller coaster of up and downs and it helps ease my mind.  I would love to hear from other ladies that are having dips of horrible anxiety/depression and if it's easing the closer you get to menopause. Just feeling so lost and alone. (I've lost so much of my life) Love to all  xxxx
pam1313,2015-08-05T08:29+00:00,Menopause symptoms exacerbated?,"On 24 March this year I had a new plastic knee cap and metal trochlea (the bit behind the knee cap). I've been off work since then due to trouble with muscle wastage. Prior to my surgery i suffered numerous menopause symptoms, day/night sweats, funny turns, panicky feelings, pains in both legs. I'd discussed with my doctor about going on HRT but put if off because I would have had to come off it prior to my operation. I'm 56 and last had a period in June 2014. My night sweats have been even more horrendous since my op, but for the last 6 - 7 weeks my leg pain, in both legs, has been dreadful. I've initially put this down to walking differently because of trouble with operated knee, and I thought I was suffering with tight hamstrings. But I've also become very weepy, I ache all over, I think I'm depressed because everything seems such an effort, my sleep is disturbed and I wake in the night with a feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. I do drive but don't feel I want to leave the house on my own. Everything scares me to death. I've put this all down to feeling low, and a bit disappointed, following my knee surgery. This surgery was done toimprove my life but I feel like I've had my life taken away from me. I've just made an appointment to see my doctor later today but just wondered if there is anyone on this menopause forum who has experienced something similar following any type of surgery. I've also had fibromyalgia since the late 90's so this could well be part of my problem too - just seems at the minute like I'm in a vicious circle of pain. I've been posting on the knee problem forum since my op - if this menopause forum is anything like that one then it's a saviour! Don't know what I would have done without it!"
kim94523,2015-02-27T16:11+00:00,Anyone else losing their hair???,"Hi All! I was looking in the mirror tonight lamenting the growing thin patches of hair long my part and in the front of my scalp near my bangs... and the fact that my eyebrows (once thick, Lebanese-decent, streaks of hair) need the tattooing touched up because it's fading to show I am nearly bald on my face. This has been happening for the last 3 years+. I never credited/blamed peri-menopause because until October 2014, I had been having regular periods and, according to regular doctors, my hormones were in the ""normal"" range (I have since learned that that can change from hour-to-hour, day-to-day depending on when you test and that most FEMALE doctors or doctors who CARE about menopausal women consider the ""normal range"" too broad). Anyway, because of this, I hadn't thought this hair loss might be caused by menopause. I day dream of getting a hair transplant.

The problem is that, I can't be bothered to make new friends here, because I feel so darned awful. Today has been a very bad day, along with many, I have the curtains drawn and am in bed.  I can't seem to settle here, even though I was born here, but never really lived in this country. Some days I am filled with despair. I am on a waiting list for a psychologist, but it takes MONTHS.  I take no hormones and wonder if I should take an alternative, like a soya type thing?  I am also currently not medicated for my mood disorder (because of the waiting).  I don't even have the energy to speak to people, as I am always exhausted, nor do I have the inclination to. Which, really worries me. Because of all this, this my life has become a living nightmare if I am honest. With a few bareable days thrown in. I have no car and I cannot travel on buses etc., because of agrophobia.

I had thought I might have just gone through the menopause, with very few symptoms. However, I am now experiencing severe hot flushes very frequently. I have been making a note of when they happen, I have at least one every hour, these leave me drenched and feeling quite sick. If I am moving moving about they are far more extreme. This has only been going on for a week weeks, and I am wondering if this is normal or if I should be seeing my GP. Any advice of what I could be doing. The only thing that seems to help is taking off my clothes and living down with the windows open! This is ok whilst I'm on holiday, but not so good when I have to return to work!"

In February this year I missed a period for the first time and my anxiety and depression kicked in again. Doctor thought it was a combination of menopause symptoms and coming off Sertraline and so put me back on Sertraline. I am now on 100 mg Sertraline but still feeling anxious and edgy most days. Not much appetite, not sleeping well, feeling a bit dizzy and fuzzy at times. When my period came at end of last week I felt like the old me, but the last few days I am back to square one, anxious etc. I don't know if it is the Sertraline making me feel like this or menopause symptoms. Thinking on trying HRT to see if that makes me feel better. Any ideas? I'm totally confused as to what to do. I'd like to come off Sertraline and see what happens but at the same time, I have a job to go to (signed off just now), I need to earn money!"

dm1982,2015-08-18T00:26+00:00,Seeking alternatives to Estradiol and Progesterone,"Hi there, I am hoping to get some helpful advice regarding alternatives to hormones.  A little bit about myself: I am 33 yrs old. I suffered since I was 12 with Endometriosis, not knowing what it was until I became sexually active at 22 and had an OBGYN exam for pain.  Fast forward to 28, I had a hysterectomy w/removal of my left ovary. The Dr. opted to keep my right ovary as it wasn't completely destroyed by the cyts/endo at that point. Forward again 2 years, and I found myself in emergency surgery for a torsion. My right ovary twisted, died and had been negrotic inside for about a week.  Now, at 33, after endless tweaking of hormones, I am on Estradiol, 2mg once a day, and Progesterone. I have gained 30 lbs and am miserable because of it. My self esteem has gone down the tubes. More important that weight gain is the concern I have about side effects of long term use in hormones, including breast cancer.  I have been around and around in circles with my doctors about this, but they insist due to my age that I can not, not be on hormones. They say I will age quickly, my skin will wrinkle, hair will fall out, will not sleep, etc. ( And I have to say that when I did experiement short therm with no homrones at all, that I did indeed suffer some of they above symptoms). Has anyone or is anyone going through the same or a similiar experience that can offer support or suggestions?  No one I know understands, especially since the woman I know who are dealing with menopause are late 40's, early 50's.  It's not only physical, but also emotional, as the choice to have another child was stripped away, and my body which has alays been tall and lean is now not. I do not know how to deal with all of to this. Anyone?"

The doctor said I needed an ultrasound, which showed endometrial thickness of 5.7mm. He said that required a biopsy. I went in for an in-office biopsy, but my cervix has closed. He wanted to do a D&C in the hospital, but with my lousy insurance, it would end up costing me over $7,000! That's four months' take-home pay. He tried again after giving me a drug to dilate my cervix. Still no luck today. He said that, medically and legally, he needs to advise me to have the biopsy still or otherwise can't rule out cancer. He also said that given my ""period-like"" symptoms, he's less concerned and will go with whatever I'd like, including waiting to see if bleeding returns.

elle127,2015-08-14T20:42+00:00,Who and What to believe?,"Hi ladies, Three months ago I saw a gyne doctor about if I could go back on HRT.  I'd been on it for 3yrs 6 mths and had to come off due to having fibroids.  I weaned off and in January of this year I had finished the HRT.  However, I struggled with various peri symptoms and that is why my GP sent me to see the gyne for his/her advice.   My first appointment was with a lady doctor (not the actual Consultant but one of his team).  She advised me against going back on the HRT but did offer me the Mirena Coil for heavy periods.  I found this rather strange as it's still HRT and thought it would encourage my fibroids to grow bigger.  Anyway, the lady doctor was very negative and I came away feeling annoyed that she didn't offer me anything else.  She even said I wasn't menopausal!!!!   My appointment today was with the main man - the Consultant.  He was quick to ask how I am and said I could go back on HRT (low dose) if I felt better on it!!!  Total opposite information to that given by his junior doctor!  I told him this and he said I probably had fibroids before I went on HRT and so long as I was scanned every 6 months to check my fibroids hadn't grown then I could re-start HRT!  I also mentioned the fact that as many ladies have said on here......HRT postpones the menopause.  He disagreed with this and said that I could still go through menopause despite taking HRT.  My own body would produce hormones and my overies still work even on the HRT. So........I'm now totally confused.  What am I supposed to believe? I've been free of HRT for 8 months, last two periods have become lighter.  I know I'm not ovulating as I could tell when I was (without going into detail).   Must admit I felt LOADS better on HRT......no longer needed anti-depressant, felt energetic (now I always feel lethargic) lost weight (have put on over a stone since finishing HRT) and the list is endless.  The only thing it didn't help was my hot flushes!  But I've not found anything that helps the flushes. Any suggestions ladies?  I'd love to go back on the HRT but I've come this far....naturally, do I stick with it? Can't believe the conflicting information from both doctors!!  Doesn't give me much faith in the NHS to be honest :0 Elaine x"

Well, I went to my endocrinologist on Monday for a usual check up of my thryoid and told him that I feared my thyroid meds were too much because of the sudden hot flashes but, it's hard to know anymore because of my age and perimenopause. He decided to run my FSH and LH levels and here are the results: FSH = 79.1 LH = 54.3 Now these levels aren't flagged as low, high, or normal because there are various ranges they can normally be at depending where you are in your cycle.  Now, I have been getting my period irregularly, but still getting it (last time was early June).  It's been on a every 2 month track for a bit.   Haven't heard yet from my doctor (I got these off my lab's website).  Just wondering what you think of these levels. Thanks, Christine"

I haven't been to the doctor to see if I'm going through the change but I'm pretty sure I am. I am 47 I have only had one period since April and it wasn't much of one. I have night sweats i m madder than hell one minute and crying the next, and laughing the next. I get muscle aches and my lower back bothers me more than ever. Last couple of months I have started having what I think is hot flashes its only my face and the back of my neck feels like I'm on fire. Is that a hot flash. Help!!"
youngatheart1,2015-08-04T15:18+00:00,Nigh sweats,"Hi I am 56 and started menopause at 49. No period since early 50's. Have always had hot flashes and night sweats, but these have become worse in last couple of weeks, especially at night. Did see a menopause specialist a couple of years ago to find ways of helping who said it is life get on with it. I cannot take HRT and to be honest I do not want to as I have had a thrombosis and from my sisters experience when you stop it the symptoms come back. I have tried everything possible from the health shop and even anti depressents. I cannot understand why they have got worse suddenly and am now getting into a state as night sweats can be a symptom of cancer or so google say's (I know stop googlng). I also feel really tired at the minute as well, probably as I am lucky if I sleep a couple of hours at a time before waking boiling hot. I sleep naked with hardly any bedding, the windows are open. My poor husband is wrapped like a mummy trying to keep warm LOL. Any ideas greatly appreciated."

About 6 years ago I developed the worse case of vaginal dryness.  It was horribly painful and made intercouse impossible.  I was prescribed estring by my ob gyn and had very little change and it is ridiculously expensive.  I talked to my new hormone Dr. and he prescribed Estriol cream.  After 9 days all symtoms have disappeared completely!  I am delighted!!  Also, as the estriol works to rebuild collegon and elasticity to the vaginal area I am dabbing around my mouth to see if it will help me there as well. I will let you know.  This is a miracle to me as the estring was over $400. w/o insurance and the cream was $75. and will last 3-4 months or more. Yay!!!   I have a question to put out there.  2 days into using it I noticed soreness and slight cramping around the ovaries/groin area.  I thought I had a UTI but no back ache or burning urine.  On the 8th day the soreness has lessened but now my nipples are hard and feel bruised. Much like pre menstruation.    Does anyone else experience symtoms of this nature?  I am thinking possibly it is my body reawakening which I wholeheartedly welcome and I am conferring with my Doctor about it.  Since I just started administering it and cut back the dose after tomorrow. I am thinking this will back off.  We shall see.  It is a welcome trade off to the excrutiating pain I was experiencing and impossibility of romance with my husband.  At 55 I am not ready to say good bye to that part of my life and it has been on hold for too long already. Input and thoughts welcome please!"

Lara66,2015-07-30T09:41+00:00,The Anti-Jowel Movement !!,"Hi ladies. I was reading this morning a post from a lady (can't remember who, sorry), expressing dismay at her jowelly appearance in the mirror and I thought I'd share with you all a recent trick I discovered and which I have dubbed 'The Anti-Jowel Movement'.  Aged 49, I too recently discovered jowels and for the first time in my life, I found myself thinking about having a facelift !! Now, that shocked me because I've always been a great believer in growing old gracefully so I set about googling and looking for advice on how to deal with a jowelly appearance.  What I found reminded me of a great piece of advice my late mother gave me and these two things, used together, are already having an effect.  My mother's advice was to moisturise the neck upwards, which I was doing but have recently forgotten to do and have now developed a double chin. So I have resumed this process and also am following the advice found on the internet for jowels. Using the back of your hand, slap yourself lightly but firmly on the underside of the jawline and keep doing this till it hurts! Honestly, I saw almost instant results and do these two things every time I shower and moisturise. I even think my double chin looks better.  Facial muscles, like any muscles, need exercising to remain firm and the appearance of jowels is a result of no exercise of the facial muscles. It made sense to me and as I say, the two exercises seem to be working.  I'm still a little jowelly but it has definitely improved. Anyway, just a little bit of useful info to help us through this ageing process. Hope others find it useful too. Wishing you all good health xxx"
Sandeevie,2015-07-28T11:11+00:00,Feelig like S*** Is this normal??,"Good afternoon Ladies,  I think I just need some reassurance that I am not a hypochondriac!  I only found out I was Peri about six weeks ago I went to my doctor because of my night sweats I was worried that I had diabetes as they had been happening for a while and my eye sight seemed to be getting worse. When I sat down with my GP she explained I was starting my menopause and these were the symptoms starting. Ok I thought now I know it’s a relief, but in the last three weeks I feel like I am falling apart! I am so tired (I crash at work which is embarrassing) I feel sick all the time and I have terrible heart burn, I can handle the flashes but it’s the feeling so low that is getting to me. I have suffered with depression before when my Mum suddenly died but I don't think I felt this bad I really cant concentrate I forget silly things am I going mad surely things cant change so quickly...can they? I really have no energy for work or home all I want to do is sleep then I cant!  Sorry Ladies I just not the type of person to go to the doctors usually and for all this to start so quickly I am worried I am imagining it I feel like a hypochondriac always moaning to my poor hubby, I don’t have any friends I would talk to about this and I feel that I would be moaning if I did, so any advice or just reassurance that I am not going mad would be great.

I will be 51 in October so I am expecting all sorts of symptoms, but my periods have been pretty much regular to the day each month, apart from a 3 week late blip last year. Early this year I had 4 periods in 2 months then it all settled down again. The last period went on and on for about 10 days. I was due about a week ago and started getting the usual signs the week before - ratty one minute, weepy the next, bursting into tears at the drop of a hat.... A week ago the bloating started, along with heartburn that is more like severe stomach burn! The last few mornings I have woken up looking about ready to give birth! This is all so uncomfortable and seems to be getting worse the later my period is and it's driving me nuts! Pregnancy is out. I was getting night sweats with my periods the last 2 years but now it seems a more all-over heated feeling, even on a cold night. During the hot weather last month it seemed I couldn't cool down some evenings, even sitting outside when others started feeling chilly. I mowed my dad's lawn last week, on a cool day, and was red and overheated in minutes! So exhausted this last week / 10 days (I usually feel more energetic after a period). Short term memory shot to pieces, sleeping heavily some nights, fitfully others. Poor concentration, eye sight not what it used to be... Is this increased instance of bloating and a burning stomach also symptomatic of peri? It's driving me mad and I've hardly eaten today, skipping breakfast most days because I don't feel hungry til late morning. Time for more Gaviscon, I think!"

In my early thirties I had a complete hysterectomy and within 2 years of this I developed Menopause. The main problem with this is uncontrollable hot flushes. These are so bad that I literally drip with sweat on my face and my torso is constantly perspiring. Even in the winter I have to have 2 and sometimes 3 fans cooling me down. In the summer heat my flushes are virtually unbearable. It goes without saying it has made me constantly depressed. I have tried virtually everything from a large number of prescription drugs of differing types, including HRT, and a lot of herbal and alternative remedies, none of which have helped in the slightest. I asked to see a Gynecologist I was not given an appointment but the Gynecologist simply wrote back to my doctor and prescribed anti-depressants which he felt might help. Needless to say it has'nt. I have been reading that Botox can be quite effective for hot flushes and I was wondering if anyone on this Forum had used this for their hot flushes and if so how effective is it?

He has also recommended to place the mirena coil to help with the heavy bleeding. What I would like to know is does any of this work? Been reading a few posts and this seems to be the normal mode of operation for doctors, for all women, with similar symptoms. Reading a few other posts about women experiencing pre-menopause/ menopause there has really not been any real research into any proper cure or medicine to help with giving women a real relief of the same symptoms over and over again, makes me wonder if men suffered from these same complications if there would have been loads more research money used to find a clear cut cure. ;-) All discussions and books on this subject only gives us what other women have found works for them as advice . It would be great if there was a handbook we could get that says exactly what you can do to get through these life changing times :-) Anyone know if there is one out there?"

susan556,2015-07-24T08:32+00:00,ADHD drug Vyvansegiven to menapausal women!,"Shire Pharmaceuticals made a fortune selling its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) drug Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) after convincing doctors to prescribe it to millions of children across the globe. Now, you may have heard the name Vyvanse somewhere else and that's because the drug was recently approved for a completely made-up condition called Binge Eating Disorder — a ridiculous diagnosis that can be given to anyone that sometimes turns to food for a bit of comfort (we've all been there). But as if that wasn't enough, Shire Pharmaceuticals has one more trick up its sleeve to expand the market for Vyvanse. Fantasy disease The drug maker now claims that Vyvanse can help keep menopausal women's brains razor sharp and improve something called ""Executive Function""... and if the drug gets approved to treat this fantasy disease millions of women could be at risk of heart attacks, strokes, and even sudden death. ""Executive Function"" is one of those made up umbrella terms that get tossed around a lot. It basically means mental skills that allow you to pay attention and complete a task. A recent study, funded by none other than Shire Pharmaceuticals and the US National Institutes of Health, makes the silly and completely unsupported claim that Vyvanse could possibly help improve memory loss and concentration in menopausal women. If this is not proof that Shire Pharmaceuticals can sell Vyvanse to treat just about anything, then I don't know what is. To make this whole thing even more of a scam, the claim that Vyvanse will keep your brain as sharp as a razor is complete codswallop. Women already taking the drug have complained of ""mental fog"" and ""confused thinking."" Some women believe they are actually ""losing their minds"" while on Vyvanse. One Vyvanse patient named Lara said that while on the drug she couldn't remember even simple things, such as the names of her children's teachers. So much for that Executive Function cure. And while most menopausal women won't see any brain benefits from Vyvanse, many will be left dealing with its debilitating and even deadly side effects. I'm talking about anxiety, irritability, nausea, dizziness and vomiting. Vyvanse also can send your blood pressure skyrocketing and if you have a problem with your heart, taking the drug could even result in ""sudden death."" Could it be that when your heart races and you're nauseous and having an anxiety attack that you actually think better? I seriously doubt that.  Sue"

I can go all day long with no blood but then all of a sudden there will be a slight jelly like discharge with blood stain in my knickers. I guess it's like a bloody mucus.

barter1960,2014-07-28T16:14+00:00,Serum Estradiol levels with estrogen implants/injections,"Hi I've been postmenopausal due to premature ovarian failure related to having a partial hysterectomy for nearly 20 years. My symptoms were managed for 7 years using estradiol pills. I was then switched to a patch which worked well for me for nearly 12 years...although I had to use a patch and a half of the highest dose patch. I'm from the US, but my patch was the Vivelle Dot  which is the same are the Estradot 100 in the UK. I can't say that I have ever felt completely normal after having my surgery and immediately experiencing ovarian failure when I was 35. I am now 54 and have been trying to find the right implant dose that works best for me. Here in the states, most implant/pellet docs insert very low estrogen doses and huge testosterone doses. That regiman really messed me up and it has taken my testosterone a year to decrease to a level where I feel well. I had to change doctors in order for that to happen. My new provider started me off by giving me 100 mg. E implant and 100 mg. T implant. I don't think he clearly understood that my testosterone was over the top. He lowered my testosterone implant to 50 mg. and left me estrogen implaint dose at 100 mg. during my last visit, gave me a 5 mg. depo estrogen shot to boost my level and keep me comfortable until the estrogen implant kicked in. As soon as the injection wore off, all of my symptoms returned. I have always had severely debilitating symptoms from low estrogen. My implant doctor does not dose based on lab work but by symptoms only. I recently visited my GP for my annual exam and he ran some routine blood work as well as a hormone level check. My estradiol level was 985.3 and my testosterone was 122 which is great. However, he flipped out over my high estradiol level. I had given myself and injection a couplf o days before and wonder how much it affected my estradiol reading. Now, my implant doctor who originally said that labs were ""only numbers"" wants to lower my estrogen implant dose and take the estradiol shots away. I feel the best I have felt in 20 years and am not having any side effects at all. Have any of you ever needed your estradiol/estrogen/oestrogen (all the same) levels as high as I seem to need mine in order to feel well?"

He says fibroids are not serious , I am just wandering as I think I'm defiantly going through menopause if it will just shrink and go on its own.

geraldine403,2015-07-05T22:38+00:00,Is this normal?,"Evening ladies,for the past year or so,I've noticed a change in taste buds. Foods that I've eaten for years are so strong and bitter (For example mature cheese) So much so that it's uncomfortable to eat it because it tastes so much stronger than it used too. Other foods are just so bland! Has anyone else had the same problems,or is it just me?"
geraldine403,2015-06-30T16:28+00:00,Feeling depressed,"Hi all, i'm looking for some advice please. I've been told i'm probably going through the menopause (I'm 51) and my periods have been all over the place for a good 6 months. My problem is that I've bled for 33 consecutive days and when i did stop bleeding, it was only for 2 days. It started again 4 days ago. Basically out of 39 days, i've bled for 37 of them. Please tell me this isn't normal, or even if it is that i can get help from my gp. I'm so depressed and down about it. I'm scared to go out incase i ""Leak"". Sometimes it's so heavy that i have to change my sanitary wear after just half an hour. I lose quite big blood clots too and when i do, I seem to have a heavier rush of blood.

victoria83983,2015-07-02T03:29+00:00,Periods getting further apart at 45yrs old. Is this the start of peri menopause?,"It seems that my periods have starting getting further and further apart. I used to be very regular and have them every 28-30 days. Then a couple of months ago it became 35 days, then two weeks later I had it again but very slight. Now it's already 45 days and nothing. I have all the PMS symptoms but no period. My OB said just to wait till it comes. I've read in another thread about women getting lots of continuous bleeding, but mine is the opposite. I'm also getting mood swings, feel lethargic, have insomnia, and just a general feeling of blah! I've done a PT and it was negative. Just in case that was the reason for my missed period. I just want it to come already! Anybody else with a similar situation?"

I am convinced it's going to be bad news because of my symptoms. For a while I thought it could be perimenopause, but not sure now.  I keep having really really scarey things happen, often out of the blue which just confirm my concerns.  aside from short term memory loss, I keep getting all sorts of things confused.  I've tried to put the front seatbelt on whilst sitting in the back of a car, I though I had lost my mobile phone, but I was talking on it.  And then just now I got really confused between a friend and my sister and who was who.  I just can't go on like this or believe it could be hormones.

Beetle1965,2015-07-02T16:33+00:00,Fluid retention in feet/ankles,"Hi - I am in perimenopause and my periods have become irregular, at the same time as this my PMS symptoms have changed.  I used to get some sense of bloating before my periods, generally around my tummy and slight puffy ankles. I have now periods of quite pronounced ankle and foot swelling and also a general sense of clothes being tight around my thighs.  Then I will feel 'thinner' a while later. When the ankles first 'blew up' I was freaked out, the GP said it was idiopathic edema (I'd recently had screening blood tests and hormone tests) so he said it was age and lack of excercise and perhaps I would need support stockings.  I asked if it was hormone related and he said no. These episodes happen before a period and during it and then subside - I am wanting it to be hormone related because somehow, the swollen feet and ankles are really effecting me.  I feel old and actually quite uncomfortable with it all. So far I have upped my water intake, wondered if I am actually low in salt (I never add it to food and don't eat a lot of prepared foods), I elevate them and this helps a bit - but basically the pattern so far has shown they go down after my period. Anyone have this and any remedies that might help - I have read epsom salt helps with fluid retention."

However the result of my pee showed no abnormalities. Now it gets embarrassing. I keep smelling a fishy aroma. Arrggghhh I can't believe I've said that!! I understand that it could be an infection but wouldn't it have shown up in my pee sample? Also is this likely to be connected to my hormones? Thanks lovely ladies.

susan21149,2015-06-28T14:48+00:00,Depression and anxieties with menopause,"Hi ladies yes i have been depressed and anxious due to my menopause symptoms. Yes Ativan generic Lorazepam is not cut out to deal with depression so i asked my medical doctor for Neurontin which is used for epilepsy but it is used for anxieties and depression too. I have been on 100mg twice a day and i feel like i am not as anxious as i use to be.  Yes the palpitations are still there but not as bad to where i am crying and feeling more anxious. I feel like the neurontin is helping me lesen my anxieties a bit but i still need to do my relaxation stuff and i need to tell myself that i am okay nothing is wrong.  This is hard to do but i need to just let these hormones go and not talk about them any more and just let my body work its self out  This is what i am saying let your hormones go yes it anxiety provoking and yes its scary when we have all these symptoms and the doctors tell us our hearts are okay nothing shows up on the EKG as a heart attack or on the monitors so why are we females so concerened that something is wrong with us when there is nothing wrong with us accept that our hormones are just acting up and our anxieties with our hormones.  We need to learn about our bodies and understand that we are all going to have palpitations, fast heart rates, anxieties, depression, a lot of mood changes but we are in control we need to take control of our minds and our thinking.  I feel that this neurontin is going to help relive a lot of my depression and anxieties  Today i feel a little like myself with a little bit of anxieties but not much. I would advise ladies who do not want to take HRTs to talk about neurontin for depression and anxieties. to help control the symptoms of menopause.  Happy hug and a lot of prayers to you ladies"

I had to change my email registration because for some weird reason, it wasn't working.  So, I am new and not too familiar with the site, therefore, I don't know if you are supposed to start a new discussion if you have a new concern. So forgive me.....

Can't talk much today....thank you so much again ladies. Sending lots of hugs and love to everyone, Misha"
misha.peace,2015-06-20T08:11+00:00,Menopause is making my anxiety worse...please help!,"Hello,  First of all, let me express my gratitude to all of you who have shared everything here. And, I am so, so relieved to find this place to talk and share because I am just totally exhausted.  SORRY, IT’S GOING TO BE A VERY LONG POST…but please be patient with me because I have never had a chance to share my troubles with anyone before. I am so thankful that there is actually a place where other women feel as I do. I thought I was going crazy. I also have some NATURAL REMEDIES that might help some of you so read on…… I am 53 and I have been skipping my period since 2013. So, I am just sick and tired of battling my symptoms for almost 3 years now. As I write this, it's like 2 a.m. and of course, I can't sleep! I have been having jelly legs or just feeling weak in my arms right above the elbows and in my legs right above the knees. I have horrible anxiety plus mild panic attacks including foggy head and a little dizziness if I put my head down. I have read a lot of posts and unlike some of you, I have not had any hormone tests or any other tests. Because I just can’t afford them. I have not been even diagnosed for menopause! I have been unable to work due to my conditions because of my horrible anxiety issues. My anxiety is so bad that I just can’t really be at a workplace for long periods of time. I try to do part-time work or work from home which is impossible to find. Even though, I have excellent education. So, if some of you have any suggestions about or where and how I can find some work from home, I would be indebted to you forever! I have a masters. I have had anxiety issues since I was in my late 20s due to a few incidents. But, now it’s has like totally skyrocketed! I am confined to my home. Sometimes, I stay home for like 8 days and don’t leave! Because I am afraid that if I get one of my panic attacks (they are mild but very scary!) what am I going to do. I kept on thinking that I have some terrible disease and the worst part was that I couldn’t really explain HOW I felt to a doctor so how would it be treated? I couldn’t explain the head fogginess, just feeling crazy at times like I am really sick and going to die or something really stupid. To add to this drama, I could not make myself go to the doctor because I was so panicky that if I go and what if they find something horrible! Now, that’s just awful. So, I went on living like this for about 4 years now! Then, my anxiety got so bad that one day, I just went to get a check-up at a hospital where they have urgent care. So, all my blood tests came out normal but I had a UTI! The UTI was giving me horrible fast heartbeat and pulse including nausea! Because after I took the antibiotics, the fast heartbeat and pulse diminished and the nausea. However, the anxiety did not! So, I got some courage and went to see a gyno. However, I don’t have medical insurance which makes everything worse because they give you those pro bono doctors who could care less about you! She was really rude and insensitive to me! She said you are not a teenager, you are an adult! Take care of yourself and don’t think about herbal remedies! Act like an adult and get on HRT!! And, if that doesn’t help you then you have bigger problems!! She hardly touched me and just prescribed HRT. Then she said, “See you in 3 months!” And, I was like what about my pap smear??!! So, then I wanted to change the gyno but they only had ONE gyno! So, I got a pap smear and the nurse practitioner was much nicer, sweet and very empathetic to my concerns. So, now I am just living day to day and trying to deal with my anxiety somehow. My friendships and relationships have suffered as well. My IRA has almost finished because I have been living off of it for a few years now. I read here in one of the posts that one lady has been in perimenopause for about 9-10 years!!!! Omg…I don’t think I can handle that! I CAN’T drive in traffic and I almost want to jump out of my car on a red light and just leave the car and walk away!! I take long inside routes and do not take the highway because I feel stuck if there is traffic. I do not go far away from home because I am scared of if I get really sick or get a panic attack and there would be no one to help me. Generally, I don’t have a feeling of well-being and especially in my head. I can’t explain the exact feeling. I feel restless and nervous in my head. It’s worse if I don’t get enough sleep.    Anyway, I used to take B-Complex regularly with women’s vitamins. But because what I have read here, I will go buy B-6 and 12 and hope to God that it helps my anxiety. REMEDIES ***** please try Kava Kava for your anxiety but only the root not the stem kind. Linden flower leaves or tincture or tea is very good. Also, you can mix turmeric in milk with some honey to drink which will soothe your joints and relieve some of the pains that you might have. You can buy turmeric from the indian grocery store. If you have diabetes, you can buy Fenugreek seeds from there and wash them like half teaspoon and then soak them in water overnight. Then, in the morning, strain the water and drink it on an empty stomach, this IS a surefire way to bring your blood sugar down. But, please continue with your meds and check your sugar so that you know how low or how high it is. In India, they have been using turmeric, fenugreek seeds and so many other herbs for thousands of years and we just have come to know now about only a fraction of them. For your anxiety, you can also try “alternate nose breathing” and believe me that works wonders! You can google it. MEDITATION and YOGA are definitely a PLUS. Join a class now!! Deep breathing always helps! If there is ANYTHING for anxiety that you guys can suggest, please do. My main problem is that and I WANT my life back. I want to be normal and independent as I used to be. Because right now, I feel like a cow who is tied with a rope around her neck to a pole!! Thank you so much for listening!!   Good luck to everyone…hang in there….we all are here to help each other and give support and I am wishing everyone the best and you guys are all in my prayers. Love, Light and Blessings. Misha"

star2sparkle,2015-06-20T07:09+00:00,"Doctors won't take me seriously, help!","I am 44 years old and at my wits end. I hope someone may be able to offer some sage advice :-) For the last year or so I have been experiencing a worsening of anxiety (have had anxiety for years caused by trauma in childhood) feelings of malaise, fatigue, aches and pains, headaches, period pains without a period, nausea, ibs, temperature changes and thought that maybe I was in the perimenopausal stage. I went to the doctors, explained all this and asked about HRT. They didn't do any hormone checks (or any other blood work) and no physical examination. Put me on evorel sequi patches. Did at first suggest anti-depressants and I know they do this to fob patients off. But I continued to suffer and anxiety increased. So I asked for proper blood tests. Found to be deficient in vitamin D and low fellatin levels and high levels of folic acid (I am a vegetarian) and everything else can back fine. I am now taking multi-vitamins, vitamin B complex, iron and vitamin D. The hormone levels were checked and were okay but of course, taking hrt may have skewered them. I have been to the doctors several times, in the hope they would take me seriously but to no avail. I don't know if I am in the perimenopause stage or not (periods are erratic, if at all). I often feel as if I am premenstrual but don't have a period. Then I am also on Micronor (mini pill) and the last doctor said I shouldn't be taking both! Another doctor said I was too young to be in the menopause. I am so confused and all the while, the health concerns continue. One doctor just told me to sleep more! I have small fibroids too and sometimes I get such extreme period pain in the back, down my legs but often no period. So I asked the doctor if I should come off HRT if I am not beginning the menopause. One said you can just come off it even though I said I'd read that wasn't advisable and another said to simply cut the patches in half! I am so sick and tired of my doctors and have wondered about making a complaint. I think they believe I just want reassurance but I just want to feel better! I don't even know if I should be on HRT! Sometimes I can put on a patch (now half a patch) and get extreme period pain (often on the side where the patch is, put it on my hip). Does anyone have similar experiences or advice please? It would be gratefully appreciated."

MI have discovered there's another reason....Flourescent lighting! there's been times when I've gone out & I've probably mentioned it here in my posts that I feel odd thinking it all a menopause thing but after much thought & process of elimination( I started to feel better when I went back outside away from the shops) I thought of the fluro lighting that is in nearly every shop, so I googled the effects of this type of lighting....very interesting!, fluorescent lighting can cause panic attacks, anxiety, headaches even fits/seizures, this is because there's a level of pulsing in the light which isn't seen but effects the brain AND some shops/malls are worse than others depending on the amount of lighting used. Many times in the past I wondered why I would feel agitated when I'd been out shopping, quite possibly the lighting. Talking of anxiety etc, Vitamin B's...may have been mentioned here before but they too can cause anxiety in some people, I no longer take them...but talk to your Dr before stopping or starting any supplement. For B vitamins I now have a good dollop of malt extract mixed into my porridge every morning, nice n natural. Do hope this has helped, is worth a thought... Keep Well, hugs n 💐  to you all"

I'm on the frozen shoulder forum too as have been suffering since March with a frozen shoulder. im 51 in three weeks so the right age for this stuff, my mum passed away very suddenly 6 months ago and my world turned upside down. I'm struggling with grief and I know that it's now being compounded with this other problem. Ive been on a period for two weeks and having strong period pains, feel very tired no enthusiasm and very tearful.my hair is thinning and dry and frizzy and by skin is extremely dry.No night sweats but am waking up very hot. whats happening to me I feel like I'm going mad.

youngatheart1,2015-06-14T07:47+00:00,How old where you when flushes stopped,"HI all, I am 56 and still having severe flushes, I started around 48 and have not stopped. I have tried all the over the counter stuff nothing works for me, I am not able to have HRT as I had a thrombosis and to be honest my sister was on it for 12 years came off and the flushes were back so is back on it. HRT only holds it off does not cure it according to her GP. The only thing that worked for 1 month and then stopped was citalopram but I ended spaced out. Do just doing what nature intended grinning and bearing it (only just). Yesterday was hell, shopping for outfit for posh function and I spent the whole day dripping, I felt so disgusting, my hair was stuck to my head, I know I stunk and people close by could see the sweat running down my face. Not very feminine. So fellow sufferers put me out of my misery, will this ever go away, why does it get worse and then subside to being more managable. Not even sure if this is menopause as I have been feeling very woozy and wobble when I get up sometimes.. I am having palpitations as well, Wondered if I was lacking in vitamins as I am a long term user of PPI's."

Don't really know what I'm doing or going to do or want to do, in some of my posts I've added humour to try & lighten the turmoil within. This is a confession to oneself, what I should have done long ago! I've tried being normal to fit in all my life but to no avail, I guess having many autistic traits which have made any social situations near impossible & not having friends to share life with & now all this menopausal crap which I don't understand & finding it all hard to cope with....just everything sucks! the intimate side of my marriage is suffering which always causes arguments & just makes me think 'I shouldn't be here' I feel like a blob of nothing, sexless, useless, a nuisance & I feel lonely, alone. The many things I've had to deal with through my life especially concerning my kids which I now have little contact & my grandkids...can't go there, how I survived it all, don't know how I did. On my own I moved to Oz to start again & now in my third marriage, thought I got everything right but maybe not, im still failing. Is like a case of damned if I do damned if I don't...just everything seems so wrong. My apologies ladies for this long n miserable tirade of woe, I don't mean to create any grief.

This does not seem a ""normal"" menopause symptom does it ? Why after everything that I swollow? I worry because I have quite bad gum disease with some teeth leaking infection into my mouth.....maybe its the infection causing the hot sweats and flushing as I take bacteria into my stomach. I have been to dentist who tells me to just keep on cleaning my teeth but its not working the infection isnt clearing. I dont know what is causing the hot sweats and flushes. All my blood tests are normal except the female hormones which my doctor says is border-line peri-menopause and i havent had a period since April (2 months missed periods)...so the sweats could be menopausal. I just dont get why after everything i swollow...unless it really is dental related. I get butterflies in my tummy before the hot flush too. What does anyone think...i feel like i am loosing my mind, the dental infections/peridontal disease is driving me mad, i cant believe the dentist wont extract my teeth but rather keeps on cleaning infected teeth !"
Spongebobby,2015-06-13T20:29+00:00,Is it Perimenopause?,"Hi! A few months ago I started getting night sweats so went to the doctor and she took bloods for different checks including hormones. She mentioned the start of menopause but as I'm 42 she said it was a bit early. Anyway all bloods came back fine and the night sweats stopped. Since then though my periods have been all over the place. My cycle is usually 26 days but it has been 19 then 11 and now I'm a week late! I'm not getting really achy mucles/joints. My wrists and elbows are the worst, a dull achy pain which ends up feeling like a dead arm and my ankles are aching but not as much. I'm also getting very stiff legs and knees, especially in the morning or when sitting watching TV, my left hip is sore everytime I stand up. Basically I'm falling apart!

I am 44 years old and basically since the beginning of this year I have physically become a different person at least 2 weeks out of every month. It is becoming nearly debilitating. I have an appt next month with my gyno. The symptoms have included hot flashes ( which no one can understand until they experience for themselves), I think the onset of the hot flashes each month then trigger severe anxiety/panic attacks. I am not sleeping during these symptoms. I am able to fall asleep but usually wake up sweating and in a full on anxiety mode. This month I am experiencing severe almost like morning sickness symptoms (I am definetly NOT pregnant) literally throwing up today from nausea. I am just beginning this journey..

laura80566,2015-06-10T05:36+00:00,Feeling Really Really Scared,"Just back from Radiology.  Radiologist took a second lot of photos after speaking with her superior and showing him the photos she had already taken.  She told me not to worry because he is a perfectionist and often asks for more photos.  She said she couldn't see anything to worry about but noticed that my right ovary was enlarged.  She also said she wouldn't tell me if something was wrong anyway. I am worried about ovarian cancer (only have one ovary) because just prior to my last period (first in 3 months), I became bloated with gas and fluid.  I also developed distention around my waist.  I had an upper UTI around that time too that caused blood in urine.  A urine dipstick test showed positive for Leukocytes in the urine but nothing grew in the petri dish.  Once I started antibiotics the blood in the urine stopped. I have been: - Having frequent urination (sometimes urine feels hot but not burning).  - Feeling full after small meals. - Suffering upper abondimal pain (sharp shooting above belly button). - Bloated with gas and fluid. - Belching and Flatulence. - Nausea now and again but that might be due to anxiety. - Lower back and upper back pain. The bloating has reduced by 80%.  The distention around the waist is still there.  The back pain has resolved.  A pap smear returned normal. I am going through perimenopause and put these symptoms down to that.  I am worried it might be ovarian cancer.  I had benign cysts in that ovary about two years ago and a thickened urterine wall. Am stressing."

laura80566,2015-06-08T08:45+00:00,Panic Attack,"Hi Ladies, I am having an acute panic attack.  The gas, bloating (abdomen and waist), lower abdominal heaviness, fullness after meals, intermittent back pain are making me wonder if I have ovarian cancer or endometrial cancer.  These symptoms started just prior to my last period (after not having period for 3 months). The gas and bloating is 80% reduced in the morning but as soon as I start eating I blow up for the rest of the day (although the thickening around the waist is always there).  The upper abdominal sharp shooting pain isn't as frequent (it is getting less). I have been diagnosed with borderline Celiac and an upper UTI.  I elimiated gluten about 10 days ago.  The spotting and watery blood (now and again) resolved after a few days of being on the antibiotics for the UTI.  No blood or spotting since. I thought the bloating may have been caused by the UTI.  Then I found this forum and discovered the gas, bloating and pain could be explained by perimenopause symptoms. I'm having a panic attack now because I remember the gyno diagnosing me with a thickened uterine lining a couple of years ago.  He sent it off for a biopsy and it was clear.  I forgot about it until I read the symptoms of endometrial cancer (I have had endometriosis and ovarian cysts in the past with them returning negative for cancer). It's been a couple of years since the all clear but I am worried that my symptoms might be cancer as well as perimenopause. Sorry for the lengthy post."

I was given Progesterone (oral tablets) and estrogen to be used vaginally. I was reluctant to take them since I was not given a blood test or anything.  Plus, I am a bit suspicious of medications due to a medical phobia.  At first the idea of using estrogen vaginally appealed to me since it would reguvenate the vaginal tissue? That was a question.  Are any of you using natural supplements with success? If so I would so appreciate if you could share your experience and how they helped (symtom wise).  My main issues are moods, depression, crying, bloating, vaginal dryness, Lichen schlerosus, bad sleeping etc., Thanks very much! Oh and one final question, can I use the estrogen internally and leave out the Progeserone? (Seems that it is less harmful and less absorbed as it works on the area locally)."

shaznay96184,2015-06-02T20:21+00:00,"Finally.....NICE is developing Menopause Guidelines for GP. Too little, Too late???","Hi All Blimey, we are a popular bunch!  See we made the news all day in the UK yesterday. We've actually got those lovely people in NICE finally acknowledging that our GPs really need to be singing from the same songsheet - or actually having a copy of the 'sheet' in the case of some GPs, clearly! - with regards to helping us ol' birds during Peri/Menopause!!  And about time too! But is it a case of too little, too late for a lot of us?  I'm not actually taking conventional HRT at the moment.  I don't rule it out for the future (never say never and all that), but do hope that by the time I go back to my GP (not the dosey Nurse 'Mrs Happy Pills' Practitioner next time!!) I'll be treated like a rational, mature woman, and given proper options of treatments to help me. Emmmm, it will be interesting to see how long it takes the average GP to get their head around the ever-increasing list of symptoms of Peri-and Menopausal symptoms. I think that list off 66 symptoms is growing weekly! It will also be nice to see how often younger ladies (those outside the 'committed in stone' age brackets of 45-55!!) continue to be fobbed off still when they describe obvious Peri symptoms to be told they're 'too young' to be Peri!!!   We shall all wait with baited breath no doubt to see if NICE's guidelines actually work.  Hopefully there will lots more help for those enterring Peri, if not for ourselves.  Anyone else read/hear anything specific about this issue yesterday? Sx"

I have been getting heartburn ever since I entered peri but it seems that when I am ovulating I get it worse than other times. My GI said that the receptor sites for progesterone and estrogen are located along the digestive tract which why we experience such digestive upsets during hormonal fluctuations.  I had a c section two years ago and during that procedure the OB had to scrape scar tissue from my bowels which formed there from a previous abdominal surgery. When I explained my experience to my current GYN, he said anytime there is manipulation to the bowels it can result in things like having heartburn. The bowels are very sensitive and don't react well to being tampered with. Oh boy!"

It took around 2 years to completely go and ive been fine since then until january this year. I had a dizzy episode and my blood pressure was slightly raised and this made me panic so much that i was making it worse. I had at least 4 nights lack of sleep. Doc gave me a short course of diazepam which help calm u down. Started to ease after around 2 months until we went  away and our daughter had a seizure which led to 6 more seizures and she was airlifted to hospital in Cornwall. I have been a mess ever since. Shes fine but i keep watching her in case it happens again, i keep going dizzy and my ears feel blocked but doc sayas they are fine. Every time i start to feel better my daughter has another moment where i think she is going to fit and i start panicking all over again and worrying about my blood pressure. I am 45 and think im getting menopause symptoms. Would like to hear of other peoples symptoms to compare. I feel like i need constant reassurance that im going to be ok. Keep thinking theres something seriously wrong with me. I eat fairly healthy, i eat a lot of spinach and avocados etc. I get head tremors some times and get spotting and my periods are sometimes a day early and last a bit longer.

Beckyboop,2015-05-30T09:30+00:00,"Angelic not working for me, post-menopausal","I am 56 and post-menopausal, I have had really bad symptoms for the last year but, have been experiencing them for at least the last 5-7. I had really bad acne and heavy periods so my doctor put me on Dianette, I have since found out I should only have been on it for 3 years max but, I was on it for 17! It was fab, no spots, great hair and periods were more contained. I started to get really bad migraine/ withdrawal symptoms when I took a break to try and come off and experienced clots, I bled for 2 weeks every month, flooded, it was difficult as still working. about a year ago my doc put me on the mini pill, he said I should not be on Dianette. no more periods but, on the downside my acne came back and my hair started fulling out. I have read forums on Dianette and this is ccommon, I have now controlled it by taking hair supplements and whilst it is thin, it is better to a degree. my main problem is that since I came off Dianette I stopped sleeping so I tried everything possible, herbal to start with, worked for a few days, then sleeping pills but, didn't make me feel great the next day, groggy, headaches, depression. I then tried Melotonin, didn't work at all. I walk 4kms every day by the sea and I workout regularly, I thought I was doing everything right. before I go on, I am going to tell you that I lost my mother to cancer 4 years ago, still find it hard to accept to be honest, she had breast cancer and then pancreatic cancer and Osteoporosis, I am sharing this so you get the full picture. So I am on the mini pill and trying different drops to make me sleep. Here the docs tried to put me on anti-depressants to help with the menopause but, I am not depressed, just tired and maybe a little down from not sleeping but, I am lucky enough to have the most amazing and supportive husband in the world.  I decided to go to a GN and go on HRT, I went for all the tests and found I had Osteopina (just out of normal) and high chlorestorol. I have been taking Menopace night which stopped the hot flushes but, didn't help with the not sleeping. The GN gave me the full examination and told me my uterus had shrunk. I went on Angeluq just 10 days ago, I worry if all my medications mix. So I take an Omega 3 tablet, a hair vitamin tablet, a calcium tablet, a chlorestorol tablet, Angeliq, Menopace night and sleeping drops, sounds a lot but, the doc says ok as mainly vitamins. The symptoms I get hit a high yesterday, I woke up feeling like I wanted to be sick but, was ok once I had breakfast, I had a runny nose which I put down to an allergy as it came on so quickly but, this is a known side effect. I experienced bad abdominal pains straight away, after 3 days I got an infection and then a bladder infection along with a yeast infection, I have sore breasts, red eyes and generally feel unwell. I didn't take one yesterday. I have now decided to try some natural patches to see if they help but, have to order online from the UK so will take a couple of weeks to get. I tried not taking the drops but, just laid there, I don't think they suit me anymore, they were ok to start with so I am going to take Sleepeze for now but, if anyway can suggest a natural sleep agent that works that would be fab. Obviously my body is yearning progesterone and oestrogen, I am not sure whether I should try another HRT tablet but, in the back of mind, I feel uneasy because of my mother. she had an hysterectomy at 32 and went straight onto HRT it was the thing everyone did in those days, she got breast cancer late 60's and died 79 years. Any advise will be gratefully accepted, thanks 😓 Nobody discusses the menopause here, ladies fight their symptoms in private, I am open, in the south they are terrified of HRT and avoid it but, I want quality of life, in the north, they are more educated on the whole menopause thing so will talk about it and take HRT."

bobbysgirl,2015-05-10T16:49+00:00,Back to square one?,"Hello ladies, I've been dipping in and out of this site for some time now and have found it most reassuring to find I am not alone. I thought the menopause was all hot flushes and mood swings. They don't tell you about everything else, do they? I started with the flushes in 2011. I was helping a friend build a garden around her new home and her builders kept asking about 'the strange woman in the T shirt' - it was March and they were in thermals! It was all downhill from there. I tried sage leaves, black cohosh etc but got no relief. Finally I went to my GP, who knew what was going on, and said I've tried the 'remedies' now I want HRT - Industrial Strength. He prescribed Kliofem 2mg/1mg. It took a couple of weeks for them to start working. Then I felt great! No hot flushes, a full night's sleep, even-tempered (well, for me), far fewer aches and pains, no migraines and I stopped gaining weight (didn't lose any) Terrific!  Then after about 3 months I started getting some breakthrough bleeding. It wasn't much and it wasn't often, but a bit annoying when I thought I had left all that behind. It was then I started getting 'period pains'. My friend (with the garden) is a pharmacist. She said had the doctors mentioned 3 months on and 1 month off with these tablets. I said no But I would try it. I stopped the tablets and the bleeding stopped. I also lost 1/2 Stone in weight! I was just starting to get the odd flush when I started back on the HRT. Within two weeks, the flushing has stopped but the bleeding is back,as is the joint pain, headaches, weight gain, dry skin and a permanent, low-level irritability with EVERYTHING. I feel like I'm back to square one. I should go to see my GP but I have an appointment with the Gynae. Dept. on Thursday. I had Endometriosis for 20 years and found out, more recently, that I have cysts AND fibroids. They have been shrinking on their own. But with my track record I'm glad my GP referred me a while back and I have 6 monthly reviews. I don't want to go down the road of having a hysterectomy . I'm a full-time Carer for my mum and increasingly so for my husband (who has health problems of his own). Also, a very close friend had the operation go horribly wrong and she now wears a colostmy bag. In your collective experience do you think the bleeding is connected to the cysts/fibroids? Would another HRT be better for me (oh please say yes)? Is there anything I should be asking this chap on Thursday?

annajane66,2015-05-25T16:47+00:00,Peri-menopause symptoms but 'not menopausal yet' according to blood test,"I'm so glad to have found this forum! I'm 48 and have been peri-menopausal for about 5 years, and the symptoms have intensified over the past year - night sweats, mood 'disturbances', memory issues and generalised anxiety. I finally found a GP who actually listened and took me seriously, and we had a conversation about HRT. My fear around HRT is the possibility of depression as a side effect of progesterone - I have suffered very heavily from depression in the past, and will be on anti-depressant medication for life.  However, my mood - which had been OK for the most part - is starting to suffer, and I'm having quite bad dips. These may last for a couple of hours or a couple of days or weeks, but they have a definite hormonal 'feel'. The GP sent me for a blood test to establish hormone levels, which has come back 'not menopausal yet' ...  I have made another appointment with this GP, but does anyone know whether 'not menopausal yet' means I am ineligible for HRT? And does anyone have any facts/info re. progesterone and depression? Thanks for reading! Anna."

Just a little spotting and that was it.  I feel exhausted all the time, with severe headaches and very queasy. I don't know whether I should start the other patches or whether I should try to stick it out without HRT. Has anyone else felt so lousy? It's the sickness and headaches that really trouble me.

I have been in peri for years but did not realise; thought it was stress.  However at Christmas I was floored with hot flushes, dizzyness, sickness, shakes and bladder irritation; some leaking also.  I had buzzying in my ears and tingling in my hands!  I also got a UTI!! Sore joints too. I struggled on not knowing what on earth was wrong but then as I had not bleed for ages I kinda wondered and asked Doc for bloods; full meno!!  At least I knew!!!  I then tried some herbals.....no use.  The symptoms continued and after many, many trips to the Docs, many tears, much research I feel maybe now I am beginning to feel better; for now!!!!! I use a mixture of prescription drugs, supplments and alternative therapies. My treatment plan is as follows.  This is obviously very individual to me but it may help some of you or at least give you stuff to consider. Meds. Mirabegron for bladder irritation. HRT Elestte Duet Conti Propanadol for anxiety Supplements Primrose Oil for breast tenderness Magnesium for bladder, nerves and muscles Rose hip for joints Kelp for skin and hair Joint ace for joint health Tumeric for inflammation Probiotic for gut health. Marshmallow root tea for bladder I exercise 4 times per week and have tried acupuncture and recently had a mylo fascia release massage which immediately stopped my night sweats.  I also eat a low acid, low carb high protein diet.  I avoid sugar and processed food and don't drink alcohol or tea or coffee. My bladder is improved after a flare up and possible UTI.  I still get a bit hot in bed but it does not wake me up.  Hands a bit numb in the morning.  Joints can be a bit sore but much better than before.  My anxiety has been terrible but settling down.  At times I have really felt I was going mad and I may do again but I do feel I am getting a grip on this rather than it controlling me.  I enjoy the immediate present and try not to think about the future in terms of the meno; I don't know what it may bring.  This thing goes up and down....my belief is to try and take control and don't be afraid to try things and to KEEP asking for help!!!  I am not perfect and foolishly had some wine a couple of weeks ago which led to a bladder flare, dreadful anxiety and possible UTI.  You live and learn though.  This site has really helped too and I wanted to give a bit back.  Sorry for long post but there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Here's to us ALL having some peace at least for a while.XXXXX"

This is a new one for me, i am not an over eater, and have a good weight, and diet ( not over weight) so lucky that way having had a long 10 year natural peri menopause and now being 19 months post menopause .( and aged almost 51) also my body is so fatigued, and i ache and need to sit down far more these days.

How Adrenals Can Wreak Havoc » Symptoms of low cortisol Symptoms of low cortisol Although adrenal issues may also point to high cortisol, low cortisol, or often a combination of both.

Very up and down from the start. Pattern of symptoms still the same. Very low during withdrawal bleed followed by 2 good weeks then awful mood swings and low level anxiety. I started on Estradot 25mg patch with seperate progesterone. But my consultant has just increased my dose to 50mg patch as she thinks I am too young (only 44) to get by with just 25mg. I am feeling on edge with under lying anxiety. Been on increased dose for 2 days. I am not taking the progesterone this month to avoid a withdrawal bleed when we go away next week. My consultant suggested I do this. She said to just start the Utro when we get back. So I am on day 21 of my cycle just wearing a higher dose patch but feeling far from 'right' inside.

jowanders,2014-12-07T04:51+00:00,Femoston?,"Hi I have been on Diane35 for several years and feel it is time to change. Menopause is very late in our family - my mother had a miscarriage when she was 58 -. I am on the Diane35 because I lost so much hair and also none of the other pills agreed with me. The hairloss has been stabilised. So I am naturally a bit anxious about changing. So I like to prepare as much as I can.  It has been suggested to me that I try Femoston 2/10 (HRT) as  it will slowly stop the bleedings, whilst still giving you homones. I know it is not an ACP but  I don't need that. I just need the homones for my hair. However I read that Femoston 2/10 can only be taken if you haven't had your periods for 6 months. This is not the case with me. Still have them. Is there anyone out there that recently has been on Femoston or even any other HRT following the pill?"

mrspinkrat,2014-09-21T17:37+00:00,"Is this the menopause- tinnitus, bitter taste, intermittent periods and hypothyroidism?!?!","It's a fairly long story but I need help and advice please ladies as I'm in a bit of a state..... It all began last August 2013 when I went to the GP with internal tremors and intermittent periods. After having bloods checked I was told that I was hypothyoid and started on 50mcg of levothyroxine. My periods were coming once every 3/4 months. My last period was in March of this year. I had my FSH tested and the first time was high but was retested and told it was normal. While all this has been going on I developed a very weird and quite distressing bitter taste in my mouth (last November). I tried all sorts to eliminate it from mouthwash to totally changing my diet etc.... I added in multivits and B12 and by May time this year it seemed to have faded..... To be replaced by tinnitus!! Once again, I've been thoroughly checked (including an MRI) but no cause has been found and I'm told to learn to live with it.... What I'm wondering is....am I in the menopause and if so, are these symptoms connected? Apart from missing periods, I have no other menopausal symptoms such as sweats/flushes etc.. I feel at a loss as to what to do next?? Oh, I also have a vit D deficiency but the GP just told me to get out in the sun more.... Click here to view image The tinnitus scares me when I think I've got to live with this for the rest of my life :'( I'm only 44 btw. I think that's everything but I might have missed something! I increased my levithyroxine to 75mcg a couple of months ago as it was thought my TSH was still a little high. It is now 1.2 Thank you xxx"

Since then, I've been reading (and occasionally replying) all the posts but am so overwhelmed with all these ailments! I had no idea menopause could cause so many illnesses and mental health issues. I'm 57 and still have occasionally periods but presume I must be in peri? It's quite frightening to read some of your stories/posts and how your bodies are changing. I do suffer from anxiety and insomnia but some of that has been due to marriage and family issues, so tricky to single out if peri? I've recdntly changed around my vits supplements and am feeling better. I take a Menopace night and 200mg magnesium at night and seem to have slightly more restful sleeps and don't wake up feeling heady. I do still get down or anxious days but that's probably just Life! I also take omega 3 and starflower at breakfast. The more posts I read, the more scared I become of turning into another person. Some of the medication you quote, I have to google as have no idea what it is! Surely some women just sail through this change and it's just those with bad experiences that write on here?

I have 3 other friends all the same age in various different stages of peri-menopause/menopause which in a lot of ways is re assuring as can speak to them about it.  My periods have always been every 5 weeks thereabouts since i was 14, 3 years ago it all started to change.  I then went to 28 days like clockwork.  I have always suffered from quite bad PMT/PMS but when i have been to the doctors I have always felt they never seemed to take it seriously and listen to me about how i was feeling.  I have read all the posts on here and i feel exactly the same, one day ok, the next extremely anxious, weepy, forgettful, unattractive (not characters of snow white)! however they are all marching along side me.  This month i developed an eye infection i went to the doctors 4 times, eventually with her referring me as i was continuously getting an infection.  That day i felt slightly edgy, she took my blood pressure and not suprisingly it was high.  The next day i had another period, after 16 days from the last one!! i was then on for 10 days!.  I know its all changing. I have been to the doctors again and had to the 24 hour blood pressure thing and an ecg.  All this is compouding my worry and anxiety, now making me feel with the high blood pressure more anxious! I do not know what would be right for me, i am trying to eat healthy and excercise (have dog) so out every day).  I am thinking that i might be desperate enough for HRT although my head is really scared with the media reports about it causing cancer, the other alternative anti-depressents, all i know is that i cannot go on feeling like this."

Click here to view image Which, when you think of it, isn't far off the truth.  In our younger years I think our bodies are always expecting us to have conceived each month - that's evolution for you. Someone just forgot to tell the ol' birds that they needn't bother!  Still, not all bad:  the house has been cleaned from top to bottom; the gardens have been tended (and no backache, thanks I believe to my NBBF Menopace Original!) so I'm going to sit and wait to see what Thursday (Day 28!) holds for me!! Truth is, although I generally always have a very disrupted sleep (tossing and turning, up & down to the loo etc), I'm very rarely tired during the day.  Until next week that is, when I'm sure I'll feel like I've been kicked all around the  show for a day or so!! Do you think I should count my blessings, shut my gob, and make the most of it?  Just wondering if anyone else feels like that once in a while. I'm hoping a load of you come firing back at me with replies like:            ""Yeah, you get like that when you finally stop bleeding""         ""Yeah, that when you know you're over the worse of ALL the      horrible Peri symptoms....and its plain sailing from now on in"" Sx"

I kind of had to suggest the cream to my Dr as she was suggesting, bladder training and vesicare, I use vaginal cones pelvic floor, and tried vesicare but not happy as it can cause dry eyes, which I have problems with already! She did say she wasn't sure the cream could help with bladder, frequency, urgency. I understand from what I have read the estriol when applied topically, doesn't carry risks associated with oral HRT. My questions are, has anyone had success using estriol for bladder frequency issues? Just looking for reassurance that this cream might help, before I start using it later.

I have learned very recently that my blood pressure medication Cozar is responsible for my weight gain and puffiness that I blamed on peri. Also, its really important that we realize that yes Peri causes a lot of problems, but its also good to get checked out because everything is not related to peri. However, I suspect my joint pain is due to peri, but, I am still getting it investigated just to make sure.  My joint pain/swelling started right at the same time that peri started.

THough I did have my usual cramps. Now it's a new month and my period is supposed to start in 5 days (I don't know how accurate that is because I use a period tracker app) and I haven't felt the breast soreness/tenderness that I usually get a week before my period starts. Does this mean that I won't get my period this month AT ALL? Or could it be that my cycle is deciding to change and my period will come on later on in the month? Thanks."

When I squeeze it, some puss type of stuff comes out, which is slightly darker than when I squeeze the other breast. I breast fed my kids and had mastitus and it kind of reminds me of that. I remember my mum had something similar at this stage of her life and I remember she showed me a mass on the surface of her boob, which turned out to be nothing. When breastfeeding, I used to put hot flannels on my boobs to ease the discomfort. Perhaps I should do the same now. General info: I'm 48 and have been experiencing peri symptoms for some time now. My periods are spacing out and becoming lighter so hoping I'm on the final stretch.  Can't wait for my 50s !!  Hope this finds all you ladies in good peri health, as well as can be expected anyway. Thoughts and advice always appreciated xxx"

Madmarilyn,2015-04-12T19:12+00:00,Becoming someone else - someone really stupid?,"Hello Ladies! I am 51, and think I am turning into another person, doing stupid things and making daft mistakes. It's affecting my relationship as my partner says I can't be trusted, and that they wouldn't be able to rely on me in a crisis, and it's true.  I have left keys in the front door, or worse, and seem to be unable to do things right anymore. I have left the gas on, and forgotten parts of a meal, or poured alcoholic drinks for everyone at dinner parties when my partner has been teetotal for four years. It's as though my brain has switched off.  I have had irregular periods for about a year and the last one was at the end of December. I am lucky that I don't get hot flushes yet, but can break out into a cold sweat when I realise I have yet again done something crazy. I found this site first as a result of the posts on aching joints, but I don't understand how I have become so stupid. It's not just that I am forgetful - even with a list I can forget to bring everything back. If I mean to do something I remember whilst cleaning my teeth, by the time I finish I have forgotten all about it. I make bad decisions, I have lost confidence in driving, I can tune out during a conversation and say something stupid, I can put the washing on the wrong cycle and just not understand the point someone is making at work. Sometimes I try t make a point and just lose my train of thought, when I used to be quite eloquent.  I was a confident woman who held down a responsible job, and now I sometimes don't recognise myself. I can be driving somewhere and then forget the place we discussed going to five minute earlier and drive past it. I find I lose concentration really easily. If it wasn't affecting my relationship so badly I wouldn't be so worried - and my dad had Alzheimer's which makes me worry that I will be next. Any suggests to get my brain back on track?"
angie31022,2015-04-06T00:43+00:00,what are your thoughts,I'm 51 I've not had a period since September 2013.  Yesterday I feld like i had a discharge.  when I check myself I had a clear discharge and found red blood.  I said what is this my period after all this time.  About a week ago I was experiencing very sore breast but i do have cysts and my breast alway swelled and were sore before a period onset.  I thought maybe it was due to purchasing two new bra's but it was not that at all.  Although I'm not flooding it appear to be my normal monthly cycle with no pain. Last I had a bad case of hot flashes and night sweat for about 6 months that just stop on my 1 year anniversary of no periods.   I too hate going to doctors I had to be put to sleep for my colon check last year.  I'm going to the doctor and letting her know she is a good doctor.  I dont know if gaining 20 pound and being stressed cause this or not.   I must say I've enjoyed reading your experiences its calm me down a lot.

manuela67667,2015-04-03T01:55+00:00,Peri- needing to whinge! Up and down even trying HRT,"Click here to view image It's been nearly a month since I've been on here, I didn't feel too bad up to two weeks ago as I started with and AD on the 29.1 and two weeks later aded HRT Femoston Conti 1/ 5mg to it. By March I suddently feelt a bit better, still small hick ups but not AS bad...Until about 10 days before the anticipated break of HRT (I got prescribed a contineous one even though I'm not 1 year without bleeding, but have gotten PMS so my Doc decided to have Oestrogen and Prog. daily and then do a 4 days break for bleed and restart again). I started to feel down the dumps again, weird thoughts, sluggish, like bit in la la land not quite here etc. Then stopped the HRT got my bleed and yes no improvment. Soooo I started Femoston 2/10 because I felt that the break is not doing me any good at all and the Prog part probably with 5 mg was too low... Click here to view image I used to be really bad in November- January so I had to do something. I am 41 years old, and my FSH was postmenopausal already 2 years ago. I used to be on Lexapro AD for Anxiety (obviously didnt make the connectiong between Peri and Anxiety as by that time I didnt even knew I was peri or that a FSH of 110 is postmeno (i started to skip periods then). Last year June even though on Lexapro I totally ""lost"" the plot, as in couldnt think straight, confused, cotton wool brain etc so I thought thats it, its Lexapro's fault and I weaned myself off it. Then was without for a few months in which of course things didnt get any better. It ended up me being nearly agrophobic, not wanting to leave the house, waking up each morning at 5 am with heart racing and weird thinking, not able to go back to sleep. Hot and cold sensations, feeling feverish etc. Being self employed it started to affect my business as yes I really couldnt do work like that. I was in the ER once that time as I had 3 days straight very bad heart palpations and they asked if I was on HRT? Nope... So during that time it dawned to me that I am actually perimenopausal and not that early into it either, we did a few blood tests and my Prog was down to 1, my Estrogen gone by November down to 80. Although in December it jumped up as my Ovaries found some sort of half decent follicle again. Anyhows I think, supsect that after my good period I had in March (before that I had just light ones)  my Estrogen is on the downer again hence I might feel that spacey, crapey? I am a bit at loss now, should I up the AD (Paxil, 20 mg atm), should I stay on Femoston 2/10 for a few months, should I go back to Femston Conti 1/5 where I have the prog part daily? I think my Prog. is a problem for me personally, as I remember during pregnancy I felt the best I ever have (they say thats when you have lots of progesterone) and once I needed a pill after, which is high Progesterone too, and I feelt great on that! - so perhaps I do need Progesterone on a continueous basis, but more than the 5 mg of the Conti, and not 10 mg just for 14 days....

I am still going through menopause but found out the most dibiliating of symptoms I thought were related to menopause (joint pain, stiffness, weakness and crushing exhaustion) were actually being caused by Rheumatoid Arthritis, an autoimmune disorder.  Not that those symptoms cannot be caused by Menopause -- they can, do  and are for some!  But mine was getting progressively worse and starting to cause like a ""mummy"" effect where I couldnt' really move when I reached the worst state.  Finally, the docs ran the right tests and found not only do I have RA, it is in an advanced state and aggressive.  Good news is they are treating it quickly and I am at home on disability now, no longer pushing pushing pushing to go-go-go commuting, working, shopping, cooking, cleaning.  It's all calm now.  I am preparing for treatment with many vaccines then starting Humira on 4/14 (it is an immune suppressant so I have to get 2 flu, pnemonia, shingles, TB, and Heb B vaccinnations, some of which are a series given over time).

Shazanne,2015-04-07T05:40+00:00,Would Really Value Opinions,"Hi. I have posted a couple of time before and always found people advice really helpful. I was on Livial for a few years until my gyne took me off it six weeks ago after an incident of spotting. He wanted to see how I'd do without it. I thought initially that I was fine - but now I have a mix of issues and would really value peoples opinion on what is going on. I am 53 and menopause symptoms started about 6-7 years ago. Firstly, on a positive note, I think my overall mood has improved without the Livial. When I was on it, I often noticed that at the same time very month my mood was really low and I was irritable and depressed. I thought perhaps the Livial wasn't strong enough but I continued to take it as I had no other menopause symptoms. Two weeks after stopping it I noticed I became really tired, had some sweating (during the day)and felt nausea for a day or two. I assumed it was because I had stopped the Livial 'cold turkey' and that my hormones had dropped so I did nothing about it. I returned to my gyne for a scheduled consultation to see how I was doing and he prescribed Givigel (oestrogen) and Prometrium (progesteron) to replace the Livial and prevent menopause symptoms as he had checked my uterine lining and it was fine and I am not considered at risk for taking HRT (no health problems or family history concerns). I decided not to take it though until I saw how I would manage without it. I thought I was doing brilliantly until this past weekend - exactly a month after the last episode - when the nausea, sweating and tiredness returned with a bang and is worse that it was last month! It almost like pregnancy nausea- I am not vomiting but have no appetite and can't tolerate the smell of food!!! Is this normal??? I missed work today as I was afraid of feeling sick, especially at lunch time when other people were eating. Does anyone else feel like this or have symptoms that reoccur on a monthly basis? Is this even a menopause symptom?"

liz1234,2015-04-06T18:27+00:00,Peri Menopause or not?,"Hi My periods have been irregular for about 6 months or so now. I have not had any flushes as far as I know (and I am sure I would know!). Then in February I missed a period and my anxiety started and depression. I had come off an anti depressant end of last year so Doctor put me back on it and said it could be withdrawal from that and menopause. My anxiety and depression are there most days, I am signed off sick from work as I can't cope. As the anxiety and depression is still there my doctor has started me on HRT to try and level out the hormones but I am doubting that it is even menopause to be honest. I am totally confused but just wish I could get my life back. My Mum had what was called a nervous breakdown in her early 50's, which was obviously her menopause, I am 53. Any ideas would be appreciated! Thanks"

Anything dealing with cancer is scary to me. I never was like this before, I had a rational approach.

Is my Peri Honeymoon Over?,"Hi Girls I know I've been on here, bleating on about braving all this Peri mullarkey with just the help of my good friend Menopace Original and the occasional bit of bioidentical Progesterone Cream. But I'm beginning to wonder if I'm finally joining the Peri Club as a fully paid up member now........now that I'm getting a bit sweaty?? Since I started taking the above bits on 1st Jan, I've felt really good: both mentally and physically.  Click here to view image (Apologies in advance for being graphic/detailed: but I feel I'm in safe hands on this forum, so here goes...) On Thursday, my Day 28 I had stopped applying the P'Cream. Instantly had a little watery, pink discharge (very light).  Friday my good friend 'Brown Sludge' returned: nothing major, but not what I wanted.  I have mentioned it before, but I find the 'smell' of this discharge really awful, and although I shower, keep myself clean, change almost within the hour sometimes, I can still 'smell' myself.  Click here to view image Friday night I felt the Red Mist creeping up:  no cramps, no aches etc. Felt a bit moany, like I had to pass comment about everyone and everything (does that ring a bell with anyone?) and I went to bed, quite tired. Saturday morning Brown Sludge was still visiting me. My lovely 6yr old grandson was staying over and jumped into bed with me with his Tablet. He was only in with me briefly as he was going out early.  But in that short time I went into what I now know was my Melt Down.  All caused, would you believe, by the two Irish voices, chattering inanely throughout my grandson's Minecraft game!!!  Boy, I know teenagers now use the term 'chatting sh*t', but I truly think this best describes the ridiculous 'banter' all though that stupid, irritating game (I hate games, Facebook, Twitter et al: can't stand it, but that's just the 'normal' me!!). It gave me such the hump that I saw it as an opportunity to go off on one.  My poor son had to listen to me venting my spleen about someone we know well, all the time I wanted to burst into anger tears but held back.  That boy of mine is such a bloody Diplomat:  women will love him always!! I sorta came round, and left all my boys downstairs, taking myself, and my ironing upstairs to do a massive backlog of ironing - for 2hrs!!  I must have been on auto pilot as I survived 'watching' 2 back episodes of TOWIE in amongst it all!  By the time I came down, I had calmed right down, started to see the transition from Brown Sludge into a proper bleed, and began to turn that corner. First things first, I apologised to my son.  He just thinks I'm nutty. Full Stop. My ol' man just acknowledged that I was tired and  hadn't usually been like that, and I didn't eat too much after about 3pm.  Click here to view image When I came downstairs, however, although I was in a really bright mood (and still am) I had the terrible shakes - almost llike I'd imagine a Diabetic to feel with low blood sugar.  So I grabbed a piece of chocolate (much to my son's amusement!), had a drink, took my Menopace, had a sarnie, then felt so much better, and settled.  Honestly, I know there was a banana there that I should have eaten, but I just took the easy option! I think I'll start to work with the premise of 'little and often' this week foodwise, to avoid that again, as I also felt  sweaty.  First thought: 'Oh Gawd.  here they come!!!'.  But I'm hoping its tied in with the silly eating pattern I'd adopted and coming on this weekend?? I haven't ruled out HRT, and will do what I can with other remedies to ward off/control the hot flushes, but I do wonder if things are a-changing for me, and that my 'honeymoon' is well and truly over? Oh, and the other thing: my aching joints are REALLY aching: left shoulder and left elbow again.  But I'm going to monitor them to see if they were worse just in the build-up to bleeding.  If so, I'll learn to cope with that, as half of me actually believes that all the time I'm bleeding, I'll be feeling OK. The other half can't wait for them to become irregular/stop.  Who knows what's best until it happens?  And then no doubt I'll be wanting them back! Click here to view image Any thoughts ladies?

A recent one is my craving for salt - has anyone else experienced new cravings since becoming peri- or menopausal?? I've never been pregnant so have no idea what it would be like to have cravings of the type pregnant women get. In the last few months I've developed a strange craving for salt!! I've never in my life had salt on my chips, only lashings of vinegar. But relatively recently, I now suffer from a dire craving to put salt on my fries or my chips. Never crave salt on/in anything else, it's just chips! I never eat ready meals and rarely eat crisps, so I don't know if this is the result of some kind of salt deficiency in my diet or if it's connected to menopause? I don't need to add salt to any other foods - it is only chips!! Has anyone else ever experienced the onset of cravings similarly?? (Funny enough, this bothers me almost more than other menopausal symptoms would do, as I know it isn't healthy to be shaking salt on my fries 5 or 6 days a week, and I am hoping this isn't going to be a lifelong habit.) I have also noticed that in the past two or three years my desire for chocolate has also increased. It's not quite a craving in the same way as the salted chips, but whereas I was always a chocoholic anyway, more recently I am realising that it's as if I don't have an ""off"" button where chocolate is concerned! And it has to be certain chocolate. Just any old choc won't do; has to be 70% cocoa or more, or otherwise something with peanut butter (not, peanuts!) in the middle."

jayneejay,2015-03-26T01:22+00:00,Peri / Post Meno Vitamin Regime info,"Info that may help some ladies Ten Tips To Getting Through Menopause Written by E. Conrad Hicks, Jr., M.D. and Valerie Otto The generation of women entering menopause is healthier, feels younger than their years, and lead more active lives and careers than previous generations. However, there is also no doubt that for many women, this can be an uncomfortable and confusing time- plagued with hot flashes, irritability, headaches, depression, sleepless nights, and fatigue, as well as waning libido and decreased ability to enjoy sex. Following are ten important suggestions to help you embrace rather than dread this time in your life. 1. There’s no reason to suffer If you are a woman, most likely you will spend a third of your life peri-menopausal or post-menopausal. Considering how much you’ve been through in your life, there is no reason to “tough out” the discomforts of menopause. Americans think it is normal and responsible to take various medicines for arthritis pain, cardiac and vascular disease, and diabetes. So why not also evaluate and/or treat the symptoms and changes that come with menopause? There are plenty of options available now besides hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and physicians are now embracing integrated medicine to accomplish what works best for each individual woman, whether it includes HRT or not. One of the newer products they are recommending is Oöna, an herbal supplement that combines black cohosh and chaste tree berry. 2. There is no “right” way, just “your” way You may believe that HRT is either the “fountain of youth” or the “fountain of evil.” Truthfully, it’s neither. Become informed about all the options available and consult your doctor. With an open mind and effective communication, you and your doctor will find what works best for you. There are several integrated approaches including conventional pharmaceutical preparations, herbs, acupuncture, and meditation, etc. that many women have had success with. 3. Update your vitamin regime If you have been taking the same multivitamin for years, now is the time to review the label. Women in midlife have different needs and should take at least 400 IUs of vitamin E (take these in 200 IU intervals), 400 mcg of folic acid, 100 mg of vitamin B6, 1250-1500 mg of calcium with 500 mg of magnesium, 200-1200 IUs of vitamin D, and 1,000-5000 mg of vitamin C with Rose Hips. Omega 3 essential fatty acids are also very important and can be found in cod liver oil pills and flaxseed. 4. Hormones are affected by stress and what we eat As production of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone by the ovaries declines, the adrenal glands, muscles and brain begin to produce an increasing percentage of the body’s androgen hormones and convert them to weaker estrogens. A healthy diet and positive attitude have been shown to help this conversion. Also, symptoms of menopause are known to have “triggers” such as alcohol, caffeine, sugar and spicy foods, which you should eliminate or cut back on. Starches should come from darker whole breads, grains and vegetables. It’s also a good idea to eliminate, or deal with, as much stress as possible since most women feel either a greater number of menopausal symptoms or feel them with greater intensity when they are under stress. 5. There is usually more than a hormonal shift Often there is an accompanying emotional shift. As Christiane Northrup, M.D. points out; it is characteristic of women to focus much of their energy during the child-bearing years on caring for others. As they move toward menopause, the focus commonly turns inwards to caring for themselves. Women often re-evaluate their lives and their relationships, looking for the understanding, support and the encouragement they feel they’ve been giving others for so many years. Make sure that you are not asking someone to read your mind, but rather take care in how you express yourself. If need be, consult a therapist. 6. Diet, making the best of the four-letter word You may feel that your eating habits have not changed or that you’re even eating less, but find yourself gaining weight. In mid-life women experience a 10-15% metabolic rate slowdown, their bodies become more efficient at storing energy as fat, and as estrogen levels fall, appetite increases. After menopause this weight usually goes away as metabolism re-stabilizes, but in the meantime, keeping blood sugar level during the day by eating small meals tends to help most menopausal women. The key is not to overeat at night as metabolism peaks earlier in the day, and to cut down on carbohydrates, and have protein with each meal. 7. Exercise makes every list Regular aerobic exercise can help ease menopausal symptoms, maintain or optimize heart heath and maintain metabolic rate. A program of weight or resistance training will help maintain bone strength. There are so many different ways to exercise nowadays; from tai-chi to spin, the key is to find one or two that you enjoy. 8. Hormones and the Libido A deficiency in estrogen or progesterone can cause changes such as vaginal dryness and thinning of the vaginal wall, making sex less pleasurable and even painful. Testosterone levels also fall during the menopausal transition and can contribute to a decreased sex drive, decreased energy and a decreased “overall sense of well-being.” Most physicians will prescribe an estriol cream for the vaginal dryness and thinning of the wall. Similarly if low testosterone levels are detected, supplementation to normal levels is easy to achieve. Additionally, the combination of the herbs black cohosh and chaste tree berry found in Oöna will also help with vaginal dryness and thinning vaginal walls. 9. You can keep your skin radiant First, if you smoke, here’s another reason to quit. Smoking damages your skin and most smokers see wrinkles earlier in life. (Smokers will also enter menopause earlier.) Make sure you use a face cleanser that is cream based, since soap or gel cleansers tend to dry out middle-age skin. Exfoliate once a week and mask once a week (not on the same day). Finally, supplement with omega 3 fats like flaxseed oil, cod liver oil and/or primrose oil. Vitamins C and E are also very important, as is coenzyme Q10. Water and fiber are also very important for your skin and body. 10. Keeping your mind sharp and heart strong The more the link between estrogen and cardiovascular disease is investigated, the more apparent it becomes that the cardiovascular protection estrogen has been thought to offer may not apply to everyone, and in fact, should not be given to women with a history of cardiovascular disease. As for the mind, it is difficult to determine if a woman’s feelings of “scatteredness and forgetfulness” are caused by hormones as opposed to stress or aging. It is still unknown whether there is any connection between estrogen and Alzheimer’s, but it does appear that a minimum amount of estrogens are essential for certain memory functions. Also, good health habits have been tied to improved memory function. Eat at least 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day, supplement with B-vitamins, E and zinc, and get plenty of antioxidants such as vitamin C. Ginkgo Biloba can also help, but it’s important to choose a reliable brand and look for standardized extracts. Whether you are symptomatic or not, menopause is a great reminder to take a serious look at your health. As modern medicine has now extended our life span to almost twice what it used to be, our bodies undergo profound physiologic changes. The importance of the mind-body connection cannot be underestimated, and choosing to deal with what ails you is a big first step. Find an approach to menopausal symptoms that you are comfortable with and works for you, and you can begin to spend this time focusing on the positive aspects of this transitional time, instead of suffering unnecessarily. This is an opportunity to make adjustments that could ensure that the years to come are most enjoyable. You’ve earned it."

sharcerv52408,2015-03-27T13:11+00:00,Decisions.. Decisions,"Hi al! I told my GYN that lately when I ovulate I experience pain. So she immediately ordered an ultrasound which I had on March 17th. The results showed that I had multiple fibroids in my uterus. When I went back for my follow up I told my doctor I wanted a hysterectomy. He said that my fibroids aren't very large and for someone my age they don't really recommend a hysterectomy as a first line of treatment. He recommended a hormonal treatment i.e., birth control. His first recommendation was the Mirena implant. I don't like the idea of anything being inserted because I have heard how much complications those types of things can cause. He also mentioned getting the depo shot or Lupron shot. But the only way I would be a candidate for the Lupron shots was if I was indeed going through perimenopause. So he drew some blood to test my LH and FSH. I got the results back from that yesterday which were all within normal limits. When I go back to see him I'm going to ask him if I can just get on the mini pill. I know he may try to insist on the Mirena implant but the only thing that will do is stop the heavy bleeding it doesn't really address the issues of the fibroids themselves. I don't want to do a depo shot because all the side effects that are associated with it. So I figured the least problematic form of treatment for me would be the mini pill."

(& actually no joke) So.... bloating, mood swings, aching joints, insomnia, itching, memory loss, headaches, spots, dry skin, constipation, diahorrea, thinning hair, exhaustion, thyroid fluctuations, painful bones, itchy boobs, loss of bladder control, bladder irritation, diffficulty concentrating, panic attacks, palpitations, racing heart, uncontrollable tremors, twitches & spasms, anxiety, fear, dread, depression, suicidal thoughts, mania, confusion, acid reflux, lump in throat, difficulty swallowing, sore tongue, hot flushes, feeling cold, nausea, vertigo, swimming head, blurred dimmed vision, unable to get the right word, fuzzy detatched feeling in head, faintness, off-balance, sinus/ear trouble, weight loss, chest pains/heaviness, difficulty breathing, strong body odour, painful tight neck/jaw, clenching teeth, irregular/missed periods, flooding, clotting, spotting, food allergies, tingling/dead extremities, bad dreams, stomach/gut pain, low immune system, anger, over-emotional, memory flashbacks, dry painful eyes, sagging skin, loss of elasticity, loss of muscle, eye bags, grey hair, wrinkling.

And you are not alone. I can cook & do housework again, and am eating bacon & eggs every morning, something I've never done haha!  I know I'm not out of the woods yet, & I do have my crashes, (still can't go out on my own because of the swimmy, disconnected feeling) & this could go on for a while but I have lots of hope, we all go through this change, some worse than others, but we do come out the other side, & stronger!! As for reccommending remedies, we are all different. hrt works for many, I havn't used it yet, anti-depressants work for some, haven't used those either (yet!) the beta blockers, anti-reflux, st john's wort made me worse. Couldn't stomach the B complex, or menopace, (think it was the iodine, made anxiety & heart racing worse!). So just taking oil of evening primrose & starflower, cod liver oil, vitamin D (from the docs) & paracetemol.  Gave up coffee, chocolate, sugar, dairy, was already gluten-free. Using organic soya milk, flax, sweet potatoes (for phyto estrogens). Going to get some magnesium and calcium too.  I hope this is helpful to someone, I know I was helped by ladies on this forum when I was desperate xxxxxxx"

alfie55097,2015-03-25T11:39+00:00,husband raising the issue - good or bad idea?,"My wife, aged 37, has changed a lot in the last couple of years, the main symptom being increased anxiety levels. The timing and nature of the symptoms are very like PMS, but their duration and severity are incomparably worse than used to be the case. As a squeamish husband i do my best to stay clear of such details, but her recent purchasing patterns are suggestive to me of heavier, worse, whatever, menstruation. I've recently started to surmise that she's in the early stages of menopause. She's youngish but not ridiculously so, plus the symptoms are there and I wonder if there mightn't be a link with complications during (successful) IVF treatment 4 years ago which led to her losing an ovary. The idea that she might be in the early stages of menopause came to me quite recently, when I stumbled across the shopping bag full of super-ultra-heavy duty sanitary products that she didn't ever used to need, as far as I know. Prior to that I'd been tending towards a view that she'd somehow picked up some kind of standalone anxiety disorder. In many ways i'd be really pleased if the problem was something with a finite time horizon, because the prospect of living with her as she is now for another 40 years or whatever was starting to feel quite unrealiatic. There are a few genuine issues in our compatability as a couple, not helped by her having a stressful job and shouldering more of the burden at home, but there's just something about the way she is that seems, well, it's so like a bad case of PMS, so irrational, panicky, and so on, that it seems like there's more to it. At its heart I suppose my question is quite a simple one - as a husband would it be sensible for me to bring this up as a discussion topic with her? What would be the best way to do this?"
marie90939,2015-03-19T10:18+00:00,Very worried - anyone any experience of gynae procedures?,"Hi, I have been reading (and posting) on here for a couple weeks or more and had become very reassured by others' experiences. I am now, however, shaking like a leaf because I have just been to see my GP - expecting him to reassure me also that it's nothing to worry about at this stage - and he looked extremely worried and has referred me to a gynae, saying that it will need looking into within the next two weeks. In short: I hadn't had a period since 28th June 2011 until about  3-4 weeks ago when I had the preamble - clear discharge followed a few days later by sore breasts, followed a week later by a couple days of very slight pinkish bleeding. Before the one in 2011, I hadn't had a period for a year. Before which time, they had been extremely heavy for a few years. What has freaked me out is that the doctor seemed to think this was very urgent, and says ""in these cases"" they would want to see me within two weeks. He is referring me today to the gynae and says that they may want to have me into hospital to do tests under anaesthetic! I asked him if this would be general or local, and he said I would need to discuss this with the gynae. I am almost in tears :''(  I am terrified. I have never in my life spent time in hospital and I have never before had a general anaesthetic and am terrified of this. When I was 8, I had a lot of teeth out under gas and ever since I am terrified of being put to sleep. Does anyone have any experiences of gynae involvement and what tests they might do, and how invasive they are? both in terms of literally invasive and of types of anaesthetic hat can be used. I do know/feel sure that I have fibroids but have never actually had this diagnosed, because of the same fear of hospital procedures - as soon as I knew that it would involve putting on a hospital gown and being poked around in some way, I didn't pursue investigating this via the doctor. Another thing I haven't yet mentioned on this forum - and had to mention to the doctor, which might be why he freaked out and treated this so severely - is that I have never in my life had a successful smear test. Every time they attempted one on me, years ago, I would tense completely and seize up (it's psychological, not physical) and they were unable to get deep enough to get a good scraping. The only time they managed to get any scraping, they came back to me with the result that it wasn't enough sample to get a good testing and they would need to repeat the smear test. And I bottled out of course at that point, having pushed myself beyond my limit to try to relax enough for them to get that sample. It was like I had made my supreme effort and it still wasn't enough... The doctor today said that in view of this history of being unable to relax in order to have a successful smear test, this is why he is referring me forthwith to the gynae and why he said they might recommend going into hospital and having anaesthetic!!!! I had hoped that he might have a better solution as to how I could be relaxed enough for them to do a smear, but such a solution was not forthcoming today. I don't know what to do because I simply cannot bottle out this time, as he seemed to think it was urgent as it might possibly be serious (he said it ""might be a problem with the cervix"") but I can't explain how terrified I am about the hospital involvement of this. I don't have any option but to go ahead and see this gynae. But does anyone have similar experiences who can tell me more of what I might expect to happen next? or suggest what I might ask the gynae to do or not do, in the way of tests etc?"
Mo333jo,2015-03-24T12:13+00:00,HRT or not?,"iv been suffering with peri for at least 4 years and I have only just had my 44th birthday. Originally it started with low energy missed periods, and feeling low, but about 2 years ago it was getting worse with joint pain, foggy head, exhaustion, nausea, sinus and ear pain, tinnitus and dizziness. Since last November the UTI feelings, needing to pee, empty bowels and acid  reflux and IBS has kicked in. The Dr did diagnose ME and Fibro last year, but after reading some of the discussions on here I think it is more Peri symptoms. Anyway after all that my dr has recommended that I try HRT as I am very young to be without oestrogen and it will make me feel better. I have been trying the natural reute which helps with the hot flushes, night sweats and disturbed sleep. Has anyone here had a good result using HRT?"

justlease,2015-02-23T03:48+00:00,Miserable symptoms dramatically improved,"Hello everyone.  I've been reading these forums for quite some time, and finally have decided to write a post of my own.  I'm 45, and have been suffering from many typical peri symptoms for a couple of years.  Hot flashes, aches in my shoulders & lower back, heart palpitations, exhaustion, brain fog, insomnia, and terrible daily anxiety worrying I may be having a heart attack or some terrible illness!  After speaking with my Mum and finding out that she experienced much of the same at my age, I began doing research to find out what steps I could take to get all this under control and feel better.  HRT is not an option due to cancer in my family, so  I'd tried black cohosh and then Estroven maximum strength, but neither did much for me to abate any of the symptoms. I think I must have a soy issue because I seemed to have even more of the worrying heart palps when taking the Estroven which does contain soy. Eventually I heard about a magnesium citrate powder you drink at night before bed.  No more insomnia!  I couldn't believe I was finally getting good night's sleep again, and around the same time I started this I noticed that the heart palpitations & anxiety dramatically decreased as well.  Magnesium is amazing stuff.  I don't think I've ever slept this well in my adult life.  No kidding.  (And it doesn't hurt that it keeps you 'regular' too.) Feeling encouraged by the success of the magnesium, I also began taking a B Complex boost, containing B12, B6, biotin and folic acid and that helped with the lightheadedness and lack of energy.  I no longer feel so drained and exhausted and foggy in my head.  I added a liquid iron supplement and vit c as well, and at this point, I feel about 95% better.  I still get the occasional hot flash, but they are very short and no longer accompanied by that terrible feeling of doom and gloom with my heart beating wildly out of my chest.  I thought at first that it was probably just an anomaly -- that feeling pretty good was related to what was going on with my hormones at that particular time of the month, but it's been several months now on this regimen and I do believe that with the help of this forum (and lots of internet research) I've found something that works for me, for now.  I want to thank all you lovely ladies for sharing your stories and advice!  It's such a relief to know we're not suffering alone, and that there is an end to all of this awful stuff--eventually."

I went to have a drug test this past week for a job and I notice my urine was a bit on the dark side which its normally not,but what freaked me out a little is what was floating in my urine.

Shazanne,2015-03-20T05:06+00:00,Not sure what's going on!,"Hi all. I feel very silly asking these questions - especially as I'm 53 and should be much better informed than I am. I was on Livial for a total of 6 years, with a break after two when I had a distasterous experience with a Mirena coil and topical progestrone. Three weeks ago my gyne took me off Livial to see how I'd get on. Towards the end of taking it I felt symptoms like PMS and has a small breakthough bleed (looking back this could have occured as a result of a colonoscopy I had when I had the torrential diarrhea what goes with the preparation for that procedure!) Anyway, over the last week I am sweating a lot. But its not like i have seen described by other people. I don't get flushed in the face and it doesn't interfere with my sleep (not yet anyway!) - I just feel sweaty and clammy and then, on occasions, I get cold. I also have constant pains in my legs - almost like I had walked for miles or exercised. I had these to some extent while on Livial too, so I don't know if they are associated. I am really tired as well and have moods that can change like the flick of a switch! I can go to bed in one mood and be entirely different the following day and feel like my life is over and I can't even face doing the simpliest of things. But I was also like this on Livial for two weeks of every month. My question is, was the Livial not working for me? Was I experiencing menopause symptoms despite being on it? Is the type of sweating I am getting menopause related or not 'hot flushing' at all? I am due back to the gyne next week to see how I am doing and I don't want to seem like a dithering fool who doesn't know what's normal or not!! Thanks everyone!!"

After the anxiety started dying down and I paid attention to my body I realised my periods had changed dramatically, swinging from happening every 16 days for a few months to then 5 or 6 weekly for a few months and then back again.  During a routine visit to my GP we talked about this and I mentioned my mother had gone through the menopause by the time she was 43 and she agreed with me that I was probably entering into the menopause (being peri menopausal).   I have some terrible symptoms such as flatulance, really painful bloating, sweats during the night etc but my main issue really is the mood swings.  Especially during the months when I'm having a period every 16 days like now I really struggle.  It seems like I'm Jekyll and Hyde from week to week. The usual PMT issues which I've always had, tearful, angry, depressed, anxiety etc but what is really disturbing me the most is that for the last 9 months it's  not just the moods but my whole attitude to my life changes.  This includes thinking badly of my oldest child and my husband, the oldest being 20 years old.  I have (in my head) left my husband many times, I feel my heart sink when he comes home from work, I'm imagining all sorts of things about him, he doesn't care etc etc and I'm terrified I'm going to do something stupid like leave him and regret it.  The strength of these feelings are overpowering.  The thing is I KNOW I love him and he's a good man and treats me well.  We get on just fine when I don't feel like this and I know I'm bloody hard work at the moment.  I have tried talking to him about all of this but bless him he's not exactly the most empathetic of people and I feel it goes in one ear and out the other. When I do feel bad I'm telling him things like he isn't making enough time for me, that I can't carry on with this feeling the way I do and the next week I feel different.   Is there any way to feel better about this?  I'm usually such a self confident, happy person, grateful for what I have etc but this is ruining my life.  Sorry for the over dramatics but that's how I feel.  Advice would be really appreciated. Louise xxx"
youngatheart1,2015-03-17T19:48+00:00,Sorry TMI but need to ask,"HI I am 55 and well into menopause, but have noticed that my chest is really sore all across top and into armpits. If I press my breasts between my fingers they are sore and feel sore inside too and sometimes can feel an odd stabbing sensation which come for a few seconds. No lumps, had mammogram about 2 years ago all ok, just wondred if you still get sore this far into menopause, have to stress not constant but at least 3 - 4 days per week at present. Seeing GP tomorrow about something else, wondered whether to mention or accept it is normal."
annieschaefer,2015-03-17T09:51+00:00,What the menopause REALLY does to your body and how to tell when it’s started…Today's installment,"Both Anxiousface and Shaznay brought of this series being run this week on DM and I admit, the first installment annoyed me. Won't waste time going over that one again, but I did read today's installment and it seems to be worth having a look over.  There are so many women, including myself that develop symptoms without realising that they may very well be a part of this ""lovely"" transistion time. Have a look and see if it may not be a bit helpful for you or perhaps someone you know.  I sure wish someone would have thought to write up something similar a few years ago, would likely have saved me a bit of unneccesary anxiety thinking I was for sure losing my mind. LOL! Even armed with this knowledge, there still are those fleeting moments I feel like I am losing it, but due to this site and you lovely ladies and articles such as today's installment are incredibly helpful.

Moniee,2015-03-16T20:01+00:00,Dizzy - not a sinus infection,"I am 49 years old. Work up three weeks ago dizzy. I have been to several doctors who told me i had a sinus infection, eye allergy, to ear infection. After taking all of the medication nothing helped. Still dizzy, but it happens less oftern. I was finally told it could be related to menopause. My periods have been awful for over two years; I need to take medications to relieve the cramps. It feels like I am about to give birth. Now, this month nothing. No period. Is this what I am left with being dizzy? How long will it last?"
shaznay96184,2015-03-14T18:57+00:00,Who are the 'Specialists' regarding Peri/Menopause that they keep talking about in the UK Press??,"Sorry girls, but I've just read the Daily Mail online (UK) and they've got a big article on how to' breeze' through the Menopause with articles running today and all of next week. Great!  We have someone in the Press on our side, at last.  But hold on a minute, who are these 'Specialists' they refer to, who 'are urging......' us ladies? As far as I'm concerned, to get to a Specialist in the UK you have to have some pretty major underlying problems to get referred to any specialist, let alone a Gynechologist specialising in all-things Peri/Meno!! No doubt if you are happy to pay privately, you can see ANYONE to discuss ANY health issue:  just most people don't have the money for this. But more to the point: to see a Specialist you have to get a referral through a GP: there lies the problem. I'm sure there are many women on this forum who would agreed most know very little about this age-old phenomenon (been around as long as we've been around!) and treat it somewhat like a taboo.  I for one will be reading these artiles with interest.  There's articles on HRT, research from the US, things we can take to help ourselves and, wait for it, even the perfect 'Menopause' Diet for us too! We should feel totally indebted to the Daily Mail for highlighting this terrible, disgusting 'disease' ha, ha, ha!!! Click here to view image Sx"

jillann,2015-03-16T12:10+00:00,Severe back pain and coping with emotions during menopause,Hi. I'm due to have a blood test to determine if I'm going through the Peri Menopause. For the past year or two my menstrual cycle has been up and down but the past 6 months or so I have had really bad back pain coming up to menstruating. I've always had back pain rather than stomach cramps but it's been so bad I'm taking 8 codeine a day just to try and ease it. Along with this I'm finding it a real struggle to keep control of my emotions. I don't know if it's related but I feel like I'm either due on or actually on 3 weeks out of 4. I've just started a new job and am concerned that this will affect how new colleagues view me and my competency at work. My GP directed me to this site and I'd be grateful for any feedback.

Ridiculous levels of anxiety and nausea, feelings of suicide etc, have been off work and so low, irregular bleeds, clotting and flooding. After seeing various GPs and being given sleeping pills and ADs I finally got to see a lovely lady specialist in the menopause. To cut a long story short i had a mirena coil fitted 4 weeks ago and am now taking Estadiol tablets. Things had really started to look up. My mood was much improved I was able to return to working a few hours and I was starting to think there was light at the end of the tunnel however, I went away this weekend with my church family. It was busy and noisy and I just couldn't cope. I became anxious then tearful, then a bit desperate. Back home now but all my old anxiety symptoms have returned. Ive been doing mindfulness which has been great but even that isnt helping today. I have been bleeding ever since the coil was fitted...was hoping it would have died down by now and am coming up to 4 weeks on the HRT. Im in a quandry as to whether to push on or try something else. Do you think this is just a blip? ladies on here seem very keen on menopace and vits. Is it ok to try these alongside the HRT??? Just dont know what to do for the best hmph! Anita"

kim94523,2015-03-12T03:48+00:00,Feeling defeated and blue,"Hi All, I had a meeting with my bosses yesterday during which I intended to ask them to let me work more hours from home because I am so physically drained by my commute and sitting at a desk and barely have time to get to my docs, let alone yoga or swimming or anything that might help me move more and lose weight and maybe help my screaming joints. But before I could bring it up, they asked me to be in the office earlier and longer! It was an amiable meeting and I left feeling appreciated and needed but this is going to be so hard on my body. I tried it today... I was walking 15 minutes in the dark in the rain to the train...and hour train ride and then a 30 minute shuttle ride. I was at the office at 8:30. By 3 I thought I was going to die. I got home by six but my shoulder, neck and back are seizing and the rest of me is stiff and achy. I don't know how I can keep this up! I am sr exec and when the board asks me to do something that is reasonable, I really can't say no. They pay me too much and - beside the hours - it is a dream job and they are wonderful bosses! I can't move closer for my son is about to start jr. College and can't live on his own yet. If it wasn't for menopause and pain, this would be no problem. I don't know what to do! I'm despondent.  My my labs came back and they are all wacky... High cholesterol and blood sugar, low function thyroid (despite taking meds), bad c reactive proteins (sign of inflammation), low vit d and very low estradiol. I am a mess. I see my MD tomorrow and my ND next week. I'm sure MD is going to want to put me on statins and other meds. My ND says statins will suppress all hormonal activity by suppressing cholesterol production, which will exacerbate peri problems and muscle pain is a common side effect...she wants me to try to take off 20 pounds (I have already cut out fat, sugar, alcohol, gluten, cafeine and red meat!) and cut my calories by 500-700 per day. I have lost a couple pounds but I don't think it will be fasrt enough. I feel like I can't do more and nothing is working!  I feel like giving up and I'm scared I won't live thru menopause. If a heart attack or stroke doesn't get me, I may keel over from shoulder pain--it's that bad or just die of exhaustion. Click here to view image"
annieschaefer,2015-03-01T20:17+00:00,Are there any success stories of Intended weight loss during Peri/Meno that can be shared?,"Help! I know there are some of you that have lost weight unintentionally during this time, please take no offense to this question. On the other hand, I have the opposite issue. I have gained over 25+lbs (I'm short so that doesn't help matters) this past year and feel swollen and awful. It seems to have settled in the mid section and thighs and butt as well. I suspect it may even contribute to some of the new aches and pains. My clothes no longer fit, so I have gone to thrift shops for the time being to get a few items, with the hopes that this is temporary and will lose this unsightly mess soon and get back into my old clothes. Deep down, I believe I should probably let go them and accept this ""new me"".   I wish I could say that my appetite has increased, it hasn't. If anything, I eat less now. I've become very selfconscious, passing on invites as I'm simply not comfortable in my skin anymore. I have had my thyroid checked 3 times this past year, thinking that was it. My blood work is fine. The doctor says it's too soon to consider sending me to a weight specialist??? Which really scares me. I do exercise(brisk walking-yoga) and I am on my feet moving around all day when I work. I don't get this at all. I have googled this issue and have seen a lot of different diets but I want to hear from anyone on here, who has been through similar and knows what exactly I need to do to lose at least 10-15 pounds, safely. I do take supplements Complex Bs, magnesium, Fish Oil, Vit D, Multi Vit and recently added Maca. Have been considering adding Kelp for thinning hair, but for now holding off. I appreciate any ideas you may have as I am fearful I won't be stopping at +25lbs."

I haven't had typical signs that I read about, change in time between periods or hot flushes. I went to the GP because I had spotting for days after my period and a few periods had been different, bright red and heavier for me, almost like faster flow, less thick. They didn't explain if this was normal or not and just said the FSH was high, I am having a second test for this tomorrow.  I was led to believe FSH was high due to not ovulating anymore and think this is why the bleeding is different - can anyone explain? I thought that if I was near menopause I would stop bleeding, low estrogen would mean a lining wouldn't build as no egg was released.  I am aware of anovulatory cycles where no egg is released and bleeding still happens. Do you think this is what is happening and is it OK?  I am not flooding, or soaking through pads, but I feel the need to go to the toilet frequently and it there is more blood flowing than usual (sorry for TMI). This happened a couple of years ago and then stopped - happened in January when I had the FSH test and then I stopped periods until yesterday.  Have had a lot of bleeding today and feel confused and worried. This is all new to me and wonder if heavy periods are a usual change in menopause?  My GP is not very helpful and just references the FSH test and doesn't explain what is 'normal' or something to worry about.  I don't want to ask the GP"

Gp tested thyroid and FSH/LH levels and told me the levels said I had ovarian failure and post menopausal.  I might get a few more periods and that HRT would be advised as I am 44.  He asked to retest in two weeks I missed a period straight after that and waited 6 weeks to have the blood tests redone along with routine Full Blood Count tests.  I have just got them back and the GP notes say ""normal ranges, no further action required"". The results in January were FSH 83.4 and LH 34.3 (out of range) Last weeks results are FSH 5.7 and LH 11.2 (normal range) I am pleased they are down and presume this means I am perimenopausal but not in menopause?  I am not going to follow up with HRT discussion right now as I don't have hot flushes.  I am slightly worried that the period problem and missing one wasn't to do with menopause at all - and the LH isnt supposed to be higher than the FSH is it? Anyone understand all this ?"
Ruthie49,2015-03-10T10:22+00:00,Memory lapse/confusion. Help!,"I’ve been doing so well since Christmas (major symptoms before that including depression, panic and severe digestive probs, weight loss etc) and was feeling more positive but have had a rough few days and I’m in a complete panic today… I was up half the night with a return of severe heartburn, acid, pain under ribs and through to back. I had to take half a valium in the end to help me sleep. The symptoms set me off worrying about terminal causes even though I’ve had a CT scan, endoscopy etc. I’ve had extremely tender breasts for nearly a week even though my period isn’t due. Also carpel tunnel type symptoms and aching joints. Anyway, I’m always walking into rooms and forgetting what I went in for but this morning scared me. I walk my daughter and her friend to school EVERY morning. The other mum picks them up from school every afternoon EXCEPT Wednesday when I have to pick up my daughter in the afternoon (because her friend has an after school club so her mother collects her later). I knew it was Tuesday this morning but for some reason I thought I had to pick-up my daughter from school. I actually reminded her that I would pick her up today in the afternoon. She said: “No, Mum, it’s not Wednesday.” For some reason I just could not understand what she meant. I felt totally blank and was still sure that I was picking her up. I had somehow reversed the arrangement in my head – thinking that I picked her up every day EXCEPT Wednesday instead of the opposite. I was saying: “Yes, I know it’s Wednesday tomorrow, that’s why I’m picking you up today.” But there is no reason that I should think that. We have had the same school arrangements since last September. This went on for at least a minute with me insisting that it’s Tuesday today so I will pick her up. In the end I could see the certainty on my daughter’s face, like she was trying to explain something very simple to me (she is 11). I somehow knew at that point that I must be wrong and she was right but realised I still couldn’t work out why. I felt so scared and confused. I felt so sure I was right about the arrangement but could see from the look on her face that I wasn’t. I felt blank and confused and suddenly very panicky. She explained once more and it finally clicked (all this took at least a minute). I apologised and said I was just tired: “Of course,” I said, “I only pick you up on a Wednesday.”This has really thrown me into a spin. I’ve never felt so confused or disorientated and it’s really scared me. Has anyone else had this sort of thing?"

In the past few months my symptoms have worsened and so I took myself back to the GP and saw a different doctor who, when checking my notes, told me that the tests undertaken showed full blown menopause! I feel cheated that I've had to get on with life, putting on weight and feeling like s**t with no clue as to what to do! He still didn't give me an answer and just told me to read up on it and go back when I'd decided whig route I wanted to take, ie whether to go herbal, HRT or not sure what else!

I have no lumps in my breast, but occasionally suffer from breast pain and fullness. Seen my GP and had a mammmogram recently. No lumps were found and no further action taken. At the moment, it looks like my breasts have increased twice the original size and they are so tender. It hurts a lot when I'm having a shower. I can barely touch my nipples. I'm just wondering since I've had a hysterectomy should I still be experiencing pre - menstrual symptoms? Does anyone have similar problems? Could breast pain be part of the peri-menopause phase?

anita31460,2015-03-02T09:34+00:00,Anyone with experience of the early days of HRT?,"Hello ladies. I have been through a real rollercoater of emotions over the past year and the last 4 months have been a living hell. I have a history of a anxiety but had been coping well for many years with SSRIs. Recently my anxiety rocketed to ridiculous proportions and I dont mind admitting I got so desperate I didnt want to keep living. My doctors were useless, shoving sleeping tablets at me. Eventually I was recommended a lovely lady consultant outside of my area. I had to ask to be referred out of area but it was the best thing I did. Finally I found someone who listened to me and understood what was happening for me. She suggested I have a Mirena coil fitted and start on HRT in an attempt to help me get my life back. I have now had the coil for 2 weeks and have been taking estradiol 2mg for just over a week. I was feeling ok but this weekend my anxiety reared its head from nowhere and I experienced panic again last night for the first time in a few months. A lot of the posts on this site are anti-HRT. Does anyone have positive experiences? Does anyone have experience of those early days with HRT? Ive just started to bleed so don't know if its linked to my cycle still? I also have a rushing feeling in my head and legs like I'm super aware of my pulse. I'm trying to remain rational so some positive experiences of HRT would be helpful Thank you ladies Anita x"

debbie03785,2015-03-10T00:17+00:00,Weight gain and fluid retention,"hello ladies. Im a bit worried about my health and wondered if I should blame it on menopause. Almost 3 years into menopause, have have the full spectrum of symptoms. Most are subsiding and hot flushes stopped a few weeks ago. A few days ago, I noticed I wasnt peeing much. Went to loo with normal feeling of wanting to go, then only passed a trickle. This went on for two days, no pain, no smell, all normal except very low volume. Noticed my ankles were swollen and I felt bloated. Ive been putting on weight steadily for months now, although I watch my diet and exercise well almost evry day. Went to doc today and have been referred for bladder and kidney scan. Seem to be back to normal today on the loo front. I started menopace, calcium and magnesium last week, but had already been taking b complex and d vitamins. On thyroxine tablets, but told my levels are now normal. Can any of you relate to this? I feel my body is out of control and the weight issue is really getting me down, stopped smoking 9 months ago. If I go on at this rate of weight gain, Im going to burst! Thanks! X"

shaznay96184,2015-02-24T15:42+00:00,Magnesium Supplements,"Hi Ladies I've been reading a lot of ladies' posts about insomnia and restlessness at bedtime.  I'm murder:  my legs seem to have a mind of their own, they're all over the place! I think I probably sleep better some nights than I imagine. But I suppose as I can sometimes get up for a wee up to 5 times a night at certain times of the month, I deem 2 trips to the bathroom in the night a good kip! Well someone suggested Magnesium Citrate to help with insomnia.  I did a little Google research and found it could be good for a myriad of my Peri symptoms, not least the restless legs and bouts of insomnia. My husband and son are pretty fit and go to the gym 4 times a week. Both have had occasional bouts of cramp and now my ol' man has a problem just above his achilles tendon area (hoping its a torn muscle above).  Well, my point here is that it would appear that Magnesium may help them with their problems too!  I'm taking Menopace Originial for B&D Vits.  Notice it has 100mg of Magnesium too.  I read that women's RDA for Magnesium is 350mg, so I'll supplement my Menopace dose with the tablets I got today. Click here to view image I'll report back in a week or so to give it time to work - or not. Be nice to hear from anyone else who's had good results with Magnesium. Sx"

shirley84100,2015-03-05T16:42+00:00,I'm 4 or 5 years post menopause...,"I have been suffering with Vaginal Atrophy which is quite common in women several years post menopause, or so the doctor said. The main symptoms for me, since last summer, have been soreness in my vagina and a need to have a pee very quickly after I've just had one. I've used GYNEST cream which didn't help so more recently I've been on Vagifem tablets. And amazingly since Monday (Its Thursday now) my problem finally seems to be improving. But its most unusual that I've drank a pint of liquid this morning and half a pint this afternoon and I've only been for a pee twice, once just after 12 not long after I had the coffee and two small glasses of tropical juice. I didn't pee much at all. Then I went to pub for lunch with a friend and had two decent cups of tea. I went for a wee before we left the pub, it was a bit more than it was at lunch time. Then half a cup of tea at home and I've not peed since 3pm. Perhaps I'm over reacting because I've not had a ""Normal"" bladder since last summer. I'm used to wanting to go almost all the time. I'm just hoping what I've said is pointing to the fact things are improving and that I'm not getting another problem. The soreness is nowhere near as bad as it was either. I'm guessing I've still got about a pint of liquid in my bladder and am in no rush to go to bathroom. Does this sound 'Normal"" ?"

Since peri and now I guess the full blown menopause, I eat 1500 sometimes 1400 calories a day and work out 4-5 days and guess what NO weight loss, I have not gained which is a good thing, but I have been trying to lose 30-35 pounds and honestly its easier to wrestle a grizzly bear than to lose 5 pounds.

I've never been full of confidence anyway but it's now affecting my work.  I question everything  I do, feel a failure if I get the slightest thing wrong and panic if I have to do something that I've not done for a while.  What is wrong with me?  Anybody else been like this? Secondly, I've had a weird dizzy/muzzy head and also experienced vertigo on a few occasions with a pulsating in my right ear.  I can hear my own heartbeat and it's quite loud.  Fortunately, it's cleared for the moment but it keeps coming back.  I do have tablets for vertigo as I've had this in the past but it just appears out the blue.  Does anyone else have it and know what sets it off? Thirdly!!!  I've an overactive bladder (which started with onset of peri) and I've tablets for this which I take at night as I've been up several times and now with the help of the medication I'm just up the once.  But I'm suffering with a  irritable urethra.  Probably due to me peeing all the time.  God when does this end???  I don't think I've an infection but I'm sore and irritiable down below......anybody any advice for this please? Apart from the above I thought I was coping quite well :0   I have completely stopped HRT.  I finished at the end of January.  Seem to be gaining weight and want to eat as much chocolate as I can lay my hands on!!  Wonder why my weight is increasing??!!  :0  Oh dear, please don't tell me this ALL to do with my hormones??

lulu99310,2015-03-04T10:57+00:00,Still bleeding at my age!,"Well i have come to my own conclusion that the menopause is a mystery just like our creation as individuals. There is not one Doctor in the land that can give you the answers you are looking for to your own individual menopause questions, and why ?  because they don,t know themselves for all their 6 years of training. I am still bleeding at 56 and i am not about to run off to a doctor to find out why when all they do is poke and prod around looking for the answers themselves. No my motto is put up shut up get on with life because life is too short figuring out what this menopause is doing to me as an individual."

kim94523,2015-02-28T18:14+00:00,Open Letter to Women,"I found this essay on another forum and wanted to share - so good! Open Letter to Women A Change is Gonna Come You are not, or were not, prepared. It is likely that your body, without your knowledge or consent, will, or already has begun to, upend your perception of yourself and the universe. It will, or already does, suck. They prepare you for your driver’s test, your SAT. There is a plethora of relationship and sex advice. How to cook, garden, use your computer, parent. Classes and books, whole sections of libraries and bookstores devoted to unraveling the mysteries of life. Why, then, the dearth of guidance and information when it comes to mid-life – the “change” – that more than half the population will face? Oh, sure, it’s out there – books, articles, even talk shows will address peri/menopause – but the event, rather, the slow unfolding process, is a sneak attack in our youth-obsessed culture. You don’t seek information or educate yourself before the fact, when it could help you. No, you seek it at 3 am, in a panic, and devour it in the hope that something, anything, can save you now. No one will prepare you, and on the eve of your commitment, your mother will say, “Now that you mention it, it was difficult at times. I do remember crying for days on end.”Thanks for the heads up, Ma. The female body is an amazing piece of work. It has ferried you this far, with its cycles, its ebb and flow. Perhaps it has given you children, the miracle of life, and nourished them. You have nurtured and loved, children or not, and built a life on the foundation of this body. A brilliant machine – I get it. But what is all this noise about “intelligent” design? Really? There is intelligence in these screaming, chaotic hormonal fluctuations? Intelligence in the crippling of my sanity? Sometimes, it seems more like a freshman design project. At a party school. Here is what will happen: Your teen daughter will look at you, hand on cocked hip, head in that “Girlfriend?!” tilt. Eye rolling will increase, as will stomping and slamming. You can’t blame her, of course – she is having her own design issues at the moment and you are useless. Your young adult sons will also look at you, as if you have sprouted a third eye. Then they will leave. You will weep and gnash your teeth, like a madwoman, in spite of the fact that their departure makes your life much easier. All reason has fled. Your husband will be a rock. He will shop and cook and still love you. You will catch him, however, muttering, rolling his own eyes and blowing air. It will really p*ss you off. You will wake in the wee hours, drenched in sweat. You’ll strip, towel off and sleep again. In the morning you’ll recall this and think, “Hmm… must’ve been hot last night.” In February — in the northern latitudes. There will be nights when you don’t sleep at all and you feel madness creeping in. Or maybe rushing in. You will drink Rescue Remedy and chamomile tea and toddies and you will somehow survive, but you will never forget just how close you were to the abyss. It will temporarily cripple you. You will make appointments and say “yes” to parties and dinners, calm and lovely, but you won’t make it to half of them. 11:00 Friday morning? We don’t know what that looks like yet. You will weep over everything and nothing. You will feel sad and silly, hopeless and giddy all at once. It will make not a lick of sense. Your doctor will look at you, a 45-year-old woman with night sweats, insomnia, anxiety and crazy eyes, and say, “No, it can’t be perimenopause if your cycle is still regular.” She will be wrong. You will hate her. You will see the world, by turns, as a glorious Eden full of unlimited possibility and a dark dead-end hell full of worst-case scenarios. You’ll be right on both counts. You may find previously mundane tasks, like driving and waiting in checkout lines, maddening and nearly impossible. And you must not venture, too often, into the depths of brightly lit, big-box stores. I am noticing now, when I dare to peek, that these places are filled with young parents, retirees, and men. Where are my sisters? You will look at the people in your family and wonder, “Who are they? Why are they here? What do they want from me?” Keep this to yourself. You will want to be alone and you will want to do nothing. Chase it. You will also want to turn the world upside down with the creative storm in your head. Chase that too. You will reconnect with old friends and you will overshare. It will be a relief and a delight when they do the same. You will see another doctor who, after an hour wait and a 10-minute visit, will hand you a prescription for an antidepressant. You will hate him. You will find sex alternately mind-blowing and non-existent, emphasis probably on the latter. This is because your brain vacillates between two messages – “Take me immediately,” or “Touch me and die.” – emphasis probably, unfortunately, on the latter. Your body may scream, “Take me immediately!” when, and if, you ovulate because biology wants you to propagate the species. Clearly, there is no real link between biology and common sense – I have propagated the species four times now and am currently just trying to keep everyone alive, myself included. Your joints will be like those of a crone. Your hips, thumbs, knees will all complain. You will Google this and read entirely too much. You will begin reading obituaries, which will remind you of the great sport you had, years ago, ribbing your Grandmother about this same activity. You will feel guilt and remorse. Your good dog will sense your new vulnerability. She will place a gentle paw on your lap and gaze into your eyes. Your bad dog will crank up the stress with his incessant barking and toxic stench. Note the genders. You may, for a time, ignore the messages from your body. You will cook, clean, chauffeur, cater large events, stay up too late, and nurture everyone’s happiness. And then you will fall down. Your body will stop asking, suggesting. It will keep you down until you tend it. You will sniff rose oil and tape dried beans to the acupressure points on your wrists. You will drink foul Chinese concoctions and slather wild yam cream everywhere. You will, at times, hear the voices around you as a cacophony and you will want everyone to shut up. Don’t tell them. You will become unhinged. You will suddenly, bizarrely, love all romantic comedies. You will want to drink. A lot. Here is what you do: Read Susun Weed. She’s odd, but she’s right. Go easy on the caffeine and the alcohol. Drink tea and a glass of wine with dinner, if you must. Leave the espresso and the tequila to the grad students. Find a fabulous acupuncturist with supplementary degrees in nursing and nutrition who happens to be married to a guy who does cranio-sacral massage. Do everything they tell you. Eat fish pills. My acupuncturist said so. Walk. Don’t stop. Everyday. I have recently noticed, now that I am one, the hordes of middle-aged women walking, everywhere. Mostly alone. This isn’t the chatty stroll with friends and strollers of days gone by. This is a purposeful, “walk to save my sanity”. You can see it in the eyes, the set of the jaw. It works, better than anything else. Have your Vitamin D levels checked, especially if you live north of the 40 degree latitude line. Supplement accordingly, immediately. Keep a journal of the madness. You’ll see how it tracks with your cycle, somehow, and at least be able to anticipate the worst. Eat really well. You know how. Just do it. To those of you on the early side of this ride, those in your 20’s and 30’s, take heed. This train is runaway and headed straight for you. If I knew now what they should have told me then, I would’ve armed myself. If the body is in great shape when this design flaw kicks in, it will be a much easier wave to ride. I have spent almost three decades building, birthing, nursing, and nurturing four children –and I’m still not done. I’ve earned my crazy pants and deserve a break, some respect, and some space. Our culture doesn’t know what to do with us. We need a mid-life version of the “Red Tent”, perhaps a year or so of escape, where the women who have made this journey can lend a guiding hand, maybe a lantern – or a drink. I’m told that there are great things on the other side of this bridge. Until then, keep in mind the positives: Menstruation will eventually stop. Looking forward to that. Your family may remain a bit wary of you. This can be useful. You will, hopefully, prepare the young girls and women for the ride. If we don’t, who will? I hear that there is a calm, present power that comes after menopause. We learn new things about ourselves, and our priorities shift, supposedly. It is a rich, complicated thing, this mid-life journey. Meet it with a smile and drink it up – or just kick its ass."

For the past year i have had many strange symptoms in varing degrees, good days/bad days, good weeks/bad weeks. Here is a list of my symptoms Lack of energy, Extreme tiredness/fatigue,feeling faint (although never fainted),dizzy on and off but always dizzy up to a week before my period,  one very bad period of 4 months vertigo. Jelly legs,shaky inside, feeling weak as though I've had the flu or something but I've not even had a cold this year.Palpitations, feeling detached, feeling like i'm about to loose consciousness (very odd feeling) the feeling you get just as you are about to go to sleep, Brain fog.Sensitive to light, eyes often become bloodshot. Headaches/migraine. Sometimes feel so cold inside & cannot seem to warm up.Periods of insomnia, bladder irritability especially in week before period, episodes of what i now call bladder fizz where bladder so irritable it feels like i have fizzy liquid in my bladder cannot sleep through this sensation sometimes accompanied by the feeling of a red hot needle going up the urethra (would be intrested to know if anyone else gets this & any remedies please? A pain I get on either side low down about where pubic hair begins pain seems to radiate to back & sometimes down into the thigh on the side of where the pain begins, doesnt seem to coincide with ovulation & randomly happens (ibroprofen usually takes it off after a couple of hours) Bloating & times of excessive wind.Monthly cyst like spots on jaw line, hair sprouting on chin & upperlip (invested in a home laser scanner) Hair beginning to thin at temples. Food cravings for something salty & chocolate particularly before period. I am almost 53 so after reading forums on here have come to the conclusion that its menopause & not some mysterious illness, thought I might have Chronic Fatigue Syndrom, just didnt realise there were so many different symptoms of menopause. Last year I did have very bad night sweats & hot flushes but they have reduced greatly, I take vit 6, eat plenty of fresh fruit/veg/salads, chicken, fish, flax seeds/chia seeds. I'm so pleased to have found this forum & to find i'm not the only one suffering through this and not going mad, hope this might help someone else."

terrielou,2015-02-27T01:31+00:00,Im 38 could it be menopause,Ok not sure if this is menopause as still having regular periods but the aremuch shorter and more painful. My biggest worry though is how bad my memory has got its really bad i get scared by it.its every day now im forgetting things even going to talk and it comes out wrong.my moods go up and down like the weather and i started to feel disassociated with every day life its kinda scary.another thing ive noticed thats weird is my sense of smell is through the roof i can smell everything more intensely.

For the past few months I have been coming out in itchy spots that are gradually spreading over my body. Some are like blisters, some are small bumps and some are in red patches. All are itchy and driving me crackers and are really bad at night when I get hotter. My doctor is very non-comittal and says it's allergy or stress or an infection. I have the suspicion it's those old hormones running riot. Has anyone else got this problem? it may not relieve the symptoms but it will hope to know that it's another menopause ""thing"" to deal with. Thank you in anticipation"

Have relied on Stool Softners which have done the trick. I eat veg, not keen on fruit and can't stand fruit juice, Have upp'd my water intake: good results. But I don't want to take these for long periods. Well for some reason I was remembering my dear ol' mum and her issues around constipation.  I believe she, myself and one sister had this tendency: the rest seem to go as often as a racing Greyhound!! Well, I remember my mum each morning making up a small concoction  of Epsom Salts, mixed to a paste with water then washed down with a cup of tea.  Within half hour she was flying past us to the loo! Click here to view image Well, that funny lil ol' girl was doing something right for once!  I read a really good article about Epsom Salts  and their health benefits.  The article name-dropped Gwyneth Paltrow and Victoria Beckham soaking in E'salt baths to reduce bloating (what?  on them two - who they kidding?!).  But more importantly it went on to mention soaking in a bath with the salts to help aching joints. Don't laugh: it also had a possible solution to my 'Greasy Hair' Thread:  make up a paste and slather it on your hair for that too!  Blimey!  If this little pot does all its said to do, it'll be the best £1.49 I've spent in ages (Boots)!! I just thought I'd share this with you, as it may work for one of us.

Now I am finding that when I am in the middle of my cycle, such as ovulation...which I figure out exactly using a ovulation calculator.  I can also tell by my terrible anxiety, achy head, and slight pain in one side by my ovary.  But, it seems to be changing, now I feel a bit foggy and out of it, achy head and very achy and sore joints and muscles.  This is a little different from when I was younger.  I would usually alway get the pain in the ovary and headache.  But these other symptoms are starting since I hit my late 40's.

My periods have been all over the place for about five or six years, very heavy, very light, brown spotting, mid-cycle mini period, I'm sure you get the picture. However, I have just taken vitamins and tried to carry on as we all do. For the past couple of months however, I have suffered from repeated infections in the intimate area, with repeated courses of antibiotics which never worked for long, plus my periods are ridiculous, for example just had four days of spotting followed by five days heavy, one day clear and ovulation, now bleeding again. In the midst of all this I went to A&E with bad pelvic pain and more soreness down below. Stayed in hospital for a few days, a CT scan came back clear, I am booked in for more tests under anaesthetic in a few weeks, absolutely terrified. My anxiety has reached uncontrollable levels, been prescribed Setraline, I am also constipated and bloated. I just want to avoid everyone and sob as I am so scared and out of control.

I and a number of other women on this forum have begun or are using this Bioidentical Progesterone Cream (Wellbeing), but I've not read a post from anyone who has been using this Cream long-term. I am currently ping-ponging in my head whether to continue with my trial (started 1st Jan) or just give up the ghost, go see my GP and get some prescribed HRT. I need something - anything! - for the aching joints mainly and long-term bone health. Just be nice to hear from someone who has been a long-term 'user' and singing its benefits (or otherwise) as I don't want to keep prolonging putting off HRT (I'm 54 - probably been Peri for yonks and yonks, judging by my moods, lack of libido, drying skin etc. Shame the blob hasn't stopped or become irregular grrrr!) for the sake of me ol' bones. Be great to hear back from someone who has used Bioidentical Progresterone only for the longer-term. S x PS - One good thing I've just read on an American bioidentical site is that Progresterone is believed to be the 'Happy Hormone' and that some women report a feeling of 'euthoria' when they're nice and balanced.  I have commented on her about having that very feeling when I finished a very long bleed over Xmas/NY. Felt really good, up-beat, and it went on at that level for ages. I actually feel pretty good - mentally - still.  So maybe this stuff is working for me afterall????"

I went through my 50's without too much bother. About 3 years ago all of my symptoms became much worse. I have a lot of muscle and joint pain, chronic tiredness, depression, itchy skin etc. My hips are so bad I had exrays and scans done--was sure I would be having hip replacements. The results showed my hip joints are in perfect condition! I AM glad about that---however the pain in them is still there, as bad as ever. I have always been super active, mainly with my work on our cattle properties. Now I have lost interest and have to push myself every day. All I feel like doing is taking pain killers and going to bed. However, I try not to give in to it. I actually feel my best when I am working outside or planning some project.

joyyoga,2015-02-14T07:01+00:00,Results clear,Hi all Good news all my blood results clear of anything horrible my white count is actually healthier than before. No signs of peri menopause but I heard that it doesn't always show. So I am pleased and still confused about why I feel like this and why my stomach/bowels still sore. My mum had bad stomach during menopause and we all have IBS in my female family so I guess I'm just stressed and it shows! Still taking care of myself but struggling to get calories in balanced against soreness! Any food suggestions? Veggie. Thanks
shaznay96184,2015-02-06T19:40+00:00,Help! I'm having a Hormonal Bad Hair Day!!,"Hi Ladies I know lots of you have posted so many of the Peri symptoms, and I know that thinning hair and brittle nails appears on so many posts. But I have to ask:  have any of you experienced - or are you experiencing it as I am - hair so lank and greasy, you could fry chips in it??!! My hair's naturally blonde - alright, blonde-with-lots-of-white/silver-'highlights' - so any bit of grease makes it looks really slick.  I have been blessed (I've made it my friend as its easier) with a natural white streak at my parting since I was about 41-ish which now looks like I'm going bald there!  I can cope with the colour: I know some women would pay a fortune to have my 'highlights'!, but its the having to wash it all the time that's doing my head in (no pun intended). I did notice it was getting drier last year, and attributed that to the ever-increasing white/silver streaks: result!  But now I'm back to buying different shampoos to try to combat this (Q: why don't they sell shampoo for 'Greasy Hair'?  I'd be OK if it was 'Naughty', 'Unruly' needed 'Taming', was 'Frazzled'.....but not good ol' greasy??!) There must be at least one lady on here who can empathise with me?  I know hair can be tempremental, but hormonal!!  Ain't it enough that we had to endure that as teenagers?! Any suggestions, advice or good ol' fashioned naming a brand will be very welcomed.   Just fed up with my hair looking like it needs washing every  day. Sx"
shaznay96184,2015-02-13T12:48+00:00,HRT and Constant Scaremongering - I can't keep up with it all!,"Hiya Ladies Now as you know, we on this site can be a, how can I put it, sensitive bunch(!). We have the daily grind of wondering 'What does today hold for me?' - and it's hardly Groundhog Day as one day is NEVER the same as the next! At the moment I am completely med/HRT free for any Peri symptom I present.  I ache like a 90yr old most days but, having taken lots of fantastic advice from my 'sisters' on this wonderful Forum, I have given in to taking a daily dose of Menopace Original, in an attempt to get the ball rolling and see what 'route' may work best for me. It's probably mind over matter, but I do feel a bit better generally for taking them (oh, and for drinking more water. Thanks for that advice girls!). I have very strong, personal views on the use fo SSRIs for Peri symptoms, but I can see that many ladies have used them for many years (family members included here) and sing their benefits for the better of quality of life they have gained through their use. I just don't think I warrant them any time soon, but no doubt if things got really bad for me, I know that they will be available to me. I struggle with wanting to go get some HRT started, with my attempts to 'go it alone' - or at least with the occasional help of some Bioidentical Progesterone Cream. And that's only when I remember to use it! I'd say, having read lots of posts, I am definitely Perimenopausal, but maybe my symptoms at the moment are very, very mild compared to the majority.  I'm hoping its not the calm before the storm, but don't kid myself that this is it:  I'm still bleeding regular as clockwork and at 54 truly believe that I'll be one of those unfortunates who will suffer a late Menopause. My mum and sisters were all virtually into full-blown Meno by my age.  I can only assume I must have been very good in another life! My point I'm raising today is more a debate that a question.  I love a bit of news, and read it on-line every day.  I've read some very positive articles regarding Menoalready this year........until today. Now I think of myself as a bit of a hard nut, nothing much fazes me, if someone upsets me, woe betide them etc etc.  But today's HRT Scare for the Day is.........a link now between HRT use and Ovarian Cancer, no matter how long you have been using it!! Sorry girls, call me a cynic, but has someone got it in for us women??!!  I'm 54, have never had a major illness in my life.  I don't smoke, drink, take prescription - or recreational, although I sometimes wish I did! - drugs.  My only vices in life are that I swear like a trooper (out of earshot of the young, elderly and infirm!) and I eat crisps like I have shares in Walkers!! But I sometimes feel that I'm in the 'wrong place, wrong time' for most things. By the time I'll really need HRT, it'll probably have been withdrawn on health grounds! I figure we've all got to go sometime.  At the moment I believe by even THINKING of starting HRT I run the risk of a stroke, heart attack, breast cancer, blood clots, and now ovarian cancer.  But are they not a daily threat to me anyway? I'm not foolhardy, and will consider all options available to me, but this daily bombardment of 'if you take HRT you're going to die from this, that and the other' gets a bit, well, boring!  I know there are plenty of ladies who have gone the whole 'natural' route and good luck to them. But I also read here of so many ladies whose quality of life has been dogged by this bloody Curse, and have got great support from HRT.  I will only take so much before I concede and give into HRT, because I believe the later I start taking it, the longer I can enjoy my relative 'youth' or what's left of it!  I don't want to put up and shut up, go without sex and all the fun that comes with that (nah, not thinking boring '50 Shades' here at all!)........and then try and get some of that back when I'm in my 60s and probably looking and feeling like I'm 90, and by that time my ol' man's past it too! For someone who's considering starting HRT, I need just a little reassurance from my 'sisters' on  here.  But one thing I must ask:  has anyone actually known ANYONE who has developed ovarian/breast cancer, or had a heart attack or stroke that has been DEFINITIVELY LINKED to taking HRT???   I know lots and lots of friends and family who are taking prescription meds (some for many years) who admittedly do have some side effects of their meds, but NO-ONE who has developed more life-changing side effects.  My lovely, late mum took very strong meds to combat TB in her bones.  But 'Old Age' got the better of her, not the kidney failure that the meds could cause.  I rest my case.......!  I want to go down fighting like her; doing the white knuckle rides in Orlando aged 72 and singing and dancing until her late 70s before the hip replacements go the better of her (3 in total).  You would never have known that she had suffered really major illnesses in her life: a true lover of life xx! I think its safe to say that I'm in one of my 'Debating' moods today, so handing me news headlines like this was not a good thing! Click here to view image Sx"

Beetle1965,2015-02-12T00:36+00:00,Early Menopause - body changes,"I am 44 and have been recently been told I am menopausal (not officially for a year of no periods) and I am feeling quite overwhelmed by everything that is shifting about. For the past year I was having what I now know were premenopausal symptoms - not feeling rested after sleep, anxiety levels through the rood for no particular reason, skin changes (dry, wrinkles, reactive, greasy then not etc) Feeling hot and heat and redness in my face, not typical hot flushes with sweat.  Intermittant dry eye and feeling hot then cold. All of these things have calmed down for the moment and I have missed my first period and it feels very strange.  I have never missed a period and never been pregnant.  I have felt weak in my muscles at times and overwhelming tiredness, then it will go away, I do feel a bit flat/depressed as well, I was not ready for this change and haven't had children, so I think it's taking me a while to accept.  I haven't much of an appetite because of the stress of this news. Click here to view image I feel like an adolescent asking all this - but really I had no idea about all the areas of the body that change.  I only heard it was hot flashes and changing periods - neither of which I have had. Feeling really upset and quite annoyed - but I can't change it."

lesleyk,2015-02-10T18:05+00:00,I need help with difficult menopause symptoms,"Hi, I'm brand new to this group, so apologies if this/these subject(s) have been covered already.  I have been undergoing menopause for about 12 years, having started quite early at age 48.  My first six years were evil - really bad hot flushes, no sleep, night sweats, depression, so having tried every natural remedy I could find, including homeopathy and acupuncture, I caved in and went on HRT.  Brilliant!  It took away all my horrible symptoms and I returned to ""normal"", EXCEPT I began to have migraines - something I left behind in my twenties.  I know migraine can be connected with fluctuations in oestrogen levels, and in my case that is certainly true, but a migraine every few weeks seemed a small price to pay for the relief of all the other symptoms, until a few months ago I began having very frequent migraines, three or four a month.  I dropped my dose of oestrogen to the lowest possible, but it didn't have much effect and in the end, with the agreement of my GP I stopped HRT altogether.  Now I have the hot flushes, night sweats etc all over again.  I am writing this feeling hot, sweaty and dizzy.  I don't want to go back on HRT because of the migraines, but I don't think I can go through these menopause symptoms again. Oh, and I have been trying Folic Acid (I read an internet article) and Black Cohosh but nothing is helping so far.  Can anyone come up with some advice - I'm getting desperate!"

I have mentioned this to the doctor but they never do anything, no test or anything but I'm guessing at this age it must be.  My periods are taking ages to come as well.

Please help!,"Hi.I'm after some advice if what im going through sounds like Perimenopause. ve been reading the posts with great interest after searching symtpoms that are driving me crazy.. My nan and mum both had early menopause I am 32 nearly 33 and didnt think could be hormones as young and being totally dismissed by GP, untill I saw a segment on this morning detailing similar symptoms... I have a long list of physical ongoing symptoms since Aug so over 6 months now.. are the symptoms of peri ongoing like this? My sysptoms are daily and the headaches are daily. There are days or several days I feel ok (not as bad) then it hits again.. The DRs have prescirbed me anti Ds which I cant take as i am too sensative to meds so at the moment having accupuncture and councelling for anxiety. This all started in Aug on a hangover, I had been having hot flushes but I drink allot due to the nature of my job and put it down to that and since stopping alcohol they seem to have subsided however i do get warm and sometimes think ive got a temperature normally in the upper chest area butthis doesnt happen often. in Aug i was watching tv and got this wierd sensation in my head like it was shutting down, its hard to describe but like my brain was stopping I went to a&e and they said i had a pnic attack this happened a few times then the headaches started and ive had daily headaches since.. mri, eeg clear, all bloodtests clear, urine and chest x ray clear.. since then ive had various panic attacks, muscle twitching, a rushing feeling through my body and now they way it manifests itself is that I feel ill all the time, i cry and complain.. how do i feel so ill.. like a virus, im tired allot, i tire out just trying to speak, im an outgoing party girl and i dont feel like going out at all, i notice not often but sometimes my speech is odd like i have to think about it, also not often but does happen i walk into a room and cant remember why im there, my headaches are worse in the evenings, i feel faint, allot more so when i feel ill and if i have a panic attack now i feel as if im going to faint, im dizzy allot even at night and lying down and can feel faint all day blood pressure ok i suffer derealisation, anxiety, frequent urination worse at night it feels uncomfortable, i did also have a cyst on an ovary about 6 months ago and this went away on its own. i feel completely fed up and like i just want to go back to how i felt before all this.. I dont feel the Drs have helped me at all and ive just started accupuncture and am seeking therapy but even when i suggest the symptoms to ppl they seem unsure as there wasnt anything to trigger the anxiety and my physical symptoms are so ongoing and severe Does anyone considering my family history think this could be peri and how do i get a definitive answer, i notice someone suggeted hormonre sticks.. i currently have the contracpetive implant and im going to get this out on wednesday so have no idea how my periods are please help im so sick of feeling sick and getting me down, I really do feel that ill for 6 months now xx"

As a result of premature menopause at the age of 41 and horrendous day and night hot flushes and very disturbed sleep, I relented and started Elleste duet. Although this worked wonders with my hot flushes it didn't help with my mood swings or libido. I pleaded with my GP to give me tibilone. I'm now in my third month and although my mood swings are better, I was really hoping it would work wonders on my libido, but to no avail! i guess I should mention that I am on anti depressants, which can also lower your libido, as does depression. The saying 'what's come first? The chicken or the egg?'  Come to mind. Any way, what I am asking is really how long should It take to work or will it? thanks in advance for any advice"

Think I'm the worse culprit! But can I just ask:  aside from the ladies diagnosed with IBS pre-Peri:  Has anyone found that things are even more sluggish than normal? Hate to say it, but my WHOLE persona changes if I'm constipated: it takes over my every waking hour, fretting about how long I haven't been; how hard its going to be (like giving birth sometimes, believe me!); should I take a laxative etc etc?? Have upped my water intake, and have been peeing for Britain!  Have always loved a wide variety of veg, not so keen on fruit (hate juices) as I'm more a 'savoury' than 'sweet' gal.  Xmas saw the true emergence of my relatively controlled sweetie craving, so will avoid sweets/biccies etc as I wonder if there's even a connection here- OD-ing on sugar?? Have to admit to resorting to a mild laxative now and then, and since a bout of unusual, and unwanted 'looseness' from 1 Jan (which tied in with Xmas Period Pt 2 urghh!) I've gone full circle. Its got to the stage now where I've really struggled for 5 days. Now on the stool softeners!! Have never had piles, but know enough about them to worry about internal ones as opposed to the external.  After 'giving birth' earlier this week, it felt like I'd been booted up the jacksie: throb. throb. throb. I know a lot of ladies attribute this to IBS. Have to admit my bowels have always beeen quite emotional TBH!  Having run a busy business for 22 long yrs, I had been very good for caring for others, meeting their needs etc, but I think as a result I had enough stress to develop IBS.  Now I'm a lady of leisure (bored!) I thought they'd lighten up. Huh! I come from what I would call an extended 'windy' family, and we've never really been one's to hold back on this front. However, in terms of IBS, I NEVER, EVER get diahorreah. I've got a gut of cast iron, me.  Click here to view image"

It has help with joints etc but I still get very anxious. Most of the time I don't know what for. Yesterday I was shaky, tired, dizzy and kept getting surges of panic. When I went to bed I couldn't sleep even though I was drained of energy. Hence today I am feeling just as anxious. When will it all end. I'm so fed up with feeling this way and always fearing the worst. Every ache/pain is magnified when I am like this and I have that much tension my teeth hurt from clamp jaw. I began my period three days ago but have only just really got going on it today. Does anyone else feel like this on their period three or so days in? I'm wondering if it is because of this but I'm also wondering if you can take too much b6 and b12 and this have an effect too. Sorry if I'm covering old ground ladies but I just need reassurance that I'm normal because at times I feel like I'm going to go mad with it all. Helen."

jen_xx,2015-01-28T22:50+00:00,Early menopause,Hi ladies I'm new to this and I'm wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar to what I have can help me.. I'm 37 years old and I had the marine coile for a total of 8 years. My period faded after i had the coile fitted and was gone within a few months. When I got a new coile fitted I had some light spotting.. the coile is removed over 1 1/2 year now and I have not had a period. My gp sent me for bloods and they confirmed that I have gone through early menopause.  Luckily I had bloods done 5 years previously and when my gp looked back into the results he confirmed that my hormone levels were at their highest when I was 32..(to be honest I don't really understand it all)  I do realize how lucky I am as I have two children and I have not suffered from any of the major symptoms I have read about only the odd meltdown and because of the coile stopping my period I didn't realize that I was going through early menopause. My delima is that my gp now wants me to start on hrt in case of osteoporosis (I'm awaiting the results of my Dexter scan) but I'm so frightened when I read all the pros and cons of hrt. I really don't know what to do.. can anyone give me a better insight as to what I should do?

I then had Femseven Sequi patches but they just kept coming off. So my current regime is Oestrogel and Utrogestan which I have been taking vaginally. I've been on this regime for just over 3 weeks now. Started the Utrogestan on day 15 as instructed but only managed to take it for 7 days. I have developed a urine infection and feeling so irritated with a stinging sensation down below, hence couldn't bear inserting another Utrogestan. I was just wondering what other ladies use as the Progesterone part of their regime and does it matter that I've only taken the Progesterone for 7 days instead of the recommended 12?

I've bled for 19 out of the past 25 days with a break in between. Last year the same happened. Not sure if its the emotion of the time of year (find it really sad with having lost loved ones).

(FSH lower than Menopausal levels and Estradiol more than Menopausal levels)  I've had 4 biopsies in 5 years, 2 sonohysterograms, D&C, Polypectomy, Hysteroscopy, Endometrial Ablation and so many ultrasounds I can't count them anymore.   My lining is showing that I'm at 6mms but, no one seems to know how much is lining and how much is scar tissue from the ablation and D&C.   I was given Provera (medroxyprogesterone) at 10mg/day for 5 1/2 months to thin the lining (all normal biopsies) from 12 mms down.  I am now at 6 mms.   I am now to take Provera for 14 days every 3 months to clean out any built up lining until I reach menopause (please come soon!) However, the Provera causes some pretty nasty side effects in terms of HEAVY bleeding, cramping, anxiety, water retention, breast tenderness, LONG period (12 days of heavy bleeding) etc. and about another month after stopping it and the heavy bleeding to feel right again.  By then, I'm due for another round of it.   It has been suggested that I try Prometrium at 100mg every day (non-stop) instead to keep the lining thinned until Menopause.  However, I've been reading some pretty nasty stories about it too.   This time, I want to do research as had I known then, what I know now, I never would have allowed the ablation to be done.  I'd rather be safe than sorry with these meds.   Can anyone tell me if they've tried both (the Provera and the Prometrium) and which one they did better on?   Your help would be much appreciated!"

I was told that this would cause an immediate medical menopause due to the sudden stop in oestregen. I wasnt told anything else other than the surgeon wrote tomy doctor saying this lady may require some hrt help. Well i was completly un-prepared for what followd. within two months l was an emotional wreck crying morning noon and night, flushes all the time and my whole body aching so badly l could hardly walk mornings, l felt 90 not 55. I stupidly carried on until the following may going down down down until l pleaded for help from my doctor. My mother had died from breast cancer so l really didnt want HRT but bu now l was desperate. The doctor did blood tests and my Oestregen level had gone from 400 and something to 27, you need HRT she said. By now my confidence and self esteem were on the floor. I was a nervous wreck, permantly anxious and crying all the time like a tap. I felt so insecure like l was not a woman anymore, l felt threatened by every lovely female that came near and it felt so real and frighteneing. The terrible arguments it has caused due to this sudden extreme insecurity was devasting on our marriage of 34 years. My husband didnt know what to do with me or what on earth had happened to me, its been a hell rise and the docs seem to know nothing.Antidepressants are all that they offer or a self esteeem couse. I did it all and nothing worked,the self esteem courses said l didnt have a problem in any other area just this awful personnel loss of esteem and confidence. I have now had Estorel 50 patches of hrt for nearly 7 1/2 months and l still feel awful. The flushes stopped quickly and the terrible aches and pains within 3 months but the emotional side is debilitating still.I have stopped so many normal things due to anxiousness and l still feel so fearful around attractive woman, its like im another person in another body with another personality and brain. So scary and so alone. I hope there are some other woman out there that can help with this so l dont feel such a freak. Help Help"

Night sweats; flushing; lethargy; lack of interest; insomnia; mood swings; loss of concentration; poor hair & skin quality. To be fair my actual periods were getting less heavy and less painful. They were more or less regular give or take a week.  Last year after trying anti depressants (which did nothing) GP agreed to put me on HRT. The first one I tried was 1mg Ellestra Duet which eased most symptoms but not quite the night sweats so it was upped to the 2mg dose. I felt like a new woman! Really positive, sleeping well, energy enough to exercise. Felt like I'd been given a wonder drug. Half way through the first packet the problems starts. Stomach cramps and urgency to open bowels... OK I'll cope with this. Then it started to get really bad. Within 20/30 mins of eating I would have to go irrespective of where I was and it was virtually liquid - not great when your out hiking!!! Returned to GP and was swapped to Femiston. Some bowel disruption but ended up with  3 week period.  Returned to GP and asked to try patches - have had patch on one week. This morning within 20mins of having cereal for breakfast, got agonising cramps, fainted, then had liquid diarrhoea & vomiting.  Im thinking the only way forward is HRT and dairy free diet. Any suggestions?"

Brevis,2015-01-18T17:20+00:00,Urine infection and piles. Stressed and worried,I'm due to have an operation next week on my neck which I am very scared about. I have suddenly developed a urine infection for which I am taking antibiotics and the piles which I've had for many years are incredibly uncomfortable. Could this be to do with stress and anxiety? Can anyone suggest anything other than the over the counter creams which could help wth the itching and discomfort? I am peri-menopausal and wonder if this is also making things worse.  Every day is a real struggle. Help!

But on top of it, I got some bothersome news in the mail. Usually, I would handle bad news relatively level-headed but because I was already feeling anxious, that information sent me over the edge with anxiety. I thought, why am I so easily upset these days? I can remember a time when I was always the one everyone came to for support. Now I can't seem to handle the slightest thing. Does anyone else feel like it's harder to cope with things these days?"

My periods have been irregular and ridiculously heavy for about a year now. I work away from home a lot and often stay in hotels so this had become a real issue for me. I have suffered with bouts of anxiety and depression for about 20 years but had been symptom free for many years thanks to Citalopram (SSRI) .. however in november the stress of work, heavy periods and being away from home took its toll and I crashed into a frightening bout of hideous anxiety. I am used to the symptoms but this was something else.i felt so desperate at times I didnt know what I woulddo and I was scared. I am convinced my current anxiety is linked to my hormones and am now thinking I may be perimenopausal. I am desperate to find a solution as ive now been off work for 11 weeks and am dreading going back. Ive had a few good days but then I crash again and it all feels so hopeless. I feel physically sick and am struggling to eat.i deliver training on mental health so feel really u useless that I am struggling to manage my own. Is this all down to my age??? I am 48"
mariealgarve,2015-01-15T17:26+00:00,coming off HRT,"I have been on hrt for over 20 years and have tried 4 times to come off it.each time has been horrendous. I suffered terible night and day sweats and have had to go back on it every time .    I am on estraderm mx 50 patches I was on 100 strenght about 10 years ago and managed to get myself down to the 50 strenght  patches but the 25 strenght patches were absolutely useless it was like  I was on none.  Last year my g.p.asked me to come off them again she refused to give me them.  I have a form of eczema that covers my ches,t breasts, trunk,stomach, back, legs and arms which is there permantly and when the sweats start it is un bearable.the itching.    So  I ended up going to another g.p.and getting my patches back. Yesterday I had to see the other G.P. again and she was much nicer and mentioned me coming off it again. I did the million womens study based at the Liverpool womens Hospital and there finding give HRT a very good name. We had a nice discussion and she stated she was not telling me to come but to try and wean myself off it.  By cutting my patch . now when you cut the patch you also cut the sticky off so then you need sticky tape to keep it on and I know that once I do get 25 on my patch i will have my sweats and  itching back..  I said I would think about it my sister suggested trying Sage tablets as they helped her but as sisters we are not medically alike I dont have any of her ailments so I wonder if that will help me I was thinking of giving it a try and weaning off the patches .  I was looking for help and came across this forum and now i am fearful off coming off them I had hysererctomy in 1995 and I am now 66 years old . I would like to stay on it till i die if i could . The eczema I had came on me 10 years ago after my son got cancer and has never left me.  I am in good health I had a kidney out in 1990 with cancer and have never looked back health wise. Can any one help or suggest anything."

For 2 years I have been feeling unwell, strange niggles, cramps, varied mood swings, anger, frustration.  Weird dreams so real that I cant tell the difference between what is real and what is the dream.  this doesnt make life very easy for me as the dreams can be me taking a parcel to a department at work and then weeks later the department asks about the parcel and i say that I took it but it has never actually arrived. dreaming of conversations that havent happened.  Anxiety when having to go somewhere on my own.  Wanting to eat all the time, waking very early in the mornings and then not being able to function properly during the day.  The other morning my husband came in from nights and after looking around for the source of a funny smell found that the iron had been left on all night and it was sited next to the microwave and sodastreem machine.  I was lucky i hadnt burnt the house down.  I am so short tempered with everyone and feel as though i have to defend myself in everything I do or say.  Since the doctor prescribed me with Premarin (5 weeks on) I do feel slightly better as in I am no longer thinking of just walking out of the door and taking that step towards the big blue sky.....  Are these feelings normal?  Is there anything that I can take along side of the prescription that will help with the moods, my husband is a saint....  I wouldnt put up with me like I am now."

EvaServal,2015-01-11T04:12+00:00,Migraine Headaches & Pressure Headaches,"Hi Ladies, I'm not trying to scare anyone or freak anyone out, but I feel I need to tell you all about my experience.  I've been having migraine headaches, pressure headaches, dizziness and nausea. I kept chalking it all up to menopause. Because as most of you know, so many of these symptoms are menopause.  Last Friday, Jan 2nd at around 7:30PM my boyfriend and I were leaving a restaurant, suddenly I started getting shocks in my right leg like my leg was falling asleep, while I was walking to the car. This shocking feeling quickly radiated up my arm and into my head, all on the right side. My boyfriend quickly started toward the hospital. On the way I lost the ability to formulate sentences and words. I would say one sentence and a totally different sentence would come out. I would try to say one word and a totally different word came out. Being a former medic the only word I wanted to relay was ""stroke"". It felt like someone had tased my right side. It was the most frightening thing I'd ever experienced and I was awake for the entire ride. After getting to the hospital I was in the ER for about 3 hours. Then sent to Neurology/Stroke ward. For the next few days I had a battery of MRI's, EEG, EKG's, CT Scans, Blood Work, Ultra Sounds and a Spinal (Lumbar Punch). Within 6 or so hours I was able to formulate sentences and say words again. I forced myself the entire time. My right side started getting feeling back within a few days. I still have some numbness in my right hand and am experiencing peripheral neuropathy symptoms in my right leg and foot.  The neurologist found a mass in my brain. Thanks be to God that it is benign. I just found out yesterday that I am cancer free. However, they still don't know what the mass is. It could be a tumor or a jelly bean I stuffed in my nose as a child. (joking) But we won't know for a while.Also it might be inoperable too. I will be seeing the Dr on the 13th for an MRI Rx. In a month we'll do the MRI and see what has happened with this mass. Is the edema gone, has it shrunk or grown? Things like that. So my point is: Please get checked, please don't do what I did and write it all off to menopause. It could be, it may not be...either way, please get checked.  Click here to view image"

I'm also getting stressed about the idea of my pets dying or my parents dying. I've always been a worrier but not to this extent. I feel that part of how I feel could be linked to the fact that i lost both my father in law and my mother in law last year ( within 7 months of each other) but I'm wondering is peri as much to blame. The days I'm at work I get up and give it my all but on my days off I'm like a zombie with little motivation and a cocktail of peri symptoms.

sharcerv52408,2015-01-08T23:40+00:00,Weird Feelings,"I had my annual physical today with a new GP, that alone made me anxious. While in the waiting area I started getting that anxiety attack feeling. It affected my bp. Lately I get anxious when I go to the doctor and it makes my bp elevated. I have what the medical world calls ""white coat syndrome"" which is when someone's bp is elevated only at the doctors office but can be normal otherwise. Mine was 160/92 at this visit. I am currently on Losartan for bp issues but do not feel it is working and asked the doctor to switch it and she said that Losartan alone was not enough and she added Norvasc at 5mg. We'll see how that works out. Lol! I told her the Losartan gave me heartburn and that my GI doctor put me on Omeprazole at 20mg but that it didn't seem to be helping me anymore. So she increased that to 40mg instead of the 20mg that I was on. We'll see how that works. I fasted for this appointment because I thought they would draw blood for lab tests but the lab tech was out today so they said I have to come back. When I got home I started feeling weird symptoms. My legs felt funny like really weak. I was walking but they didn't feel like they were my legs if that makes any sense. My neck hurt a little and I felt like when I tried to talk my tongue was a little stiff like I was slow of speech. It was weird. After I ate something I took my Losartan and waited half an hour. Then I checked my bp which was 140/78. I guess all of these weird symptoms was anxiety mixed with the elevated bp and the fact that I had not eaten that morning. Plus, I'm due to see my period in 5 or 6 days. When I go back for my blood work, I am going to have them check my glucose level. The new doctor asked if I was on an SSI for anxiety and I told her I had tried Paxil and Zoloft neither of which worked out right for me and that I'd follow up with my GYN next week when I go to see her for my annual pap. Let's hope she is competent enough to help me with these symptoms. She is going to be a new doctor as well."

I had a referral at work to occupational health and of course barely sat down before dissolving into tears.  I nearly took the wrong road to get there ( which of course should be a familiar route).  Before I went, I tried to phone to confirm I had the correct date and time, but, despite staring at the letter, managed to phone the fax number. The letter also stated ""unit 12"", so I turned up at ""unit 10"", thought I must have the wrong place, so drove out of the site completely.  He acknowledges I have a problem calling it ""mild but significant memory loss"". Now it's a horrendous wait of blood tests, before they consider doing proper memory tests.  He said it could be hormonal, deficiencies, anxiety.....I am frightened to death it's dementia and am now in a complete state.  I don't have any other symptoms you ladies speak of, no aches or pains.  I did have several night sweats going back a few months, but it all came on in September with sudden ""spaced out"" feelings, which has turned into total forgetfulness on a really scarey level.  And yes I am the one who drove off without paying for fuel and had the police around. I am also the one who works with aluminium and God knows what other metals.

Have been hospitalised twice with what I thought were heart attack symptoms, chest tightness, heavy arms etc.  Now the episodes seem to present differently with dizzyness, headaches, strange pains in neck, a feeling when I wake as if I am going to pass out, and a floating pins and needles feeling in any or all parts of my body!  I should say I am still having periods and my GP wanted to throw HRT at me even though I didn't really see how you can prescribe drugs without first gaining an understanding of your hormone levels, when I requested testing I was told testing was unreliable.  Desperate for a solution, I did go with her recommendation and tried HRT but found that the symptoms in fact got worse so stopped taking the medication. Have had all sorts of tests which all came back clear so now I just don't know what to do or where to go.

I woke up with a stuffy nose and felt like the way it does when you have a cold like you can't fully inhale on one side of your nostrils but when you blow your nose there is no drainage. I realized that this was probably yet another peri symptom because I don't have any other cold symptoms. I started feeling that panicky feeling and had to talk myself down to be calm. These symptoms are annoying. I wish they would just vanish into thin air just as easily as they arrived.

I took HRT for a number of years and stopped about 10 years ago. Plain sailing until 3 years ago when i had some pain and bleeding, it was discovered I had a large uterine polyp which was removed, and a mild cistocile and rectocile, for which i have been given a silicone pessary for. I've had a couple of episodes of brown/red discharge since wearing the pessary, both were investigated and found no problem. Yesterday I started again with brown/red discharge, accompanied with left sided pain, it is a liitle worse today, so i have had a swab taken and my GP has reffered me for a PMB appointment on the 30th Dec. Since having the swab done this afternoon the pain is worse and low down central as well as on the left side. I had a normal smear in august 2013. I am really scared and worried now... any advice please"

shaznay96184,2014-12-23T17:06+00:00,SSRIs - Are They the Way to Go??,"Hi All Literally just joined this forum as I felt a little isolated, having nowhere/no-one really to discuss my perimenopausal symptoms with.  Hold on a minute, that's not entirely true.  I do have someone I talk 'at' - my darling husband - but I think if I want to save my brilliant marriage of 31yrs, I think I'd better cut the bloke some slack and back off! Well after about a year of experiencing what I believe are some perimenopausal symptoms, I took myself off the GP. Saw a Nurse Practitioner, who I reckon is about my age (54) - but the difference is she looks in control, a bit sexy, and like she might even be getting some even! I talked about my symptoms: lack of libido; insomnia; slight flushes; inner 'furnice' waking me; frequent visits to the loo and really aching joints.  Please note though ladies, as I think I made a bit of a boob mentioning that I was a little tearful, and had cried when watching 'Don't Tell the Bride' (!)  Bloody idiot - talk about walk straight into her hands.  She was nice, I won't say she didn't listen, but her first course of action was a blood test to check specifically for Vit D deficiency for the aching joints, but we talked about another course of action that she reckoned was a life-changer for some women:  SSRIs = 'Happy Pills' as I conned them.  Oh hum.......well after reading up on these via Google, I was astounded by the number of and diversity of the side effects.  Honestly, for someone who really wants to get jiggy again, one of the main side effects was, wait for it, 'Lack of Libido' - ironic or what?  Listen, I've never been the 'gagging-for-it' type, but I'd far rather have a smile on my face after a session, than the result of a 'Happy Pill'!!  Safe to say, they were ignored.  Couldn't see the point on trialing a 4wk course of a drug that would make me more nutty than I actually feel(!), which would take me 4 times as long to wean myself off of!! I won't rule them out tho', as I have no idea really what's in store for me.  But at the moment I'm more concerned with the physical symptoms that may be able to be addressed (aches, disturbed sleep etc).  I'd be interested to hear from anyone who is actually taking SSRIs as part of their menop treatment:  positive and negative opinions both appreciated. I've read some lovely posts today, and the one thing that shines through is that we all want to keep our sense of humour/smiling.  I've definitely still got mine:  I just want a smile on fact that tells you lot 'She's getting some' again!!!:D No doubt you'll see me on here again. Merry Christmas Ladies - and don't forget: If the turkey doesn't turn out perfect, remember there's always cheese on toast!  Or, if you're like me, you'll tell them all 'Tough!'.  But lets face it, who's would be brave enough to upset a perimenopausal woman on Christmas Day??!!!! Click here to view image S"

sharcerv52408,2014-12-19T22:15+00:00,Blood/sugar levels dropping during peri,"The days leading up to the start of my period always makes me feel crazy. This month I had sensitivity in my left hip /groin area. Then my thighs were aching. Then today I was out with my little one at the doctors and had to run other errands and I didn't eat anything before I went out and I felt so weak. First of all, I was bundled up because it's cold out then when I went into the store they had the heat on so I felt over dressed.  I went to bend down to fix my daughter's shoe and when I stood upright again I got so hot. Sometimes when I get overheated like that it can bring on an anxiety attack. I felt like I was going to pas out. I ran into a sandwich shop to eat quick as I could. That seem to calm everything down. This is something that has happened to me before right before a period or like at the beginning that if I haven't eaten and get overheated, I get weak and feel faint. I think I read somewhere that our fluctuating hormones can mimic diabetic and or anemia symptoms. Your blood/sugar level can drop. I have a physical coming up in January and I am going to have them test my glucose level and my hemaglobin. They have checked a couple of times before and it has been normal. This only seems to happen to me during my cycle and it's random not every month. So scary and crazy. Oh the joys of being a woman, indeed!"

This lady at my church is my husband's Godmother and has been more like a mother to him since his own mother lived abroad. During my peri symptoms  I have lost weight. She came up to me and began questioning what's going on. I told her my weight loss was hormonally related and I thought she'd understand since she used to be a nurse and is post menopausal herself. Everytime she sees me she makes comments about my weight like,  ""are you eating? "" ""you need to gain more weight. "" As if I'm doing any of this on purpose. I sometimes feel anxious about all of these symptoms anyway and to have to be bombarded with it from others doesn't help. How can I tell her to bug off without being rude?

On day two of my holiday, which it had been really looking forward to, I suddenly suffered a real ""spaced out"" kind of feeling, which I just couldn't shake off.  It felt like someone had flicked a switch in my head and I went from being confident, happy and relaxed to feeling like I was totally a different person.  Absolutely horrible.  The fact that it didn't improve left me feeling like I was going mad.  It put such a dampened on the holiday.  When I got home I went straight to the doctors, burst into tears and said I just felt totally spaced out.  With no physical symptoms, she said the most common cause was anxiety.  But I have struggled to fathom this.  Yes I have  quite a stressful job, but I have always managed stress well, with a good outlet in sport.  Today I had a blood test to test for thyroxin, calcium, full count etc and, have asked for FSH, after speaking to my sister, who is a GP..  Am really hoping it shows up something that will explain my feelings.  I just want to feel myself again.  It's horrible.  Anyway, am trying to fathom out whether this is sheer anxiety or perimenopause, or something else?  I am 44.  The other thing is, I was diagnosed several years ago with a prolactinoma, which basically, is a small, benign tumour, which sits on the pituitary gland and affects the levels of prolactin produced.  This can affect oestrogen levels, giving you low oestrogen.  I was on medication for a while until the prolactin levels came back to normal, otherwise there is an increased risk of osteoporosis.  I came off the meds, but recent tests have shown raised prolactin again.  I have never had oestrogen levels checked as they say the levels vary so much, it,s hard to gauge.  anyway, just wondering whether this could all be having an effect?  Any replies grateful received, thankyou"

jayneejay,2014-08-30T10:43+00:00,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) & Peri / Menopause & Menstruation,"useful info ....  Question: Is There A Relationship Between IBS and Menopause? Answer: For most women, menopause will have an effect on IBS symptoms. As part of the process of menopause, there is a decrease in the levels of the sex hormones,estrogen and progesterone. There is a well-established relationship between these sex hormones and digestive symptoms, most likely due to the fact that receptor cells for these hormones are located throughout the digestive tract. Thus, the changing hormonal levels of menopause do have an effect on IBS, but what that effect is is not completely clear. The evidence to date currently provides only conflicting and incomplete evidence about the change in IBS symptoms during and after menopause. For the most part, population surveys indicate that women experience a decrease in IBS symptoms following menopause. The number of women with IBS appears to decrease after the age of 45 and by the age of 65 IBS is experienced at equal rates in men and women. However, many women report an increase in IBS symptoms following menopause. This may be especially likely around the time of early menopause (perimenopause). It has been theorized that this increase in symptoms at the time of early menopause is due to the lessening of the levels of sex hormones that occurs at this time, in much the same way that women experience an increase in IBS symptoms in the days surrounding the onset of menstruation."

Just google Hormone Defeciency Test it is about the 3rd link down on the page. Some of you ladies may have already done this but thought I'd post it for those who havent found it yet. Our hormones are like a roller coaster daily during peri and some of us go through peri guessing, like our doctors do(when they put you on birth control thinking your too young to go through the change at your age), like mine did. When I first started peri I was such a basket case... I spent more time in the ER then I did at home. The symptoms can be very frightening and make you feel like your dying. I knew I wasn't gettng anywhere from seeing doctors every week with the same blood test... that all appeared normal!!!... so I decided to just make a chart and see everyday for a few months what Im high and low in...if that makes sense. Every person is different and there is so much help on this forum that all the ladies have given...I'd be lost today without them, still feeling as though I was the only alien on the planet, that felt like I did. I realise God intended for a woman to go through the change of life...so I except it, pray daily for wisdom and strength from him, to get through it!  Dont get me wrong I still have bad days and my bad days are VERY bad but I have come to the conclusion that the herbs I take on Monday may not work the same for me on Wednesday...my experience is all through lots of trial and error but if I can help someone get through peri natural, then Ive blessed someone other then myself.

I'm 49 and over the past 4 months or so I've noticed a change in me that I can't put my finger on.  I've been making mistakes at work and can't concentrate . I work on a Reception and kept forgetting what somebody had just asked me.  Even if I try harder to concentrate, it's  no good.  I've been feeling drained and taking deep breaths - a feeling I had when I had anaemia.  Blood tests were all fine for anaemia and thyroid but my doctor said that a blood test for hormone balance wouldn't prove anything so she didn't test me for that. So I'm left feeling that I'm either losing my mind or it could be menopausal.  I just feel miserable and I've got nothing to feel miserable about. I'm having mild hot spells in my face but I didn't connect this with anything. I don't want to go into work for fear of making more mistakes. I simply don't feel like me anymore and I've lost my 'get up and go'.  Whatever this is, I feel like I'm losing control. Does this sound menopausal?  Thanks for reading this."

jen65504,2014-11-17T00:07+00:00,What to do,"I had 1 ovary 1 tube removed from opposites sides when i was 25 was told that i would most likely suffer from early menopause because of this. They were right i started it when i was 35. I went crazy. I started the hot flushes then i started losing the plot for example hanging on to the shelves in the local tesco or adsa, because i had lost my mind and co-ordination, i saw a doctor and told HIM what i knew what was wrong with me (the menopause) he didnt believe me, it took about nearly a year to convince him and get a blood test to prove him right, he eventually prescibed me hrt (cant rememmber which one it was as it was later discontinued) they kicked in about 3 days later and whooo i had never felt better, my life was worth living, i was happy, more so than i had ever been in my life. After they were discontinued i was prescibed another, premak c 0.625, they worked but not quite as much as the 1st ones. Then i moved abroad  to another country which lacked a decent medical service and i ended up soucing the premak without precription or routine examination because i could not cope without them and could not get from the uk without flying back to the uk and pretending i still resided there. The prempak ran out for some reason and the chemist lady gave me a unprescipted replacement called Climen, they caused severe leg/foot cramp and a period, (for the first time in 9 years!) i stopped taking them after 1 month and went without for 4 month, was ok to begin with but slowly slowly all the bad symtoms came back untill i again inquired about premak and got it again, well i was really excited about this and thought i would be better again in 3-5 days, but i was wrong i have taken nearly 3 weeks of them now, and if anything i feel worse, im stressed out and im very agitated, i feel sick then i flush and then im frozen, it is all just a nightmare, thats 12 years now in total, i just want it to end, i look at my self in the miror and the cry, i think i can cope with the flushes its the stress and agitation thats getting me down now so i started taking amitriptyline also unprescribed to calm me down..im 47 now and i want it all to stop..."

Have had low mood and insomnia since this time and am now wondering if I should not have resumed hrt on return from holiday as perhaps my own hormones were stabilising, OR if my hormones took a big slump. Not great on last 2 weeks of patch and now on 2nd 4-week run with oestrogen patch.

sharon03228,2014-10-23T11:15+00:00,"new member, not sure if in peri","Hi, I have read this forum with great interest. So many helpful posts. My problem is I don't know if I am in Peri or not. I am 47 in 4 weeks time. About 2 to 3 years ago, I had a phase of hot flushes which lasted for about a year (maybe 1 or 2 a month), then they stopped and I seemed fine, then about a year ago I had real anxious feeling and feelings of doom, and felt like I was a bit crazy. That stopped and then I had a few months of mood swings, one minute feeling fine, next minute really irritable. That seems to have stopped now. Over the last two months, I wake up feeling like I have been hit by a truck overnight. Hurts to put weight on my feet when I get out of bed, but these aches and pains get better once I am up and moving around. When I sit down to watch tv after dinner the aching comes back. I am also having heart palpitations and heartburn and reflux, sometimes feeling like food has not cleared my throat and gone into my stomach, which can only be relieved by sicking it back up (litterally only a very small amount) then it is relieved, but I have near constant tingling feeling down throat and a dry throat. Caffeine really makes this worse, so no coffee for me! So my question is, when in peri, do symptoms tend to come and then go, to be replaced by other different symptoms? Do all my symptoms sound peri? Periods are heavier and approx 5 - 6 days long, over the last 2 years and some have been a a few days late, but more recently they are a few days early, my last 4 periods have only been 25 days. ~I started my periods at 16 and had always been a regular 28 day cycle on the dot with light bleeding for 2 - 3 days!

I have been having them on and off for the last few years so I've been aware that I was perimenopausal. In the last six months they have been a nightmare to the point that I visited the doctor with the intention of getting a prescription for HRT. The pharmacy had run out of the one that the doc had prescribed so I was supposed to return. In the meantime, my magnet arrived in the post, which I had almost forgotten I had ordered. I decided to give it a go. That was over two months ago and I have not had one hot flush since I've been wearing it. Truly brilliant! My husband thinks its a load of twaddle but I dont care. All I know is that since I have been wearing it attached to my underwear, I have not had a hot flush. I have bought two more, one for my sister and one for a friend. They are going for it too. Already my sister says she is feeling the difference. If this post can help anyone suffering with horrendous flushes then it would be brilliant! Good luck!"

I know this is briliant news, GP said more than likely I am perimenopause (even though she said at 42 I was too young originally!) and I could try the coil. Since I had the kids I am too squeamish to use a tampon so no way was I having the coil, and my body isn't too keen on medication so I have decided to sit this out and put up with it. I can cope with hot sweats mingled with freezing to death. I can manage all the aches and pains, anxiety, dizziness and tiredness. The moody ups and downs we are managing with humour and pamper time (blessed to have a teenage daughter and a lovely hubby and son) so all that I can cope with it. What I am struggling with is this heavy bleeding, and probably only the few days it is really bad because I am up every few hours in the night changing towels, I am changing in the daytime every hour at least and I can't plan to do anything in that time. I would be so grateful if anyone could tell me how long this stage lasts and if there is anything natural that could help? Thank you"

jayneejay,2014-10-10T09:34+00:00,Tingling Extremities Menopause ..Useful Info...,"Do You Tingle? Is it A Sign of Menopause?    useful Snippet  While not a common sign of menopause, tingling sensations in your extremities, medically known as paresthesis, is an unsettling symptom some women experience and it can occur at any time. In more mild cases, it usually comes about after a certain body posture pinches a nerve or presses on an artery, causing a limb to temporarily ""fall asleep."" In these cases, the tingling extremities usually return to normal after compression is relieved. Tingling can affect any part of the body, but commonly the feet, legs, arms, and hands and are usually the result of fluctuating estrogen levels. Fortunately, this does not indicate that something more serious is going on. Nonetheless, women who are experiencing this tingling sensation and those who are curious about this sign of menopause are wise to learn more about its causes and treatment.  Symptoms of Tingling Extremities Changes in sensation ""Pins and needles” Prickling or burning sensations Numbness or reduced feeling Increased sensitivity Creepy crawling feeling While fluctuating estrogen levels are the primary cause of tingling extremities during menopause, other medical conditions can trigger tingling in the hands, feet, arms and legs.  They are: Nerve injury(from neck or lower back injuries) Spinal cord injury Hyperventilation Herniated disc Vascular claudication, or lack of blood supply to an area Anxiety Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Diabetes Migraines Multiple Sclerosis Stroke Seizures Thyroidproblems Electrolyte or vitamin imbalances/deficiencies Medication side effects While tingling extremities during menopause is not usually cause for alarm, there are some cases that would require medical attention. They are: Weaknessor paralysis Back, neck, or head injury Inability to control the movement of an arm or leg Loss of bladder or bowel control Loss of feeling or tingling on one side of the body Loss of consciousness Slurred speech Vision changes Trouble walking If you experience any other unexplained symptoms along with tingling extremities-such as increased urination, worsening of symptoms while walking, rash, muscle spasms, or pain, it’s wise to seek medical help also. Because most cases of tingling extremities during menopause do not require medical attention, it can be important for women to learn more about the treatment options available.  Treatment For Tingling Sensations  As with any sign of menopause, it’s usually wise to begin with the least aggressive treatment and move on to the next method only if relief is not achieved.  In most cases, a combination of lifestyle changes and natural therapies is the most effective and safe approach to tingling sensations during menopause. A good, balanced diet, hydration, and adequate sleep are basic lifestyle measures that can help. A doctor can also recommend other changes that can help to ease the tingling. Using certain natural treatments can also help to get to the source of tingling. 100mg Vit B6 can be benificial for all menopause symtoms .."

jayneejay,2014-10-09T17:03+00:00,The Peri-menopause Phase ... Useful Info ...,"The Perimenopause Phase The symptoms of menopause are tied up with fluctuating hormone levels. Symptoms are worse during perimenopause than in menopause itself because this is when the levels fluctuate the most. Sometimes levels rise to normal levels other times they come crashing down. When you reach menopause your hormone levels are consistently low so they don't trigger symptoms in the same way, although some symptoms (often different ones) can still occur. In perimenopause the most obvious effects come from fluctuating levels of estrogen. Here's how it works:  1. Your ovaries produce less estrogen (specifically estradiol, one of the three types of estrogen). As a result less estrogen reaches your brain. 2. Less estrogen in the brain causes a decrease in endorphin levels. Endorphins are the so called happy hormones that keep our moods regular and act as natural painkillers which make us less sensitive to pain. 3. The brain panics because there are lower levels of endorphins hanging around so it thinks something is wrong. It reacts by sending out bursts of adrenaline to kick-start your system. Specifically it sends outnorepinephrine (the hormone that triggers fight-or-flight, see dangers of stress for a more detailed explanation).  4. The burst of norepinephrine raises our heart rate (causing palpitations) so that we are ready for action. It raises blood pressure, causing our blood vessels to dilate, leading to hot flashes and sweating. If you're sleeping you may suddenly wake up, or you might get a bout of diarrhea or flutters in your stomach. Common Perimenopause Symptoms Irregular Periods Hormone fluctuations interrupt the ovulation cycle, some months you release an egg from your ovary, some you don't (hence declining fertility, see what age does fertility decline?). If you don't ovulate you don't produce enough progesterone to have a period. This results in irregular periods. Headaches Women already prone to bad headaches or migraines in the days before or after their periods may suffer more headaches during perimenopause. This is because you are likely to be particularly sensitive to low levels of estrogen. Women who experience their first migraine during perimenopause however usually find they disappear again after menopause. Mood Swings Mood swings are common feature in most women's lives. Mood can fluctuate around period-time, and during or after pregnancy - so it's hardly any surprise that mood swings feature again in our perimenopausal years. Although scientists don't completely understand why - it appears that low levels of estrogen (common to all these occasions) is linked to lower serotonin levels. Serotonin is another one of those 'happy' hormones related to moods. Low levels make us irritable, prone to feeling pain and less able to sleep soundly. Other related articles, see menopause and depression as well as the effects of depression.  Memory Failure You may find you lose your train of thought half way through a sentence or you go to the store and forget what it is you went for. Memory problems are very common in perimenopausal women, this is because estrogen is necessary for facilitating communication in brain cell neurons. Fortunately as estrogen levels stabilize postmenopause, memory returns to normal. Skin Changes One day you look down at your hands and notice that the texture has changed. Suddenly you notice your skin is dryer, you may also have noticed a few extra crow lines around your eyes and patches of dry scalp on your head. Whether this is a natural part of the ageing process or if declining levels of estrogen speed up the process is still open to debate. See, menopause skin changes. More Hair And Less Hair Hormone imbalances can be responsible for hairs that start to appear on the chin or on the backs of your fingers. It can also cause loss of hair or thinning hair on your head. Although both estrogen and androgen levels are declining, the rate of estrogen loss is faster, meaning the androgen suddenly has more prominence. One side effect of this is hair loss. Read about menopause hair loss. Fibroids Nearly one third of women have fibroids by the time they are 50. Fibroids tend to get bigger as you approach menopause but don’t usually change or grow afterwards. Fibroids only require treatment if they become symptomatic - see symptoms of fibroids. Women with endometriosis may also find that it flares up in the years approaching menopause but then subsides and even disappears afterwards. Breast Soreness Breast soreness is a common feature of menstruation, pregnancy, breastfeeding and perimenopause. It is a symptom of hormone fluctuations. However, always consult a doctor if there is any nipple discharge or lumps (symptoms of breast cancer). Also, read how to carry out a breast self-examination, which is particularly important as we get older."

I always suffered with migraines, I thought I'd got it from my Dad.....but then on what I thought was a seperate issue I was being diagnosed for infertility as I was unable to have children. You could practically set your watch by my periods, every 21 days, the pain was absolutely unbearable, FSH levels sky high, LH levels through the floor. Eventually I went into the menopause at 38. Around the same time my migraines got a whole lot worse and I now suffer with them every month. I think I get two types of migraines, but one of them around the same time each month. They can be so debilitating they can on occasion have me on a drip in hospital. They have seen me black out completely and just wake up wired up to machines and intreveniously trying to fill me back up with fluids to rehydrate me. Unable to walk, talk or anything. So now, here I am at 45, my latest MRI is clear, my neurologist has retired and and I am on Topiramate and I have developed other symptoms not so desirable. I now also have Anxiety and depression, possibly caused by the Topiramate. Topiramate has a few contra-indications, as in it doesn't like many other drugs. All in all, it's a pretty stroppy drug who doesn't like to have friends! Wants you all to itself by all accounts.... So last week I was tried on Sertraline.....oh dear.....the doctor checked the contra-indications.....she said it would be ok.....instead of the normal 50mg, she would have me start on 100mg because I was not a small person.....well, within 24hrs I was in a pretty bad state and am still suffering a week later....my anxiety is rife.... So, there is my story. Still open-ended.....Does anyone have any experience with menopause and migraines? can anyone relate to anything I am going through? Can anyone share what they have done to deal with things?"
AVR1962,2014-10-06T06:41+00:00,Fatty Liver can Lead to Symptoms,"Has anyone picked up ""First for Women"" magazine, Oct 6 edition? According to this article the following sumptoms are indicators that you might hvae a fatty liver: *Excess weight, especially in belly area *Problems with memory and concentration *Dark circles under the eyes or discoloration of skin around neck, ankles knuckles, elbows or knees *Light-headedness, dizziness or weakness *Chronic tiredness *A feeling of tightness or fullness in the center or upper right region of abdomen This article was saying that fatty liver is affecting 75% of women over the age of 40. There are many reasons for fatty liver which you can look up on a search and would suggest that you do if you feel this might be related to you. The article suggests a liver cleanse to reboot the system. The magazine suggests natural ways the cleanse the liver. One thing I just want to add here is that while I do completely agree that the liver could be the reason for these sysmptoms and I do believe in cleansing the liver, a person does have to be very careful how they go about a liver cleanse. There are some herbal products out there that will cleanse the liver but herbs are not FDA regualted and so if your system is sensative generally you might want to do half, or the lowest suggested dose, to see how it affects your body. Several years ago when I was having digestive issues I decided to do a liver cleanse. This fitness instructor helped me, told me how to take it, I aksed all the questions I thought I should know. The herbs ended up being to strong and the wrong mix, according to my doc. I ended up in ER with high blood pressure (never had it before), my sleen was swollen, my pancreas was swollen, my gallbladder was swollen, I had vertigo, my body wanted to turn left when I was trying to turn right, I had high calcium levels, I had just several small kidney stones, I could not think not even well enough to use an ATM machine, my joints hurt, I could not sleep, I had a stiff neck, I was having pains in my chest and my stomach was on fire. I was a mess. It ended up doing some nerve damage. Basically is caused a toxicity in my body. It took me 2 years to rebuild myself using vitmins and watching my diet very carefully. There for awhile I was pretty much eating nothing but boiled chicken with vegetables, I had to watch all acidic foods. It took 5 months for my stomach to repair itself. The products I used and would warn against using these were the Elemis products which can be found on Amazon. Don't be afraid of a cleanse but do use common sense. Juicing is a great natural way to cleanse."

Snatchpiece,2014-10-06T12:45+00:00,SOY MILK - IS IT SAFE,"Newspaper coverage this week focused on whether soy could cause breast cancer to spread and the report by New York researchers found that high levels of soy protein genistein (found in soy milk and tofu) could accelerate the progression of breast cancer cells. The facts The study at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre in New York examined women already diagnosed and being treated for the disease, but did not look at the effects for women not yet diagnosed or for use in prevention. This was a small-scale study of 140 women who already had recently had breast biopsies and were diagnosed with stage one or two breast cancer and were all scheduled to have a mastectomy or lumpectomy two to three weeks later. For the study, half took soy protein powder containing genistein while the other half took a placebo for between seven and 30 days before their operation. When the scientists compared tumour tissues from before and after the operation they found changes in the expressions of certain genes that are known to promote cell growth only in those women taking the soy supplement. Jacqueline Bromberg, co-author of the study, said: ‘Although the genes were being expressed, it is not clear that this will translate into actual tumour growth. But the concern is that there may be the potential.’ She went on to confirm that only 20 per cent of those patients who took the soy had really high levels of the genistein metabolite. The changes were seen in women who consumed around 51.6 grams of soy – the equivalent of about four cups of soy milk a day. Do you need to worry? One of the reasons soy has been so popular over many years is it has benefit as a good source of protein for vegetarians and has been linked to the low incidence of breast cancer in countries where it is a staple food. However, its role has become more controversial in recent years and certainly women with a family history of breast cancer, and particularly those who have been diagnosed, are advised to avoid it. The researchers concluded those who eat soy regularly could ‘reasonably consume a small amount’ through the course of a day, particularly vegetarians and those who do not eat dairy products. If you have no history or risk of breast cancer, and eat soy products in moderation, there is not a high risk at all, but this study seems to indicate that soy may exert a stimulating effect on breast cancer in a sub set of women already diagnosed"

Whilst watching TV last night I sensed I was agitated so I checked my blood pressure which was probably a bad move as it was high 175/83….. This reading obviously made me extra anxious and when I went to bed it felt like my heart was going to pound out of my chest. I was also feeling dizzy whilst lying down. I got up and re checked it again and it was 188/80 I was getting myself in such a panic I actually thought about going to the hospital I was convinced I was going to have a heart attack or stroke. I contemplated writing my daughter a letter giving her all my bank passwords and telling her what she needed to do if the worst happened. How darn crazy is that?

AVR1962,2014-09-29T10:54+00:00,Info Hormonal Balancing,"Been reading and wanted to share, especially those dealing with irritibility, sluggishness,and heavy bleeds. Your body requires adequate amounts of vitamin B6 to maintain optimal levels of progesterone. The lack of this important vitamin may decrease the production of progesterone. Vitamin B is also necessary for the liver to break down estrogen. If it doesn’t break it down, the levels of estrogen increase, creating hormonal imbalance. This means that levels of estrogen become higher than progesterone levels. Good amounts of vitamin B6 can be found walnuts, whole grains, lean red meat, poultry, seafood, bananas, spinach, beans, potatoes, and fortified cereals. Take also vitamin C! A study has shown that 750mg of Vitamin C taken every day for six months can considerably increase the progesterone production. Zinc is essential for hormonal health and it is extremely important for the production of adequate levels of progesterone. Zinc is the mineral that prompts the pituitary gland to release follicle stimulating hormones, which in turn promote ovulation and stimulate the ovaries to produce estrogen and progesterone. Good sources of zinc are veal liver, lean red meats, shellfish, crabs, dark chocolate, wheat germ, chickpeas, and pumpkin, watermelon and squash seeds. Magnesium is another key nutrient for increasing progesterone levels, as it plays an important role in maintaining a healthy hormonal balance in the body. You can either take dietary supplements, or eat more foods that are good sources of magnesium such as black beans, spinach, raw plantain, halibut, whole grain cereals, pumpkin and squash seeds, okra, and nuts. Avoid all herbs that can increase levels of estrogen – with estrogen dominance, your progesterone levels are lower. These herbs include blue cohosh, black cohosh, dong quai, hops, lavender, licorice, motherwort leaf, rhodiola rose root, red clover blossom, saw palmetto berry, and tea tree oil. A herb that is good for balancing hormone levels in the body is chasteberry, also known as vitex. It can stimulate the progesterone production and reduce levels of estrogen, as well as amounts of prolactin, which is another hormone that can lead to low progesterone in the body."

Lara66,2014-09-28T13:28+00:00,PMT - when will it end?,"Hi ladies. Can anyone suggest a natural remedy for PMT? I'm well into peri but still having regular periods, most months anyway, and still experiencing irrational PMT symptoms. Every month for my whole menstruating life, I have an emotional meltdown a few days before my period starts and I do or say something I regret. This month, I quit my job, and it's not the first time it's happened !! Now that my kids are both at full time school, I've spent all this year trying to get back to part time work but it's been an uphill struggle. I finally got a job a couple of weeks ago, which admittedly I wasn't crazy about, but I was struggling combining it with school runs etc. and so told my boss it wasn't working out, at which point she offered to reduce my hours. I told her I'd think about it and would get back to her the next day but stupid PMT wouldn't let me see things clearly. I still couldn't see how it would work out for my family and so turned down her offer. Since then, I've started my period and hey presto, I can see things clearly. I can now see how it would have worked, with a little extra negotiation on my part, and I'm so angry with myself, damn it !! I feel like I've let my family down. After 35+ years of PMT and periods, I am finally admitting I need help. The words 'horse', 'door' and 'bolted' come to mind but it would be fantastic if I could get some help to ease these final years of menstruation. Any suggestions?"

jayneejay,2014-09-18T17:55+00:00,Awareness .. Is your HRT made from Pregnant Mares Urine?,"Is Your HRT made from Pregnant Mare’s Urine?by Angie Macdonald on March 24, 2014 in HEALTH, MENOPAUSE If you’re pre or post-menopausal you may have been prescribed or even begged your GP for Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) to try and relieve some of the awful symptoms. Perhaps you’ve read up on the wonders of bioidentical hormones and decided you’d like to try them. But, if your experience is anything like mine, you would have been fobbed off by your doctor and told that bioidentical HRT is too difficult to take, or there’s not enough known about it, and been handed a prescription for Prempak-C or Premarin. What is Premarin? If you’ve been prescribed Prempak-C, Prempro, Premique, Premarin or the combined menopausal-osteoporosis drug Duavee (formerly known as Aprela), you have been prescribed a synthetic form of HRT that contains conjugated horse oestrogens. The Premarin family of drugs contains estrogenic compounds that are made from the urine of pregnant mares. That’s where the name is derived from: PREgnant MAres’ urINe = Premarin. Any HRT with Prem in the brand name is likely to contain conjugated equine (o)estrogen (CEE). Although it sounds disgusting, you may still be wondering what the fuss is all about. After all, we may eat gelatin or inject Botox, and most of the time we have no idea what ingredients are in our medicines or beauty products. So what’s wrong with a little pregnant mare’s urine if it’s going to get rid of your hot flushes and make you feel better? The problem is two-fold. Firstly, drugs containing CEEs are not well tolerated by the human body and the Premarin family of HRT increases the risk of suffering from thrombosis or a heart attack or breast cancer. And secondly, treatment of the pregnant mares is very cruel. The Women’s Health Initiative Study and Risks of Prempro Use Back in July 2002 the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) study into hormone therapy was stopped abruptly because it was clear that long-term risks of Prempro use clearly outweighed the benefits. Prempro was a combination pill made up of Premarin and Provera, a synthetic form of progesterone. Women in the study on Prempro were found to suffer more breast cancers, heart attacks, strokes and blood clots than the women taking the placebo. The results of the WHI study sent shockwaves around the world and women stopped taking HRT in droves. Doctors stopped prescribing it and for over a decade there was a lot of confusion around the safety of HRT. Unfortunately, when the results of the study were publicised, no distinction was made between synthetic conjugated horse oestrogens like Premarin and bioidentical oestrogen and progesterone. Bioidentical Hormones Bioidentical hormones are synthesised in laboratories from hormone precursors found in soybeans or yams and their molecular structure is designed to be an exact replica of the hormones produced by your body. This means that they are easily recognised and produce few of the side effects and diseases associated with synthetic hormones. The Risks Associated with Premarin [Premarin tablets] According to Dr Uzzi Reiss in his book The Natural SUPERWOMAN, some of the risks and side-effects associated specifically with Premarin include: Inflammation Increased body fat Cardiovascular events Arterial sclerotic disease Venous thrombosis (blood clots in veins) and Migraine headaches. And recent research published in JAMA Internal Medicine Journal in January 2014 found that “CEEs use was associated with a higher risk of incident venous thrombosis and possibly myocardial infarction than estradiol use.” Premarin in the Most Commonly Prescribed HRT in the USA Premarin is manufactured by global pharmaceutical giant Pfizer. On their website they say “PREMARIN is the #1 prescribed branded estrogen therapy for the relief of moderate to severe menopausal symptoms.” It begs the question, if so much is known about the risks of Premarin, why are so many doctors continuing to prescribe it for their menopausal patients? PMU Farming and Cruelty to Horses Apart from the obvious health risks to women, there is also the issue of cruelty to horses.People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) describe how the pregnant mares are: “Tied in small stalls, unable to move either backwards, forwards, or sideways or lie down comfortably, they stand with sacks strapped to their groins for months on end. In order to make the urine more concentrated, their water intake is restricted, so the horses are constantly thirsty. The foals are considered “byproducts,” and most are fattened up, slaughtered, and sold for horsemeat or turned into dog food.” [Premarin horses in stall] Up until 2002 Pregnant Mares Urine (PMU) farming was big business in North America and Canada. Hundreds of PMU farms churned out gallons of oestrogen-rich pregnant mares’ urine on a daily basis and were handsomely rewarded by large pharmaceutical companies like Wyeth and Pfizer. But the WHI scare saw a drop in Premarin and Prempro sales and after 2002 many PMU farms were scaled down. Now, according to equine advocacy organization The Horse Fund, most PMU farming has been relocated to countries with less regulation, like Kazakhstan and China, which has a reputation for animal rights abuses. Just Say ‘No’ With so many safer alternatives on the market it seems unnecessary to still be manufacturing synthetic oestrogen from pregnant mare’s urine. Not only is it a cruel practice, but it is harmful to the health of the women who are prescribed it. So, if your doctor prescribes you Prempak-C or Premarin, refuse to accept the prescription. You are under no obligation to accept it. Object on the grounds of animal cruelty and the fact that it is associated with higher risks. Ask for bioidentical hormones (usually in the form of oestrogen patches or gel and Utrogestan progesterone capsules). If your doctor is reluctant to prescribe them, ask for a referral to a Menopause Clinic or a Gynae-Endocrine Consultant at a hospital. If more and more women refuse to take this product, there will no longer be a commercial reason to manufacture it. And that will not only benefit the health menopausal women around the globe, but those poor suffering pregnant mares as well. “We are not spiritually unconnected from the drugs we take, or the pain and suffering that goes into their making.” — ALICE WALK"

Whatapain,2014-09-18T16:23+00:00,HRT - to take it or not to take it?,"Im interested to know others comments on the pros and cons of HRT. I've been on it for nearly ten years. I'm taking prempak c-0.625 mg. I do not get hot flushes, I look younger than my years, my sex drive is rubbish, but I'm guessing the low dose causes that. Dependant on which GP I see at my practice, they will tell me that I need to come off HRT as been on it too long. When I read about life with menopause symptoms, I'm struggling to get to grips as to why I would stop taking it.  Are the risks of taking it long term greater than the misery of menopause and frankly looking old and being disregarded as a woman? I'm thinking that I should ask my GP to change my HRT to one that would give me better sex drive and all the other benefits, but fear he will only say that it's time to stop. I'm convinced the minute I do then my triathlons will stop and my life will become a misery.  Do the risks of taking HRT outweigh the thoughts of a miserable life without it? Or am I worrying unnecessarily?  Doesn't seem fair that we have medication to enhance later life for women, but only for so long, also should doctors be looking at other lifestyles that have health risks when stopping HRT for women that are happy with it, as opposed to women that smoke, drink, eat too much and don't exercise."
patricia60ko,2014-09-14T16:30+00:00,Fibroids and Menopause,"Hi everyone. I am new to the forum. Menopause started for me at 50 and I'm turning 54 this month. When symptoms became unbearable (severe hot flashes, drenched after them, terrible moods, suicidal thoughts, not sleeping) and really affecting my work, I sought help from the GP. I did try alternatives first like black cohash, st. johns wort, excercise, diet, but nothing helped to the point that I could function normally. The doctor was hesitant to put me on any HRT because of breast cancer in my mothers history. But I didn't care. I needed relief. I was put on Livial. There was immediate relief. Now, 2 years later, I had pains in my side and had tests, scans etc, and they found what was described as a 'tiny fibroid'. I said well surely that is what is causing the pain. I'd never had a fibroid before but it had to be. I got one doctor who said it could not be the case. Instead she changed my HRT to the most expensive one on the market Prempak-C. With this one yout get a 'period' every month. She wrote out a 6 month perscription which I refused. I tried it for a month. But asked to see a gynocologist. I was referred to one and got a quick appointement. The gyno said the Prempak-C was not the best choice as periods would exaserbate the firoid. So she took me off of it and prescribed Kliovance. She also prescribed a weeks' antibiotics incase there was any infection. Needless to say, the pain ensued. No change. So she wanted to do a laproscopic surgery to have a look in. We did that only for her to tell me that it was indeed the fibroid causing the pain. She took me off HRT, told me I'd have to manage the symptoms and hot flashes somehow and that the fibroid should shrink in 3-6 months. I am left with the pain and now the symptoms of menopause. The flashes are back, albeit not as severe as before. I can gradually feel my mood lowering so am considering seeing the GP about antidepressants. Now is not the time for me to be depressed. I am job hunting. So I wondered if any of you have heard or experienced similar circumstances. Any advice or comments will be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

Don't Suffer In Silence!!,"Ladies I am sorry, I mentioned the other day in another thread that I was not on any meds' it slipped my mind totally I am indeed on one called Escitalopram""  I am a super hyper person and the joker of the pack, but I have suffered from anxiety all my life, I have tried to mask it, but when alone my mind works overtime, it got worse 2 years ago after the death of my mother, I would be constently thinking about death and worrying non stop about the slightest thing, I have a very demanding job and work in executive management, (no excuse) but when working I am fine when alone, I am sometimes a basket case, I faught it off for years trying to pretend it was normal, but this new dr I have held my hand and said to me that at this time of life with our hormones so out of balance, some ladies need that extra bit of help, I really dislike taking anything that is not natural, but after talking to the dr and her telling me that Escitalopram works wonders for her patients, and would like me to give it a try, so I decided to bite the bullet and go for it, I have been on it just over 2 weeks and maybe its a combination of the vitmamins I am taking and getting news that I was Vit D deficient (so increased my Vit D) that is making me feel better, but I don't have that fog in the brain feeling anymore, and my eyesight is getting better, and I can see small print again ( I had lasik surgery last year, so again no excuse). What I am trying to say is if you really are suffering then please tell you doctor and ask for something, do not suffer in silence, of course there are going to be folk with negative reviews about Escitalopram, but you can get negativity about anything it's helping me, I am sure and to lift that cloud and see the sun coimng through a bit is worth it ladies.

I dont have hot flashes but can feel that anxiety is much worse. I am 49 and had irregular periods for over a year. First time it happended I was bleeding for 3 weeks then was treated with hormones in order to stop it. After that was regular for couple of months, then again the same story. Had 10 days of bleeding recently then stopped but was happy only for a week, as it now started again. Went to doctor who checked me with ultra sound, my endometrium is 2 sm thick and he said i need to have D&C asap. I am abroad at the moment and it cost a lot here. So, I dont know what to do, I dont know if it is necessary to have it done. Have anyone familiar with this treatment? Thanks"

I am done with these symptoms, I am no longer me, anxiety has taken over, I have no joy de vivre! My moods are low, I am freezing on the inside, like a shiver through your whole body, then I am ripping my sweater off. I can't think straight, I easily overwhelmed, I had from any social encounter, I hate myself. Sex feels like sandpaper and everythings is drying up. Try to explain that to your husband, He's got to feel a little rejecting and insecure/ Its so painful I can't do it, I am plagued by urinary tract infections every time we use a lubricant. Or nothing they are just back to back urinary tract infections, lack of estrogen so I've read. My doctor gave me estrace 2mg, I came home and go scrared. I am 50 years old and they say the younger you start the less risks. He doesnt seem to be concerned and says he will monitor me closely. My confusion is when do you need both hormones? I have to revisit him obviously with all my questions? I still have a uterus, no period because I had and endometrial ablation. Then I started to use progestrone cream giving by a naturopath thinking he knows better than my gyne. What a mistake that was, my anxiety was through the roof, I developped acne, irritable, and I got my period again when i stopped. Great! Oh and the most painful periods in a very long time. Then I reasearch never take progestrone cream alone it really messes up hormones. My god I have to be a doctor. Going back to see gyne with all my questions, feel like I can trust him, and will try the hrt. I can't go on like this , I have to live my life Hope this helps, my heart goes out to any of you who suffer the sam If anyone is on hrt and can tell my some great benefits, energy, no more painful sex, Please Please share Click here to view image Thanks Nicole"

I had a dermoid cyst, my right ovary and the fallopian tube removed last December, by keyhole surgery, and have felt good ever since. However, two days ago I started to get mild period pains and have had slight bleeding ever since.  I now have a stitch-like pain in my left lower abdomen. My GP, who I saw this morning, has referred me urgently to a gynaecologist.  But I wondered if anyone else had had these symptoms and what their diagnosis was?  I haven't got any other symptoms and feel generally well."

Liz1980,2014-09-07T22:12+00:00,Post menopausal bleed & Strep B,"Hello,  My mum is 55 and has gone through the menopause. However, last week when we were on holiday, she had a bleed on one day. Prior to that she had 4 days of discharge and after she had a blood tinged greeny discharge with no odour which is still happening. When she went to the doctor she didn't really say what it could or couldn't be but did say that it is very uncommon for post menopausal bleeding which panicked my mum.  The doctor did a smear and took swabs and said that she could see that there was blood still and she bled some more with the smear.  She had one set of results and apparently she has strep b but this wasn't likely to cause bleeding. Has anyone with strep b had any blood/bloody discharge?  I'm riddled with anxiety as to what it could be - I've searched for ages on the internet and loads of things are coming up that it is cancer.  Has anyone had anything like this before? Any help or advice would be so appreciated.  The symptoms she's had are greeny discharge/ blood/ pelvic pain/back pain and a sort of odd stomach twinge.  Has anyone had these symptoms before with strep b? Please help!    Thank you"

I'm feeling very jittery and anxious today....is it possible that I'm feeling withdrawl symptoms?

I should add that I took this same medication last year for a longer period of time, and had no issues when I stopped taking it last November....or could what I'm feeling now be some sort of wacky delayed withdrawl?

I went for hysteroscopy appointment last week but was unable to go through with it as it was too painful, I tried to relax but it became unbearable, so now have to have it under a general anaesthetic,  I am having a biopsy as my womb lining is 10cm and they told me it should only be 5cm, has anyone else experienced this? I had gone just over a year without a period, then started bleeding so went straight to the doctor who then sent me for an ultrasound and discovered the thickening, I am so afraid that it's cancer, I can't stop worrying about it."

It's reassuring to know that others feel just as cr@p as me :-) Is anyone else experiencing low energy levels?  I don't have the inclination or the energy to do normal things like cooking and cleaning anymore.  I always feel tired.  I sleep well at night, so it's not that.  I've lost all interest.

jayneejay,2014-08-25T21:57+00:00,Vitamin E Benefits for Peri / Menopause,"useful Info  Enter a New Age With Ease Sail Through Menopause With a Little B and E One of the most important factors to consider is vitamin E. Research has shown that for 50 to 75 percent of women, vitamin E is the most practical and effective treatment for uncomfortable signs of menopause, especially hot flashes, but including nervousness, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness and insomnia. Vitamin E contains small amounts of estrogen and is essential for the proper functioning of the blood and for the production of estrogen, which may explain why it helps decrease or eliminate hot flashes. Vitamin E has the ability to relieve vaginal dryness and painful intercourse. It also enhances oxygen utilization in the body and stimulates immunity against cancer of the cervix, breasts, lungs, skin, digestive tract and rectum, which alone are sufficient reasons to use it. The preferable formulation is the natural form of vitamin E, the d'alpha-tocopherol type, as this is at least 36 per cent more biologically potent than synthetic E (called dl-alpha). Dr Leslie Packer, a professor of molecular biology at the University of California, states that synthetic E contains only one-eighth the amount of alpha-toco-pherol as natural vitamin E. When taking vitamin E, start with 200 to 400 IU daily and then gradually increase the dosage to 800 IU; 1,200 IU or 1,600 IU daily. It may take two to six weeks before you notice a difference, so give it time to work. Many doctors now recommend eliminating caffeine from your diet and taking 800 IU of vitamin E daily to reduce the condition known as fibrocystic breasts. Taking selenium, 200 meg daily, along with the vitamin E may enhance its effect on decreasing breast lumpiness. Another study stated that vitamin E, taken in doses of 100 IU or more a day, reduced heart disease by up to 66 percent. Vitamin E is found most abundantly in unprocessed vegetable oils, including sunflower, safflower, soybean and corn oil, nuts and seeds, leafy green vegetables, dried beans, whole grain cereals and breads and toasted wheat germ as well as in some fruits. Vitamin B's...  Consider The  Mega B 100mg time realease capsule which includes 100mg B6 etc in the complex capsule.. The vitamins that make up the B complex play a key role in maintaining health during the menopausal years. They are necessary for strong adrenal glands, a healthy nervous system and the conversion of carbohydrates into the glucose we need for energy. Vitamin B, keeps the mucous membranes healthy, including those of the vagina. It is also an antioxidant, especially in collaboration with vitamin C. It helps alleviate memory loss, decreases sensitivity to noise, improves concentration, relieves depression and corrects loss of appetite. Good sources of Bx are whole cereals, beans, potatoes and nuts. B2 is responsible for the release and activity of a variety of hormones, including estrogen. It also helps keep skin, nails and hair healthy. Good sources of B2 are milk and eggs. B12 lifts depression, reduces anxiety, helps decrease mood swings and eliminates fatigue. Vegetarian sources containing significant amounts of B12 include several seaweeds such as arame, wakame and nori, as well as pickles, sauerkraut, tempeh, tamari, miso and B12-enriched soy products. Animal-derived sources include eggs, milk and fish. Food supplements rich in B12 are blue green algae, chlorella, barley green and spirulina. B6 (pyridoxine) is a natural diuretic which is effective in reducing water retention. It is useful to reduce bloating that can appear before your period. It helps prevent depression and promotes calm moods and restful sleep. It also interacts with estrogen in the body. This vitamin is found in most foods and a deficiency is fairly rare, however hormone therapy can deplete the body's levels of B6 and decreased levels can lead to depression. Niacin (vitamin B3) helps with the body's production of estrogen and other sex hormones. It reduces blood cholesterol, dilates blood vessels and is sometimes prescribed to prevent premenstrual headaches. It may improve insomnia, nervousness, confusion, anxiety, memory loss, irritability, apathy and depression. If you're using B vitamins to help prevent hot flashes, be sure to use the form of niacin called niacinamide. Other forms of niacin dilate the blood vessels, which can cause flushing and worsen hot flashes, rather than relieve them. Folic acid helps the body manufacture and use estrogen. It helps reduce forgetfulness, soothe irritability, correct insomnia and promotes the formation of healthy red blood cells, which is why a deficiency of this vitamin can lead to anemia. It may help prevent precancerous changes in the cervix. A deficiency of folic acid has been associated with depression. Sources of folic acid include green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and peas."

madcow1964,2014-08-24T10:43+00:00,Sudden weird momentary weakness in right arm - ANOTHER peri symptom??,"Ok ladies - I've been following all your chats about odd peri symptoms for ages now, ticking off some of them for myself but most of them only manifesting lightly - if that makes sense! Not a lot of what I say DOES make sense these days! Anyway, I have just been doing nothing more strenuous than washing up, then I carried my mug of coffee over to the computer and sat down. Picked the mug up with my right hand, as usual, and it suddenly felt too heavy to lift! Okay, so it's a craftsman's mug by Denby - never lightweight creations - but this is ridiculous! I've just had to use both hands to drink the rest of the coffee (I'm an avid tea-drinker, but I have a coffee on a Sunday morning coz it tastes like the right thing to do - along with a bacon and egg butty for brunch!). My background is I am fast approaching 50 in a few weeks but my periods are regular as clockwork, lasting between 7 and 10 days - spotting for a few days, excruciating pain and flooding for a day or so, then back to spotting - pretty normal for me. I was getting the random hot flushes up to last year but now it's random night sweats that have only my chest drenched (is that normal - just the chest?). The worst of symptoms is brain fog and confusion - and, for the past so many weeks, dreadful unexplained fatigue, whether I sleep through the night or not! Sometimes I get the odd dizzy spell, usually lasting mere seconds, but it can leave me feeling washed out and woozy, like migraines used to. Bouts of depression - those have been going on for a few years now, but life has been difficult anyway, so not necessarily peri. Been very down and weepy the last couple of days though not so bad today. By my reckoning I am about at ovulation time - had very sharp stabbing pains in the nether regions for a couple of hours on Friday - could have been related. Anyway, that's me at the moment! Not on any pills or supplements (can't afford anything at this moment in time!) yet, though have some Fluoxetene for when things get bad enough to risk them! Anyone else getting the odd and temporary bout of weakness? Oh, and my teeth can randomly hurt - like an electric shock when I bite something hard - but my dentist says everything is fine!"

jayneejay,2014-08-22T21:43+00:00,Vitamin E benefits and peri / Menopause ' for hot flushes / vaginal dryness etc,"Just ordered some, to try out...  Vitamin E This is an important vitamin to consider at the menopause. Over many years clinical studies have shown its effect on reducing hot flushes. Vitamin E is also helpful for vaginal dryness and one study showed that just 400iu taken daily for between 1 and 4 months helped 50 percent of the women given supplemental vitamin E. Although most women fear breast cancer, our biggest killer is heart disease. There is now such a wealth of information on the beneficial effects of nutrition on heart disease and unfortunately HRT has been shown to increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. A study published in the Lancet showed that 2000 patients with arteriosclerosis (fatty deposits in the arteries) had a 75 percent reduction in their risk of heart attack when given vitamin E. At the time, researchers claimed that vitamin E was even more effective than aspirin in reducing heart attacks. Jay xx"

jayneejay,2014-08-19T16:46+00:00,High Blood Sugar during Peri & Menopause ..,"Did you know that if you are going through menopause it could be impacting blood sugar levels? This happened to me three years ago during peri menopause, after a fasting blood sugar bllod test, told borderline type 2 diabetes, so, I have to monitor regularly, no family history of diabetes, and not over weight...  all in order now, it was peri causing it... but I was not aware until the blood test. Yes, it's true! Your female hormones, estrogens and progesterone affect your cells' sensitivity to insulin. So if you thought as your menopausal symptoms have gotten worse your blood sugar levels have also become less predictable, you are not crazy, it is true. Why does one of your health conditions affect another? It is happening because our hormones impact  There are three different estrogens which are produced mainly in the ovaries each month that we have our menstrual cycle. As we move into menopause the levels of estrogen being produced in the ovaries begin to decline. Once in the blood stream, insulin travels to cells to help remove glucose from the blood so it can enter all of our cells easily. Estrogen has a protective effect on pancreas cells and prevents them from premature cell death. It also works on the cells of the pancreas to increase the production of insulin when required by certain conditions, such as diabetes. The decline in estrogen seems to cause our cells to become more insulin resistant, exacerbating blood glucose levels circulating in the body. Insulin resistance causes cells to not absorb glucose from the bloodstream as readily so blood glucose levels get higher. This causes a higher probability of exacerbating high blood sugars and diabetic complications over time. So what is the solution to this seemingly-complicated situation where menopause and diabetes co-exist in your body? If you are taking medications to control your blood sugars, whether orally or by injection, be diligent about taking them daily. It is important to monitor your blood sugar levels consistently during menopause and pay attention to lifestyle behaviors that support healthy blood sugar levels: exercise, stress management and food choices. Blood sugars can be well-maintained through a healthy whole foods diet and consistent daily exercise. So by working with a knowledgeable naturopathic doctor or health care practitioner you can keep your diabetesunder control during menopause."
jayneejay,2014-08-19T15:05+00:00,Peri & Menopause very useful explanation,"Practice Essentials Menopause is diagnosed after 12 months of amenorrhea.[1, 2] Hormonal changes and clinical symptoms occur over a period leading up to and immediately following menopause; this period is frequently termed the climacteric or perimenopause but is increasingly referred to as the menopausal transition.[1, 2] Essential update: International Menopause Society endorses new menopause toolkit The International Menopause Society has endorsed global use of a new toolkit for primary health care practitioners to more easily identify, evaluate, and manage perimenopausal and menopausal women during routine consultations.[3, 4]Physicians from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, developed the toolkit based on their clinical experience and their reviews of the literature, published algorithms, and position statements from major medical societies. The toolkit (available here) includes algorithms that cover the following[3, 4] : Reasons why a woman might present for consultation Assessment of a woman’s menopausal status Key clinical information to elicit from the patient’s medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic investigations Issues to consider that may affect treatment decision-making Hormonal and nonhormonal treatment options Individual symptomatic management on the basis of the patient’s characteristics Clinical effects During the menopausal transition, physiologic changes in responsiveness to gonadotropins and their secretions occur, with wide variations in hormone levels. Women often experience a range of symptoms, including the following: Hot flashes or flushes (most common) Insomnia Weight gain and bloating Mood changes Irregular menses Mastodynia Depression Headache The temporal pattern of symptoms is as follows: Symptoms may begin up to 6 years before the final menstrual period and continue for a variable number of years after the final menstrual period[1, 2, 5] As the postmenopause years progress, with an accompanying loss of ovarian response to gonadotropins, associated affective symptoms of menopause also decline On pelvic examination, the effects of gonadal hormone depletion (which may be noted before menopause in some women) are as follows: With loss of estrogen, the vaginal epithelium becomes redder as the epithelial layer thins and the small capillaries below the surface become more visible Later, as the vaginal epithelium further atrophies, the surface becomes pale because of a reduced number of capillaries Rugation diminishes, and the vaginal wall becomes smooth The menopausal ovary diminishes in size and is no longer palpable during gynecologic examination The uterus becomes smaller Fibroids, if present, become less symptomatic, sometimes shrinking to the point where they can no longer be palpated on manual pelvic examination In older women, a general loss of pelvic muscle tone occurs, sometimes manifested as prolapse of reproductive or urinary tract organs Urogenital effects of diminished hormone levels are as follows: A decrease in urine pH leading to a change in bacterial flora may result in pruritus and a malodorous discharge Vaginal changes often result in insertional dyspareunia Endometriosis and adenomyosis are alleviated Atrophic cystitis, when present, can mimic a urinary tract infection Menopause markers Laboratory markers of menopause include the following: An increase in serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and decreases in estradiol and inhibin are the major endocrine changes that occur during the transition to menopause[1, 2] FSH levels are higher than luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, and both rise to even higher values than those seen in the surge during the menstrual cycle The FSH rise precedes the LH rise; FSH is the diagnostic marker for ovarian failure, while LH is not necessary to make the diagnosis The large cyclical variation of estradiol and estrone observed during the menstrual years ceases, and fluctuation in levels is small and inconsequential, with the mean value being considerably lower No specific changes in thyroid function related to menopause have been found Endometrial changes Endometrial biopsy can show a range of endometrial appearances, from mildly proliferate to atrophic No secretory changes are observed after menopause, because no ovulation occurs and therefore no corpus luteum forms to produce progesterone Endometrial hyperplasia is a sign of hyperstimulation by estrogen from either endogenous sources or replacement therapy and may be a precursor of endometrial cancer Endometrial hyperplasia can also be suggested by ultrasonographic findings (ie, endometrial thickness >5 mm), which are useful for excluding hyperplasia and cancer of the endometrium in postmenopausal women Osteoporosis Bone loss accelerates in the late menopausal transition and continues for the first few years after menopause.[6] Postmenopausal women and elderly women should be treated early and on a long-term basis unless a contraindication to such treatment exists. Current treatment options for preventing fractures among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis include the following: Bisphosphonates (alendronate, etidronate, ibandronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid) Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs; eg, raloxifene) Calcium Vitamin D Calcitonin Monoclonal antibodies Hormonal medications Estrogen therapy (considered a second-line therapy for osteoporosis[7] ) Replacement therapy The main reasons for treating symptoms of the menopausal transition and actual menopause are as follows: To provide relief of vasomotor symptoms To reduce the risk of unwanted pregnancy To avoid the irregularity of menstrual cycles To preserve bone To lower the risk of disease To improve quality of life Disease risk In the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), greater safety and possible benefit from hormone or estrogen therapy for women in their 50s, with potential harm for older women, were observed with respect to the following[8] : Coronary artery disease (CAD) Total myocardial infarction Colorectal cancer Total mortality Global index of chronic diseases Although immediate use of hormone or estrogen therapy in the early postmenopausal time may reduce the risk of CAD, the WHI clearly showed that women more than 9 years post menopause should not be started on hormone therapy or estrogen therapy for CAD prevention. Administration routes for hormone therapy are as follows: Oral Transdermal Topical Vaginal route cream, ring, or tablet for vaginal symptoms Contraindications for estrogen therapy include the following: Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding Severe liver disease Pregnancy Venous thrombosis Personal history of breast cancer Well-differentiated and early endometrial cancer, once treatment for the malignancy is complete, is no longer an absolute contraindication. Progestins alone may relieve symptoms if the patient is unable to tolerate estrogens. Nonhormonal therapy In June 2013, the FDA approved paroxetine mesylate (Brisdelle) as the first nonhormonal therapy for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (hot flashes) associated with menopause.[9, 10]Next Section: Overview"

I had myself in a right panic earlier today because I've been dizzy for weeks now too and I was convinced I was having some sort of catastrophic brain event (like a stroke)....clearly, since I've felt this way since I woke up this morning, I'm probably not going to die from it, but I'm still concerned...could this be one more wacky hormonal symptom (I've had a light period for the past six days....longer than usual and it started about a week and a half after my last one (which was very light/spotty)....which was the first one I've had in two and a half months)....more importantly, how can I stop obsessing about every little thing that goes wrong with my body?

Uzume,2014-08-16T01:50+00:00,Juddering sensation in feet and lower legs?,"Hi I went through premature menopause at age 35 and I had a symptom my GP assured me was not meniopausal. It feels like a juddering in my feet, like across between a 'rumble' and a 'judder', maybe a 'buzz' would be a good description...like I would expect to feel if I lived above a tube line or something with a train going under my feet. Sometimes, it goes up the leg as far as the shin but no higher. I've experienced this on and off since menopause and it only stopped when I was on HRT, which I have now stopped using. Therefore, I am certain it must be menopause related whatever the GP days. Has anyone else felt such sensations?"

sharcerv52408,2014-08-13T18:42+00:00,Perimenopause/menopause symptoms,"What I have noticed about these symptoms is that they tend to mimick symptoms to a lot of other conditions so that is why we become alarmed when we are going through all of these changes. I too was running back and forth to the doctor only to find out that there was nothing wrong with me. As nerve wracking as all of this is, we just have to accept that this is what the change does. It will mimick a lot of other symptoms so we end up driving ourselves mad (not to mention our loved ones) with worrying and going to the doctor (not that you shouldn't go to the doctor) but I find that sometimes I can become obessesed with worrying about how I am feeling. I had to realize that no I am not having a heart attack, no I am not having a stroke, no I do not have some crazy illness, etc., but that this is all due to hormonal shifts. We will get through this."
HotDot7,2014-08-08T19:37+00:00,10 Powerhouse Foods for Menopausal Women,"1.  SOY JOY      Soy is the queen of powerhouse foods.  Researchers believe Soy offers benefits to perimenopausal women in the form of reduced menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes.  Tofu and other soy products are excellent protein, iron and calcium. 2.   FLAXSEED       Like Soy, products are a great source of phytoestrogens.  Flax packs a lot of nutrition into it's tiny teardrop shaped seeds.  A very small % of people are allergic to flaxseed.  Start with 1/4 tsp a day and call doctor if you experience allergy such as rash or shortness of breath. Flaxseed must be ground up in order for your body to absorb it's nutrients.  The oils spoil quickly, only grind enough for a few days and refrigerate what you don't use immediately. Sprinkle over cereals, salads, and soups, or mix into breads and muffins.  Bottled flax oil can be used, but heating destroys it's benefits so don't cook it. 3.  TEA FOR YOU      Green or Black teas are terrific for you.  Tea also has cancer fighting properties, fighting cell damage associated with inflammation and heart disease. 4.  EATING GREENS      Leafy green vegetables such as kale, spinach and their friends are a marvellous source of iron, fibre, vitamin C, manganese, calcium, copper, B vitamins and antioxidants. 5.  Yo! Yogurt!      A perfect source of calcium and prevent osteoporosis. 6.  Nuts to You      Nuts are a fatty food but the fats are largely unsaturated.  Nuts such as walnuts and almonds contain good for you fats, antioxidants, magnesium, vitamin E, selenium and other nutrients.  Known to fight blood clots and osteoporosis.  Chop and add to salads, pastas, stir fries, fruit dishes or just grab a few for the munchies. 7.  CATCH OF THE DAY       Fish is good for your heart and cardiovascular system.  It's high in protein. 8.  YAMS      Yams and red potatoes are terrific.  Yams are yummy, inexpensive and great source of antioxidants, vitamin C, potassium, magnesium, vitamin B6, and fibre.  Eating them regular has been linked to decrease hot flashes.  9.  BERRY BERRIES      Blueberries are high in Vitamin C and fibre.  They pack 38% more antioxidants than any other berry.   10.  ORANGES       Only about 60 calories for a medium orange and a boatload of vitamin C, fibre, antioxidants and other nutrients.   Click here to view image"

kelly-ann2308,2014-08-12T20:01+00:00,Feeling confused?!,"Today I have finally been given the diagnosis of going through the menopause after 5 months of numerous tests. I have been suffering from too many symptoms to list but have had heart scans, an endoscopy, abdominal and pelvic scans. I literally felt like I was going mad as all the test results were normal yet I knew something was wrong. My periods stopped in April and I started suffering from gastro problems and hot flushes/night sweats. My anxieties and thoughts are at times totally irrational and I feel like I have tremors/shivers. Today's diagnosis came through my insistance on having my hormone levels checked after reading posts on this forum. On visiting the GP today, who I must say was of little help, I was told to google HRT before making a decision on whether I wanted to start taking it or not, although I am thinking maybe to follow the alternative route and try vitamins etc. I am currently taking Sage and Well Woman vits as had a feeling I was menopausal and today I have been prescribed with Calcium tablets. I really do not know where to go from here and the best supplements to take, although I have read B12? Any help or info would be greatly received. I am 39 so I know this is premature and have no family history of early menopause, however I have had the Mirena coil for 10years (always still had regular periods with this) and have read this can cause early onset. I have so many questions and have no idea where to find the answers? Thanking you in anticipation!"

I was on the third day of my period and I was feeling fine all day and then all of a sudden when I was getting ready for bed I got this pain in the back of my neck. Then my shoulders and neck felt real stiff. So I asked my husband to massage my neck and shoulders. When I got into bed I drifted off to sleep but was suddenly awakened by this panicky feeling followed by heart palpatations and then my left eye felt like it was jumping. Then I kept feeling this buzzing sensation moving around in my head. Ugh! It was the worst experience. All I could do was lie there and wait for it to pass. I hate these symptoms and can't wait for them to go away for good!

HotDot7,2014-08-09T23:48+00:00,Alcohol and Menopause,"Recently there has been lots of mixed press about the health affects of alcohol. Some reports indicate that drinking in moderation may actually have benefits for heart health, could raise good cholesterol and inhibit the formation of blood clots.  A cocktail or a glass of wine, however, can trigger and intensify your menopausal symptoms.  Alcohol temporarily increases the level of estrogen in your bloodstream , making hot flashes more likely.  A drink can also further with your ability to remain asleep at night.  There may be even more serious consequences of drinking alcohol if you're taking hormone replacement therapy.  Findings from the Nurse's Health Study indicate that for those on HRT, consuming even one and a half drinks a day makes your risk of breast cancer 30 percent higher than it is for women who don't drink alcohol at all.  Here are some tips.... 1.  If you don't drink, this is not the time to start. 2.  If you do drink, moderation is the key.  Limit to one drink a day. 3.  Consider substituting a healthier beverage for booze at least some of the time. Seltzer or club soda, tomato or fruit juice, iced tea, or smoothies are thirst quenching and can be just as festive--good for your spirits as well as your body.

I have a good argument really because I had a kidney transplant and have to keep my blood presser down or I could loose my kidney.

AVR1962,2014-08-01T06:53+00:00,Bad Weeks,"I am 51 and at the doc's suggestion I went off the Pill 3 months ago. She suggested this a year ago but let me stay on and asked to to read on blood clots in women over 50. It scared me, chances of blood clotting jumps sigificantly after 50. My body had to adjust to having no daily hormones, I immediately started retaining water, gained 5 lbs in water weight and could not figure out how to get rid of it, I was miserable. For the past year I will skip a period and then the next one will be a gully-washer which might last 10 days, even when I was on the Pill which was another reason I decided to stop taking it. I have done real well with anxiety, not having any trouble controlling my irritibility, until this week my B6 and B12 combo has helped my fatigue, I have dealt with a great deal of breast tenderness which I use vit E and evening primrose oil tabs for, no night sweats and hot flashes have been mild until this week. I have never in my life experienced anything so awful! Gully washer period started this week and in the first 2 days I went thru 16 tampons, pads on top of that. I still ended up changing my clothes and doing laundry 3 times on day 2. I felt like I should not leave the house. I can see that there is alot of water mixed with the blood, lost the 5 lbs which now feels good. Never in 38 years of dealing with the monthlies have I ever soiled myself to the point of imbarrassment until this week. Hot flashes have been terrible this week too, have not been able to sleep even taking melatonin. I had lost so much blood I was light headed and seeing spots, I felt like I was going to pass out. I do take an iron supplement and last might I made sure I got a good amount of greens and protein. I was reading online that yam extract is supposed to help with the flooding periods. If anyone has tried anything else that has helped please let me know. Sideline personal rant here: Going thru this all this week I just wondered why? Why does it have to be so severe and why do women get stuck with all the painful stuff like menstruation, child birth and menopause? Perhaps the wrong set of mind but like I said it has been a hard week."

I've had no sucess in getting any number of GPs to understand my frustration. I took Prempak C for 7 yrs and decided to stop it aged 51 and try a HRT which had no break (can't remember the name) but I panicked when I couldn't stop the bleeding. The bleeding stopped instantly when I stopped taking HRT, but then I started hot flushes and feeling unwell, so I tried again and the same thing happened. My doctor told me that I can go back to Prempak C or have nothing. I chose nothing. Now, 14 yrs later, I still have unbearable hot flushes, plus constant muscle fatigue and no bladder control. I've tried Seratonin and Clonidine without success. I take a prescription co-codomol to help with my muscle fatigue, which helps me get some sleep, and have gone back once again to get my doctor's advice. She has asked me to do an online search to see what I might be interested in taking. This sounds, as many have said, that even doctors are confused by all the information there is about post menopausal symptoms. So, here I am, deciding what to try and then asking her if she agrees...."

I have been diagnosed with a mass on my left ovary which they THINK is a cyst, awaitig MRI scan but thanks to Dr Google, I have convinced myself the hip pain is due to cancer all over me!  Also sometiems my tummy feels tender, and I often feel like I am due on a period, even though not had one for 6 months - again, every symptom know I think the worst and can't get things out of my head.  Does this sound menopause related?

Guest,2007-05-03T15:54+00:00,Natural Alternative To Tibolone,"There are natural alternatives to Tibolone. Tibolone is a man made chemical which mimics the hormone estrogen, but without the build up of the endometrium. I have been taking natural hormones (not Premarin or any other patented drug) for about a year, and find that once the most suitable regime is found to suit the patient personally, it is effective. No night sweats. No mood swings. No aching joints. I live in Thailand and have been fortunate in meeting a healthcare professional who is extremely helpful and knowledgable about HRT. She has guided me and I am blessed to have met her, when I read the awful awful symptoms so many of you are suffering. I am posting here in the hope that this information will help some of you. Unfotunately, I probably have to stop taking the natural hormones (in gel or gelcap form) since I have endometriosis. And estrogen builds up the lining of the womb. It is important to shed the lining every month, but this does not mean that the whole of the linining to the womb (the endometrium) is shed. Retaining it can be bad and must be monitored. I have been to two specialists here in Bangkok, and today, finally met a US qualified and board certified specialist who really knew what he was talking about. My friend came with me to the consult. Both previous specialists told me I should have a full hysterectomy. This one (who trained at the Mayo clinic in the USA) says that is nonsense and simply not required. He is delighted that the natural gels work for me, but suggests I \""try\"" Livial for a month, to see how it goes. He said if it did not suit me, I should go back to the natural gels. My American friend who is a health professional with a Masters Degree who works in Public health, agreed. It was she who explained to me that drugs are only developed which are NOT natural products. Natural products cannot be patented. Therefore the drug giants cannot make huge amounts of money from them. Hence the horse urine extract and Premarin. But maybe their are some women who find this synthetic hormone works for them. \""horses for courses\"" (no pun intended). So, to cut to the chase, it IS possiblee to get Estrogel in the UK, which is a gel which is absorbed through the skin. It is also possible to get Progestogel which is similarly absorbed through the skin, thus avoiding having to ingest drugs. I started taking Estrogel to combat the most awful itching and night sweats (plus insomnia) and it worked in three days. What a relief! But using \""unopposed estrogen\"" can be dangerous, so then \""discovered\"" that Progesterone gel is also available. Sadly not in Thailand, but fortunately my friend got me some on a trip to Cambodia. Trials have shown that HRT absorbed through the skin is more effective than pills ingested because they do not have to pass the liver. Having suffered myself, I strongly agree that this is a problem which needs to be taken seriously. One lady says that \""we are the backbone of the community\"" and she is right. If this were a problem men suffered, I feel sure that much more would have been done about how to cope with it. If any of you ladies out there can get your hands on a copy of Mimms (used by the pharmacists in Boots and just about every other pharmacy) look up Estrogel and it will give the maker, the distributer etc. So few women in Thailand know about this that Thailand does not import it any more, but fortunately, I have access to other countries who are more enlightened. I believe the distributor of Uterogestan is French. They also are the distributors of Progestogel. Both these are absolutely natural hormones and are,at the molecular level, absolutely identical to those produced by the human body. Those who wish to Google seaarch for \""bio-identical\"" hormones. I have added this site to my faourites and hope to be of help to other ladies who are suffering. I will be returning to this site often, so if I can help further, please let me know. English Lady in Thailand"

Here I am at 51, having hot flashes, irritability that sometimes keeps me at home and away from people, I have good days when I am happy and then days I feel depressed. I am still taking the pill and my symptoms seem mild in comparison with a friend who is also going thru this. Sleep has been disrupted now for over 3 years, although in recent months it has been better. Probably my worst symptom is my irritability and I realize I have to keep my mouth shut and just allow what ever is happening around me. I have felt like leaving my husband of 22 years, when I am around friends I sometimes have to just become quiet because things they say or do will get under my skin. This last year has been hard. I have had 2 months at a time without a cycle. Right now I am just waiting for all this to be over. If anyone can lend advise I would greatly appreciate it."

Mostly I seem to manage ok but just recently I have been experiencing some strange sensations that are now starting to freak me out. I dont think you can really cause it dizziness its more a feeling of disorientation it feels as if I am not really inside myself kind of at the side of myself, I know it sounds kind of crazy doesnt it! I have a lot to deal with at the moment going through all this, working full time, taking care of my family and also caring for my elderly parents so maybe its anxiety too although I get these sensations when I dont feel anxious. I have always suffered with headaches but just recently they have got worse. I have disc problems in my neck which my doctor says explains the headaches and also the tingling I get in my head although I am not sure myself. These sensations dont seem to have any pattern they can last for a couple of hours or more and then sometimes just pass in the blink of an eye. As strokes run in my family it just worries me that I could be heading for one myself. I also suffer with a lot of aching muscles and joint pain which I find really annoying.

I am now experiencing hot flashes again and sleepless nights dryness etc. I am a young 55 and went through the menopause experience at 52. I supplemented with a testosterone pellet in November and it helped the low libido dryness etc. I am concerned however if the testosterone pellet made my ovarian cyst grow so large and so fast. My doctor said that it would not do that. My Dr gave me the miniville patch to try on my followup visit with him and asked me about my symptoms. I only have one ovary now so I was ok with giving it a try. When I went home I did my research and found information that estrogen has some pretty bad symptoms.I am now not so sure I want to supplement with estrogen after reading the experiences of other women on it.

msalhalli,2014-01-05T10:29+00:00,Anxiety and Stress? Or onset of menopause?,"I am a 46 year old mother of four. I was sterilized 13 years ago. I have always had relatively heavy periods, but regular every 26 days. I am no stranger to PMS, mainly breast tenderness and irritability ten days to a week before. 5 years ago I was diagnosed with endometriosis after exploratory surgery. I sought medical advice as my blood loss had become very clotty. No other presenting symptoms. As the condition was manageable, I didn't elect to go for any medical intervention. I also suffer from psoriasis of the scalp. After much trial and error I now control this with coconut oil. This has been on going since my mid twenties. Both of the above medical conditions act as a barometer to indicate my stress levels. And so it remains. Recently I have undergone significant levels of stress. Two of my children have left home, one to live on the other side of the world, my mother has been undergoing treatment for cancer and my father is too immobile to care for her entirely. I am preparing to move house having just gone through the whole house sale rubbish. I run my own business which is feeling the recession, plus I am in a relatively new relationship. I am still a mum to two teenage boys, who are also feeling the effects of siblings moving on and who obviously look to me for continuing support. I accept all of this and get on with it, however I appreciate it is a mother load, which has recently been reflected in the above two medical conditions. However, I have recently begun to suffer with insomnia. A normal nights sleep over the past four months has been less than four hours a night, with no set four hours. Ie I can sleep when I go to bed and wake at 3, or I can not fall asleep until then. Or it can be entirely broken and sporadic. I am familiar with relaxation techniques and have tried these to no avail. I am knackered. Since Christmas, I have had a cold, a stomach upset and now a boil has appeared in the middle of my psoriasis. I don't think this is surprising. Everyone is suddenly an expert, my mother and my partner suggest I am menopausal. My doctor also said the same without conducting any tests whatsoever. I have no other presenting symptoms, no hot flashes, night sweats, irregular periods, weight gain etc. As all the experts in my life point out, irrational thought is a symptom, so I am interested to see what others think. For the record, I don't feel irrational."

I have always been positive and optimistic til recently, but suddenly everything seems to be getting on top of me and I am finding it hard to cope, when I am used to being so self sufficient and independent. My mum had hot lushes - I don't sweat but feel as though I am on fire from the inside at night, but it is the emotional fragility I can't understand. I have always been able to handle things, and now find my stomach tightening into knots over little things, and generally feeling overwhelmed. I was getting irate easily a few months ago, lacking patience - now I just feel out of control and a vulnerable mess who has lost her self confidence - not so good when you work in sales and need to train others to be bold!

Miss_Kitty,2013-04-08T12:38+00:00,Mood Swings and heightened PMT issues,"Hi All, First post for me..... I'm 47 and for the last few (6+) months I have noticed that my mood swings are ricidulous. Each day can be completely different - lots of tears and misery - unable to maintain any real feelings of happiness or joy. It feels like living in an emotionally volatile place and it's exhausting. My cycle is getting shorter - last 2 have been 20 days and initially horrendous but lasting only really a couple of days. I have a fairly ample bosom and the pain that I experience for the best part of each month now due to swollen and tender breasts is dreadful. I don't want to take my bra off at night. My sex drive has nose dived, which is hard for me having always been very active in that way. I don't feel sexy at all and have no energy. I have also noticed that at certain times of the month I find sleep a real problem. I have always had nightmares but they seem more prevalent now and falling asleep can be really difficult on occasion. I am sure this is early symptons of menopause - would you agree and if so any suggestions on how to combat the mood swings and the sore breasts? Click here to view image Many thanks, Karen"

claire_ann,2010-05-31T23:03+00:00,Menopause!,"Hi..I am 50 years old and started menopausal symptons when I was about 42, only didnt realise. Due to problems in my relationship I put everything down to stress. However, when the periods became erratic,excessive weight gain, swollen and very tender breasts and hideous mood swings I figured something wasnt right, even took a couple of pregnancy tests!! Over a period of year I went to see 3 male doctors who all gave me a test for menopause and it came back negative. Eventually I went to see a female doctor, I knew how I was feeling wsnt right, I explained my head felt like a computer that was so messed up it needed re-booting, plus the sweats, sleep deprivation and all the other symptons. I thought she was going to think I was either a hypochondriac or a complete nutcase (I certainly felt like one), she didnt bother with tests,she straight away put me on HRT and the transformation felt amazing, I felt like someone had waved a magic wand over me and transformed me into a woman again. I took HRT for 3 years, sadly the symptons started slowly to return. However, I decided to take myself off it. I now suffer with night sweats, occasional day sweats libido is a little erratic ...but when its good its good!! My weight has returned to normal, breasts no longer hurt or look like melons! There is no magic cure the menopause and each womans experience varies. However, it is a sympton of ageing and yes it makes me feel like shit sometimes that I have got here, thought I was going to be one of the lucky ones that sailed through it. I accept now that my body has gone through changes and will never be or feel how it did when I was young, I manage the symptons and its true diet does help, reducing the alcohol helps with the night sweats , Nitol helps with the sleep and plenty of water helps the skin look brighter ...sweating really dehydrates....The one good thing is woman are more confident to talk and be open about it...which has helped me...There are no quick cures...no idea when the symptons will finish..I was talking to a lady of 80 the other day who still suffers with nights sweats...yippee!! It does get a little easier and for me the early days when I just thought I was a crazy lady as I didnt know what was happening were the worst....so there are some lovely and understanding gp's out there and the 'Well Woman' clinics.....and for anyone who fills like pooh at the moment......It will improve....eventually!"
Guest,2005-09-11T12:42+00:00,The menopause arrived on June 1st this year and wiped me...,"The menopause arrived on June 1st this year and wiped me out. I suffered total exhaustion and could hardly walk. Confusion, an inability to function mentally and an inability to control my blood glucose levels were all significant factors. The process of determining what the matter was also highlighted an inability to control my blood glucose levels and this added to the state I was in. In desperation, I turned to chinese medicine. They diagnosed the menopause, gave me a course of acupuncture and follows this with a course of herbal remedies called Kun Bao Wan. It took two weeks to work, but gradually strength returned, hot flushes, night sweats stopped and I felt much more positive about life. Recently I stopped taking the remedies as I felt so good and to see what would happen. Within 5 days I was back to the old symptons, also reacting badly to sugar. It has taken me a week to get back up again. So, I feel I have found a solution to my problem and I can honestly say I have not felt as well as this for years. Everyone has noticed it too. Someone I work with said: It has been like knowing someone in black and white and then meeting them for the first time in colour. I would unreservedly recommend Chinese remedies for the menopause.

Lesley998,2012-08-27T21:52+00:00,A Letter To My Ovaries on Your Retirement,"Just to make you laugh in all this hell. A letter to my Ovaries (and Hormones) - on your Retirement Dear Ovaries How well I remember the day the two of you first started working for me. It was not a good start. You were young and restless, and egged on by your friend Hormones, you first suddenly appeared as crop of spots on my face... with an overtime bonus of hairy legs and greasy hair. Soon you matured and were taking on extra hours, working late into the night to change my childish, happy smiling nature into something altogether more evil. Oh yes, I laugh now when I remember how, if you were deprived of your bonus, or even your lunch break, I would resemble Linda Blair in the Exorcist. And hah! How quickly I forget the wonderful moments..... the day you all organised for the Tit Fairy to arrive, and the glorious time I was briefly visited by Slim, Hourglass Figure and Glowing Youthful Skin. After a bumpy start, we all settled into a good working rout ine, and would only cross swords as you took turns to bombard me once a month. Then, after a number of uneventful years while you stuck to your faithful routine - you Ovaries took a long break while I had my first child. (And thank you Hormones, for working long hours to keep everything ticking over in their abcence.) Fast forward to a couple of years ago, when our happy comfortable working life started to show the first cracks. You would often take a few days off work without asking permission. Then you would turn up for work, late or drunk. It seemed that you just didn't care. Soon, the abcences turned into weeks. The Temp agency sent 'Weepy', 'Tired', 'Fat' and 'Sweaty' to fill in, even 'Joint Pain' came for a few months - but it didn't work out. Then they tried to send in all the other 34 'Helpers' too....including 'Dry Skin', 'Saggy Arse', 'Wrinkles' - even 'Flushy', and 'Missing Libido'....but we had to face facts. You were all tired out, and it was time for us to part. So tonight, as I bid you farewell and reflect on all you have done for me, I want to thank you. Thank you for faithfully releasing that egg every month for all those years without so much as a nod of acknowledgement from me. Thank you that, knowing you were reaching the end of your useful working life, you briefly came back and put on a burst of extra activity, even if it did mean I went a little loopy and almost got divorced. All of that that is behind us now. Yes, I even forgive you for 'Changed Body Odour', who you presented as one last final hellish replacement. And as you leave the building and switch off the lights....may I just ask you one last favour. Don't ******* come back."

On next gynae appt (3months into my 6 months of treatment) I told her about hot flushes and stoppin livial and she firmly recommended restartin livial for protection against osteo/heart disease/hot flushes. I have taken it for a month, felt OK at the beginning but am now feeling like an old woman - I'm 41! and the pain in my hips/lower is constant and crippling.

Guest,2008-12-09T12:28+00:00,skin problem on Tibolone,"Hi I started on Livial back in Feb08, following preventative surgery as I am BRCA2 cancer gene carrier and, like some others on here, had few options as to dealing with flushes, bone health etc. I am 40 years old. I have developed quite a bit of facial hair, which is annoying, and my head hair seems to be falling out, so much is coming out all day long. But I have developed one body change that is really making my life a misery, and wondered if anyone else had experienced this - or if it isn’t linked to the Livial (as my doctor believes): Around April I remember my clothes started to feel a bit tight around the armpits, and so got little red marks when wearing the more fitting clothes. Slowly I have bought/worn bigger and bigger. It took a few months for me to realise that it was so much an increase in size, but sensitivity – each armpit now has two patches of sometimes sore, sometimes itchy skin. For the last 3 months I have been on a merry-go-round of visiting my doctor – differing diagnoses – impetigo, intertrigo, eczema, dermatitis – and received steroid creams, antifungal steroid creams, antibiotics; but nothing shifts it. I recently asked my GP if she thought it might be the HRT, but said it was doubtful. Has anyone else experience this? Thanks Jane"

Ive recently lost 2 stone since xmas 2007 and it has been a struggle. Im 5ft 2 and now weight 9 stone 3lbs. I was 11stone 3 lbs at christmas. Ive osteoarthritis and had a total knee replacement 2 yrs ago and ive read about the joint pains tibolone causes and weight gain, although the weight gain can be caused by fluid retention which can be controlled with a healthy diet and low salt intake etc....and taking a good dose of vitamin C as it reduces water retention, but im wondering if there is anyone who has had the injections together with the tables of tibolone and what have your experiences been with it. Im having to be put through false menopause for a 6 mth course due to a problem with PCOS (polycyctic ovarian syndrome) which causes PMS symptoms, headaches, bloating, sleepless nights, mood swings etc. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. I also understand there is testosterone in the tibolone and wondered if anyone had had any bad side effects with it, ie: facial hair, hair loss, weight gain etc... these are my main concerns, plus it can masculinise you.

jillybean,2008-03-09T19:10+00:00,MACA-alternative to tibolone/HRT,"Hi I am nearly 50 and started menopausal symptoms 3 years ago. I have just had over a year of being peiod free. I have tried several HRTs but none suited. I have tried all the herbal things, angus castus, dong quai etc. I found with Livial I put on loads of weight, had vaginal soreness, headaches, and still had hot flushes on it, it did increase libido and helped with vaginal dryness, but the cons out weighed the pro side of it. I hope this reply will help a few people. I am no 'eco warrier' who only believes in natural medicine, as I have to take thyrozxine daily. However I buy Glucosomine which I also take daily from Simply Supplements and in the brochure was something called MACA which was supposed to help with libido, so I thought I would give it a go as mine was virtually none existent. Took it for a month and what a difference! Increased libido, better moods, clearer head, less severe hot flushes and a good nights sleep. I didnt take any the following month as it is expensive, boy did know it. So I researched MACA, and if you just put in Maca in google you will find better sites to get it from. I now get it from Earthrise Foods, I take 2 900mg pills a day and 1 teaspoon of maca powder on cereal. It is totally organic and is just like a vegetable grown in Peru. You can use the powder in cakes even, it is just a food supplement. Would be interested to hear of anyone else using it. jillybean :D"

Guest,2006-05-24T12:03+00:00,Very interesting reading all the letters. The problem i...,"Very interesting reading all the letters. The problem is that conventional HRT contains oestrogen and progesteron - and maybe some of you like me cannot tolerate the progesteron part of hrt - therefore we have been offered Livial. When i started it there were not a lot of trials and it was just on the market, but now i see that a lot of the symptoms i have seem to be related to Livial. Problem now is that if you come off it and have flushings every 20 mins day and night what do you do?Obviously you go back on the Livial and just tolerate the side effects. This i have done 4 times now as gp can offer nothing else to help the fliushings. I am presuming that there are a few ladies in the same circumstances as I am. My worst problem is that i have muscle pain related to fibroymalgia/me, and my skin is dreadful (not nice to be in your 50's with acne). Also when i went onto Livial re consultant at hospital derm. department i was told i may have to stay on it for life! as i am not making Oestrogen at the appropriate level needed for health and cannot tolerate progesteron. I had Oestrogen patches which i felt were wonderful, but they can cause cancer problems so i was taken off and put onto the livial. Anyone else having acne related to Livial? I have now contacted Livial directly and my gp is going to contact them himself and see what the latest trials say about long term problems (over 10 years on this medication). Oh to be a man and not have all this menopause problems. [i:11c870a443]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:11c870a443]"

Everything was fine for 8 weeks then the hot flushes and night sweats started. I have not had a decent night's sleep for weeks. My doctor told me that if I stayed on HRT until I was 80 years old the flushes would still get me as I was only postponing them. was unaware of this. She suggested a herbal remedy, Soya or Black Cohash. They have not worked so far. This week I have bought, from a local health store a supply of Flash Fighters. I am taking the procribed dose of three a day and hope they work. I will update you when I have have succeeded in finding a cure.

Guest,2007-04-28T19:03+00:00,Hot Flushes,"Peri-meno started 3 years ago. Ferocious hot flushes day and night. No periods for 19 months but still suffering flushes/sweats though toned down marginally, they show no sign of stopping or reaching a level I can live with. Off to GP to ask for VERY low dose Venlafaxine - have read a bit about that on the Menopause Amarant Trust website as don't want HRT. Fine while you're on it but with the more modern 'lowest dose, shortest time' method of prescribing it just delays the process. No-one seems to explain that when you come off it the symptoms return. You do not 'bypass' the meno, just give your body the hormones it needs by a different method when you no longer produce your own. So what would you expect to happen when you stop the patch/pill regime! Same as when your body became oest/prog deficient - meno symptoms. Spoke to someone who had been on it 15 years before GP refused to let her have any more in 2002 following research 'scare'. She's had meno symptoms since then and feels previous 15 years was a bit pointless. I want something non-hormonal which might take the 'edge' off flushes while my body adjusts to it's new seriously depleted oest/prog state."

I had been having symptoms of the menopause for several years theses symptoms got worse about 18 months ago, i felt i did not want to risk HRT because of my family connections with cancer, so i tried acupunture together with chinese herbs, the results were amazing. I did wondered if my hormones were fluctuating and the results were coincidence, so i stoped partly because the treatment was costing me £50 per week! After a few months the symtoms were back and worse than ever, i went to my GP and agin were told the protential risks i felt the NHS really could not offer me anything, i decided to try the chinese medicine again the results were again amazing i opted not to have the acupuncture because of the costs. So i take Zhi Bai Di Huang Wan and Kun Bao, the cost is appox £15 per week and this gives me conplete releif of hot flushes/ night sweats and releif of vaginal dryness, because i am sleeping better my mood has impoved. My only worry is what are in these tablets and what the possible side effects are!

Guest,2006-01-05T05:17+00:00,I have recently been prescribed Livial as an improvement...,"I have recently been prescribed Livial as an improvement for an HRT product which had been giving me headaches. I am now in my fourth month of use. I have not found Livial to be very effective in combatting hot flushes or night sweats, only lessening them slightly in severity and frequency. Over the past few months I have had increasing joint pain and fluid retention (even unable to make a fist first thing in the morning). My ankles and wrists ache and even my toes are stiff. I didn't immediately consider Livial as the culprit but thought I was developing arthritis at an alarming rate at only 57! I have almost decided to wean myself off Livial as it seems pointless to continue with something that is turning me into an 'old person'. I would be interested if anyone else has experienced this and if there is another solution.

I have been using Livial for the past three years and feel I have benefited from it. Prior to using Livial, took many other forms of HRT, but had constant breakthrough bleeding, this was investigated and it was then suggested I try Livial. The bleeding stopped, the libido greatly improved along with a general sense of wellbeing. I am 73 years of age. It would be interesting to hear about any positive comments from others.:lol::lol::lol: [i:a568488a65]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:a568488a65]"

I was prescribed Livial after suffering from a severe lack of libido and feeling depressed. I wish I had never started taking it I was always a steady 10 stone 3-7lbs I have since shot up to nearly 12 stone, I have taken up running and eat very healthily and I still can not shift the excess weight. All in all my sex life is out of the window as I feel so fat and unattractive and I am depressed as I can not fit into any of clothes and need to buy size 16 clothes. I have also suffered from shoulder and hip pain since taking Livial. I have of this week thrown them in the bin, with a view to visiting my GP and asking for a testosterone implant and a gel for dryness. I would rather suffer from the dreaded hot flushes. Women survived without HRT years ago so i am sure i can. ::yikes: [i:6eba3664ec]This message was automatically imported from the original Patient Experience[/i:6eba3664ec]"
