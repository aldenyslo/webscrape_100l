Guest,2019-06-05T10:11+00:00,Celiac disease and perimenopause....get tested!,"hello ladies i just wanted to warn all of you ladies out there who are struggling with the symptoms of perimenopause and memopause, please get tested for celiac disease or sensitivity! I am waiting on my results now and when i did research on gluten issues i was blown away by the symptoms. It mirrors alot of the perimenopausal symptoms drs think we are making up and it can cause early menopause. Most people probably wont have the disease or gluten sensitivity but it doesnt hurt to get tested to see. Your life and mental well being may be saved in the process."
Gypsy014,2019-06-01T15:37+00:00,Vestibular Migraines,"Hello ladies as many of you know the off balance dizzy feelings during peri and menopause are actually vestibular migraines aka MAV (very common) during menopause.. For all the ladies who only suffer from the off balance dizziness thank your lucky stars that you don't have the full on migraine attacks with it, as you can have these migraines silent or not, imagine having the dizziness off balance along with the full on migraine attack, it literally leaves you disabled can't do anything stops you in your tracks!! Just wanted to hear from the ladies who suffer both and if you have the full migraine attacks do you get the numbness on one side of your body , and also ive been getting the ocular migraine attack with my migraines they alternate, and leaves the one eye very blood shot red in only the one eye. Do any of you get this as well.. Hopefully everyone is feeling good today!!"

I understand they are used for migraines but my doctor said they should help with the release of pressure. Does anybody use this medicine? She also recommended that i put peppermint on my temples... That did seem to work a little. Also, for the nausea and loss of appetite I sucked on some Gin-Gin, hard ginger candy found at Whole Food Stores and I finally ate something yesterday because early that morning I had no appetite and felt horrible. My dr says I have severe anxiety and thats my biggest issue. UGH! We know our bodies!! Lets see how these things work. Something has got to ease all this craziness!!!"

I have had abdominal pain and lots of gurgling sounds, wind and a complete fullness in the upper abdominal area for going on two weeks now with little or no relief. I have had this in the past for short periods of time but this is the longest. I may also mention I just had my cycle after 40+ days and this started about a week before. This period is very light and almost non existent (just enough to aggravate you lol). Anyone else had it last this long. I have tried Apple cider vinegar, gas x, ranitidine just to name a few with little relief. The pain is gone but the bloat and fullness (almost causes breathlessness) is still holding on. Any encouragement would be greatly appreciated.. This peri is no joke."

charcey97,2019-05-31T21:08+00:00,Word finding?,"How many of you with Peri in your 40s have issues with word finding? Some days are better than others, but for the last couple of years, I have had issues being able to find the proper words in a conversation. especially when I am nervous or when I am doing something out of the ordinary like a presentation. I find myself stuttering as I‚Äôm trying to search for the word which is usually a very simple word that I should be able to find. There is some days it happens several times a day and some weeks it only happens a couple times a week. at times, I will even put a similar word in that does not make sense in the conversation at all. Four instance, I might say ""put the milk in the cupboard"" instead of ""put the milk in the refrigerator"". It‚Äôs very unnerving, and makes me feel like I‚Äôm getting early dementia or something. Anyone else find this issue haunts them?"

Lately my periods have been very heavy but not pain full. I started to feel dizzy yesterday which again for me is normal but now i also feel like my legs are like jelly. So now i have a combo of dizziness dry mouth jelly legs and feeling very tired. Has anyone had these symptoms on day 2 and 3?

shylee,2019-05-17T09:31+00:00,"Peri and Burning throat, tongue and face","I can't find anyone who is having the same or similar burning throat, tongue and face symptom as me. I have a lot of other symptoms as i have shared before but would like to focus on just these right now. I have noticed the burning increases just before and through a cycle when it comes and as it ends. The burning throat is like having a really bad throat infection that never gets better but has flare ups, but there is No actual bacteria etc...... The tongue is burning mouth syndrome which feels like i have stuck my tongue in Boiling water. My face feels like its bursting with heat that wont go away, unlike the flashes that rise and fall, and a prickling under the chin.... my neck feels tight...... i'm having palpitations through my neck but no anxiety really...... I just want to cry because its all just too much, years and years of it . And i cant cry because i will get another migraine..... If i didn't have grandchildren I'm sorry to say but i wouldn't be here. I know that's a defeatist attitude, but right now i don't care. Is there anyone else out there suffering with this incredibly full on symptom?"
Guest,2019-05-31T23:40+00:00,Anyone else have mouth changes?,"i have weird question for everyone, do any of you all of the sudden notice you lose your sense of taste for salt or sweet and your mouth feels like there is a slippery coating with your tongue feeling kind of fluffy? Similar to when the numbness starts to wear off after a dental procedure. I have been dealing with the strange taste issue for 2 years and now i havent had a period since the beginning of February. But the strange tongue and mouth thing is beyond strange! During this time im generally nauseous and lightheaded and it will last for a couple of days then it wears off and i start feeling like i can eat again. Its driving me crazy! I noticed a strange mouth early in my pregnancies but nothing like this!"

She prescribed Vagifem, Yes VM, low dose Amitriptyline which were prescribed by my GP and have really helped. She also prescribed 4% Aqueous lidocaine to be used prior to sexual intercourse to ease the pain but my GP was unsure how to prescribe this so sent a query to the surgery pharmacist who two weeks later prescribed Vagisil 2% medicated cream which I dont think is the correct thing. Has anyone used 4% Aqueous lidocaine to ease the pain of sexual intercourse and if so how was it prescribed? and how to you use it. Thanks for your help and advice."

I've been on it a week and I've had two. Not even two a day, but two. I can sleep at night without waking up to throw off the covers, no night sweats. I didn't see that coming, but it's so much better. For those who battle both, it's worth investigating."

So i was diagnosed with ibs 2 years ago and that was the start of my journey. Fast forward 2 years for the most part I have been symptom free I had to change my diet remove dairy certain foods are a no go. Well i hadnt had a period in almost 2 months then i finally had one. It went on wo a hitch i bled for about 9 days with another 2 days of spotting. About i would say 4 days after i started to feel unwell. Dizziness aching and sore muscles stiff neck. I don't need to tell you ladies you no the deal. Then my stomach started to act up it been a few days now and it is my ovulation week with yesterday being my highest pregnancy day lol..no babies here. Now to my question. I have had a gurgling stomach with a tremendous amounts of gas . Slight discomfort and extreme bloating in upper part of belly. pressure in between shoulder blades that comes and goes. And also Im having what i think is palps every once in awhile while but it feels more like a quick hard thud then done. But I've been extremely bloated so not sure if its pressure related. Just looking to hear others stories and suggestions. Sorry for the long rant just want to feel better.

WELL 16 years down the line I am ten times worse with the anxiety and depression and I have a lovely nine stones of weight on my original body ( before some smart arse says that my hands weren't tied behind my back and I was force fed I know I eat cause that's my coping mechanism.

I write this tonight cause I have a heavy heart as I am applying for a job that I am really good at and have applied three times for it and they don't reply.

susane84679,2019-05-28T14:49+00:00,WE HAVE TO TAKE CONTROL!,"Hello Ladies, I hope you all are having a good day so far.I want to start off by saying that I am in no way diminishing our symptoms or how we are feeling on any given day. This Hell we are all going thru is rough to be sure and we all struggle with many of the same symptoms. We can not let This control our lives, we cant let it dictate where and when we go somewhere. I know that several of you ladies are moms to younger children and you have mentioned how you have pretty much given up on being the mom they deserve because of how you are feeling from one day to the next. DO NOT DO THAT!! We have got to take control of our lives and not give in ( although that is the easiest thing to do) it is not easy but we are women, we are strong and we will persevere ! We have got to accept that menopause is what we are going thru, not who we are. It is a phase of our life and will not last forever. I think the most common complaint is Anxiety. I suffered with this for years before meno, until I decided it would not control me any longer. I was afraid to leave my house because of it. So, I got off the meds and started doing things I enjoyed before, it did not happen overnight but it did happen. I had to train myself to think differently and when anxiety reared its ugly head I kept moving forward and refused to let it stop me. I have not had an attack in years even going thru meno! We have to take control of our symptoms and our lives Ladies, we can not let this hell win! I know how scary and difficult this journey is because I am going thru it myself, with many of the symptoms you ladies suffer from but I have a normal life because I refuse to let it control me. I absolutely have bad days but for the most part they are good. I am not saying anything negative about how someone else is dealing because we are all different, I am just sharing my story because I want all of you to know that you can live a normal life while going thru peri/meno, but that it's up to each individual to decide when they've had enough of missing life and how they will get it back. Hope all of you have the best day ever and sending hugs to all!"

Now my lining is about 2x what they say is okay as far as cancer risk. I've been living a menopause hell. Don't see why not to just have the hysterectomy and be done? I'd like to get on bhrt (after the procedure), as I don't like the idea of horse urine (hrt), and I've decided that pellets just aren't for me. I'd rather try compounded creams or just live with the BS these golden years have become. Thank you in advance for reading this, and any words of wisdom/advice. My best wishes to all of you! Nancy"

I am still struggling with symptoms but I am trying to become more positive about this and accept my situation without loosing my hope for a miracle. The last few days, I made some thoughts about this phase of my life and I would like to share them with you and tell me your opinions if you want. Well, in the past, I used to laugh at conspiracies but with all the "" weird"" and more than normal scientific advances on nowadays I was wondering if New World Order schemes have affected women's health, hormonal imbalances, premature perimenopause with more intense symptoms than our mothers. I do not mean only chemicals in food and modern life style but I was wondering if the plethora of satellites around us along with the ability of military and space organizations even to remove and affect the conditions to other planets for their geopolitical schemes have affected the function of our bodies and may accelerate ""idiopathic"" autoimmune health problems relate to our hormones and metabolism . Not mention the vast amount of radiation that we are exposed to!!!! As you know the moon has a direct influence especially to women behavior and menstrual cycle.

I went for a gyno visit last august my first visit in 6 years due to high anxiety. She was young, when i explained all my symptoms she looked at me like i had 3 heads and asked if i talk to anyone. She said there were really no accurate tests for hormones and what im experiencing could be hormonal or stress. I wanted to lunge over the room and throat punch her, God forgive me.

At 40 I suffered my first panic attack outta no where. I went to ER. Then many times after. They put me on sertraline. A year later I went off it. Now Ive pinned down the anxiety to the day or 2 my period begins. Anyone else have this issue? I feel like a crazy hormonal lunatic. Oh and ever since I had that first panic attack at 40 I cant go into big stores or crowds. Its too much stimulation and I get anxious. 2 years ago an ENT said it was vestibular neuritis which goes away in a month. But now looking back Im thinking this has also been my crazy hormones. These have been my symptoms since age 40: Brain fog, anxiety, heavy periods, fatigue, forgetfulness, longer cycles, sore breasts more frequently, intense cramps, stomach issues. So ya I accept Im changing. It sucks. The anxiety bothers me most. It can be crippling. Anyone else experiencing this? How do u even deal with it? Thanks."

Stacy4412,2019-05-17T17:36+00:00,"Constant Dizziness/Lightheadedness - Soar, Stiff, Twitching Leg Muscles w/Tingling Sensation","Hi Ladies, I'm new to this forum. I'm so glad to find you all! Hoping some of you can relate to my story so I don't feel like I'm dying. I'm 50 yrs old and post-menopausal for 2 years now. I don't ever recall having peri-menopausal symptoms, but to some extent, I'm sure I did. However, once my period stopped I started having ""normal"" menopausal symptoms in the beginning such as hot flashes, low energy and irritability. I took the Estroven supplement and felt great for about 6 months. Then I stopped the supplement and continued to feel fine for about 6 months until one day everything changed. I woke up one day in August of 2018 and my legs felt like I had done 1000 squats!! They were sore/stiff, weak/shaky and twitching everywhere. The left side of my body had a tingling/cooling sensation from my ankles to my face. I also became extremely dizzy/lightheaded. I thought I had either MS or ALS! I started researching my symptoms and of course that made me have terrible anxiety! When I tried to sleep I felt the anxiety well up inside my body and felt a fluttering in my heart. I saw my GP and had every blood test imaginable. He found nothing, everything was perfect! However, I told him I was scared that I had MS or a brain tumor so he referred me to a Neurologist. I had an MRI and every other test imaginable...nothing, I was fine! I then thought it could be my heart or low blood flow since I was always dizzy, so I went to a Cardiologist. They did every test imaginable...nothing, I was fine! I then went to an Alternative doctor who said I probably had an auto-immune disease so they ran every blood test on me including a stool (poop) sample....except for finding out that I once had EBV (epstein barr virus - that was a shocker!)....nothing, I was fine! I then went to an ENT doctor because the dizziness was chronic and debilitating. I always felt like I was going to fall over everyday, all day! I had pressure in my head and ears and also developed Tinnitus. The doctor said I probably had Meniere's Disease and that there was really nothing I could do for it. He prescribed Valium, allergy meds and water pills but they didn't work. I took the Valium once and then got scared of becoming addicted so I discontinued it. I then remembered that my mom was super dizzy when she was going through Menopause. So I went to my Gyno and told her my symptoms but she said that dizziness wasn't a normal symptom. But because my hormone levels were so low she put me on HRT, the lowest dose. Everything started to feel better except the chronic dizziness/lightheadedness so I searched for other solutions and found an Upper Cervical Chiropractor that said my Altas (1st vertebrae) was off and that there is a connection between the Vestibular System and the Nervous System. So they corrected my alignment. It's still a work in progress but it seems to have helped a little bit with my dizziness, though, I still have Tinnitus. Also, I stopped taking HRT a few months ago because I didn't think it was helping with the dizziness BUT boy, that was a mistake because all my other symptoms have returned. My twitching, sore & achy legs are back, irritability during the day and the anxiety and hot flashes at night...UGH!! So I decided to go back on HRT a few days ago hoping for the best. Can anyone relate to my symptoms? Even though I NOW believe all of my symptoms are related to menopause, I still fear that there is something seriously wrong with me such as MS or ALS. üò¶ Sorry for the lengthy story, it's my first time telling it publicly. Thank you for reading!"

I have been on this forum many times. i have had pretty much every symptom there is, with my biggest complaint, and I was on many times , was anxiety. I must say that some of my symptoms have subsided. (fingers crossed) Of course new ones do pop up. I was wondering if others experience the very frequent urge to urinate at night that it awakens you from sleep? I do not get a regular period anymore. The last I had was some spotting many months ago. This may seem like a common question, but I havent had this happen, with the urge to urinate, since I was more regular with my periods . Thanking anyone in advance for their experiences."

For the past week I have been feeling the severe hot head, sharp quick pains in my head, nausea, appetite all over the place, stomach feels weird, sweats, weak legs, brain fog, and depression. I've lost some weight. All of this is the most horrible feeling and I've cried a few times. I walk about 3-4 times a week. I started taking Ultimate Flora 30 billion probiotic once daily, Fish Oil, Magnesium. I stop taking the vitaminD just for a few days because I was told too much is not good.

After going through mri, blood tests, cat scans, ekg, vestibular rehab therapy, and numerous numerous run of the mill tests why has it taken me over 2 years to figure it out on my own? Hormones. One simple words yet many complex symptoms. The doctors and Im talking GP, NP, physical therapists, neurologists, ents...all of them from the emergency room to the doctors office need to get educated more. Talk of perimenopause and menopause used to be taboo. Now you have so many of us suffering anxiety, depression, body changes weve never experienced and most doctors say oh its stress. Take ativan. Or depression meds. Until I came here I never realized how many of us suffer the same symptoms. Heck it was here I read others cant even go in big stores like Walmart without panicking anymore. Thats me too. Never had this in my entire life and one starts to feel crazy. I know theres no easy fix but I wish doctors would get a clue given were women and a certain age as it might be peri or menopause starting. None of them EXCEPT my obgyn mentioned it. I feel the more we make it known and let it out in the open then we can better manage our symptoms instead of playing guessing games. Im going to bring it up to every doctor I see from here out."

An FSH/LH blood test showed that I am peri/menopausal. I'm 49 and still have (unpredictable) periods. My GP prescribed Clinorette tablets but the local pharmacies say there are supply issues. The GP changed my prescription to Elleste Duet but, again, there are none available. So then he prescribed Kliovance.... and I'm sitting here looking at the patient info leaflet. It says they are for women who haven't had a period for 12 months. I have. I'm wondering whether to take them, as I'm desperate to deal with how low my mood has been, but as the 3rd choice of meds should I wait until the 1st choice, Clinorette, is available again?"

I have been bleeding, although that is slowing down now. I am wondering whether he used an instrument that was too big for me and forced his way in. That is what it feels like. I usually have the smallest speculum when I have a smear test as I find it so painful. After a couple of days I decided to have a look with a mirror to see what state I was in. I have a huge gaping hole at the entrance to my vagina when it is normally closed. My question is - will the hole close up or am I damaged for good?

Guest,2019-05-02T13:53+00:00,Not sure there is answers,"I had a hysterectomy (quarter of 1 ovary left) back in 1995, and since late teens have suffered from hypothyroidism. In retrospect I should of noticed that I wasn‚Äôt feeling the cold as much, getting hot when doing any work and waking hot in the night. In 2014 my lovely husband passed away out of the blue and for 2 years I was in complete denial. In January 2016 I began feeling really low and depressed and thought that maybe I needed some help, but before I could BOOM! I started with what I thought was a tummy bug and it all went down hill from there. Within the next 6 months I went to A&E 6 times and was MISdiagnosed with anything from crohns to overmedication of thyroxine. It was then I went to see an endocrinologist privately to sort out my thyroid, best thing I did he actually listened! Well I wasn‚Äôt overmedicated at all but he did tell me that with my age hormonal shifts can affect thyroid, it was then the penny dropped I did a bit of research, of course what an idiot I had been MENOPAUSE!! I also decided to seek help from a therapist and discovered I was also suffering from complicated grief, anxiety & PTSD, who I still see to this day. I am certainly much better now and each year gets slightly better. My symptoms of which I can remember : No appetite ‚Äì I couldn‚Äôt eat or drink much for around 6 months all I managed was ice chips and an odd bowl of rice I nibbled on crackers. I lost nearly 2 stone in this time. Bowel and stomach pain which was crippling. 24/7 Nausea just awful. Heat Intolerance- couldn‚Äôt stand heat generally, no hot showers only cold and couldn‚Äôt bear a hair dryer. Insomnia ‚Äì 1 to 2 hours sleep at best. Difficulty swallowing ‚Äì like my throat had something in it. Dry mouth. Tachycardia Diarrhoea for months on end. Weight gain -well the 2 stone I lost turned into 3 stone gained which won‚Äôt budge now. Tiredness & Exhaustion. Anxiety, Anxiety,Anxiety Oh brother! Where to begin. I turned into gibbering wreck and became agoraphobic. Chest tightness Pounding heart Restlessness Emotional/Depressive Brain fog & lack of concentration Loss of confidence even afraid to drive ( been driving over 30 years) Constant headaches Tremors and shakes both internally and externally Brain zaps. Hot Flushes & Night Sweats ‚Äì these were continual one after the other 24/7 I have probably forgotten loads. I am guessing by now I am probably post menopausal. All I can say is as time passes symptoms get a bit easier, and others disappear if only we knew which ones and when. ‚ó¶"

Now I went up to hospital on Wednesday I thought to get it removed and was told that the polyp would need to be removed by General anaesthetic but she went ahead and got her young male gynaecologist to probe where it was and get a biopsy. I will now get to my point why didn't they leave it and get it checked when they were going to remove it was this just practise for the younger doctor. This waiting for test after test has got my anxiety off the charts.

No period for 4 months then bleeding heavily for 30 days, not spotting, but bleeding. Both legs feel like flu aching, like when period began as a teen. Endometriosis history. Did not have a cycle for 4 months. Bled rectally, kind of a lot of blood and dr did exam and said had a hemorrhoid at entry of rectum. Said could be diverticulitis. Gave antibiotic. A few days after on antibiotic, began bleeding vaginally, after no period for 4 mths. Ultrasound over a few days showed wall thickened from 11 to 14 in one week in from 2nd week to 3rd week of bleeding.. Appeared no more bowel blood after vaginal bleeding began. Saline ultrasound showed no polyps or fibroids. Biopsy completed 5 days ago. Colonoscopy scheduled in 4 days. Dr recommended hysterectomy and preferred having colonoscopy done before in case endometriosis encroached. Nurse said colonoscopy is needed bc heavy bleeding 30 days is not normal. I've read on here some people do have it for a long time after not having a period. Period history, heavy and painful periods. Always on time and no breakthrough until last couple of years and dr said it was normal to expect spotting in cycle approaching Menopause . One year ago, I was bleeding some during pap and it came back abnormal and biopsy then showed clear. HPV was done and it was negative also. Could antibiotic have triggered hormones or something to trigger shedding of uterine lining? Anyone have endometriosis during peri with heavy long bleeding?

I started post menopausal bleeding six or seven weeks ago was sent for smear that came back normal then I was sent for vaginal ultrasound which said there was a polyp and they took a biopsy of the lining of the womb that came back normal cells. They then told me I couldn't get the polyp removed under local anaesthetic so the doctor got her junior doctor to take a biopsy which was horrendous as the young man couldn't get a large cut of the polyp ( oh God did he try to the point he was hurting me) so that biopsy couldn't get cells off it to small a sample. I shall now get to my main point I have been told I can't get the polyp removed by General anaesthetic as my b.m.I. is to high in otherwards I am too fat and they can't take it out by local anaesthetic so what I want to know does anyone have any ideas ( the lovely Kerry whom I speak to on the forum suggested spinal block) what else I can get . Your help with this query would be much obliged........ Heather P.S. Can you live with polyp in there or is it best it's removed if only to stop the bleeding.

heather29740,2019-04-30T17:25+00:00,What Next ???,"Well here we go bleeding lightly for past few weeks had it checked have a large polyp. Now I had a biopsy on my womb came back normal cells, smear test normal and biopsy of polyp they didn't take away enough. Well here is the dilemma I am unable to get the polyp removed by local anaesthetic and they don't want to take it out under General anaesthetic because my b.m.I. is too high. I spoke to the lovely Kerry on here yesterday and she suggested spinal block I'm wondering if there are other alternatives.. Here I also have another problem since this afternoon I seem to be what I could only describe as a period with heavier bleeding and pain. When will this end !!!!!"

renee61138,2019-04-29T19:54+00:00,Hot Flashes???,Hello ladies. Ive been in peri for about 2 years now. I have many crazy symptoms. I'm 42 and my last period was March 6. For a bit I thought maybe i was pregnant but many test have said other wise. I have completly missed my Aprils period and from what Ive been told its common to miss a period. I should be due for a period in what i believe would be the first week in May. The last 2 days I've been hungrier than usual with some sweet and salty cravings which is my norm. I havent yest experienced hot flashes and i believe I had one today. Felt like a wave that came over me i felt dizzy and a little nauseated extremly hot and my heart rate sky rocketed. Thank god my husband was home. I splashed my face with cold water and put a cold rag on my neck. It lasted a few min. I also felt very shakey . Does this sound like a typical hot flash? Ive never had it so im unsure. And if so what do you ladies do to help it in the moment. Ughh so scary and has sent my anxiety into over drive.. Help...lol
staci88515,2019-04-30T18:08+00:00,Why am I different?,"Today, I was having a fine day, when I started to notice some anxiety creep in. I tried to ignore it, but it started to build. Then, my eyes got a bit wonky. Next, my palms began to sweat. Soon, I felt warm in my chest, back, and upper arms. Suddenly, I felt faint. My heart was beating fast and pounding. My legs became heavy. Am I passing out? Having a heart attack? I began to panic, but was in a situation where I couldn't flee. It subsided in about 10 minutes, but I am still reeling with aftereffects. Was it a hot flash? I feel like I am losing my mind. I was getting better and felt good for a few months. Now, I feel like I am headed down the roller coaster. I am so tired of being anxious and scared. I just want to cry. Why do all the other middle-aged women around me seem fine?"
Serradipity,2019-04-30T19:44+00:00,"OMG, so happy that I found this community!","Hi I'm Serra, And for the past 2 1/2 months I've been so anxious about possible being pregnant, but unsure if it's actually perimenopause. I'm 47 years old so it's most likely perimenopause. Plus I was told things like frequent urination and constipation along with nausea and food sensitivity and increased sex drive only happened in pregnancy. But after reading a lot of posts, I see that those things happen too. Also, I have an IUD, so pregnancy is really low to begin with. However, the reason I've been so worried about it; my 5yr Minerva was supposed to come out in Dec 20018, but I was traveling and got a nasty flu-bug passed around the family for 3 weeks. Then in Jan our oldest crashed the family car (everyone was okay-but I got really stressed out and started having breathing problems.) I had to go to the ER and was told I was having a panic attack, but the ER Doc said, ""...you know, your IUD doesn't work after it's expired..."" I replied, ""...my appointment is at the end of May."" Now, since I've had the IUD, I haven't had a ""bloody period"" and on the very rare occasion (especially fun sex with the hubby) some spotting. But everything else: Moodiness, crampy for the week, and overall PMSy. Normal. Then February came and I wasn't feeling so well; headaches, sensitive boobies, and a weird tummy feelings. Thought about what the ER doc said and took a test, came out negative. Started getting tired and grumpy as well as annoyed with certain foods. Then March came and things got interesting, talked to my mom and she told me how it was for her (Menopause) and thought, I must be going through it, I'm about the same age she started. The weight gain and the sudden freezing one moment, the being so freakin hot! Got a nice little belly going with my muffin top, still tired and moody and feeling sick all the time. But what got me was the sudden bizarre dreams, and waking in the middle of the night and not being able to go back to sleep. And what really started to get me worried was the increase of ""having to go to the bathroom"" and then for an entire week of Belly pain. My uterus felt like it was I don't know, cramping inward in different directions, while it was being pushed up into my abdomen, causing my abdomen to feel like it had a rubber band around it. Which comes and goes or I just got used to it. Besides the Belly pain felt very similar to the one time I've had an UTI...so again I thought that was the culprit. However, no pain when I urinated. But still a little worried (my first pregnancy never registered on the HPT, until an ultrasound was done at 4 months.) Took another HPT and it came out Negative. During that time I would say I'm between 6-9 weeks when I took the test. And now I have light headiness and everything else mentioned. I've been a mix of emotions; I've tried getting an earlier appointment, but no go. Now I don't know what I feel, my body is a kaleidoscope of symptoms. One day I see Menopause, the other I see Pregnancy. Am I reading too much into this, is this just the mind trying to tell me I'm pregnant but in reality I'm just starting the stages of Menopause? Counting down the days until I see the OB-GYN is driving me bonkers! Have any of you felt like this? Thank you in advance for your voice and thoughts, Serra"
pamela2016,2019-04-29T23:36+00:00,Is there anything that it doesn't mess with,ive never in all my 42 years have had acne now i look like a junkie wtf and not only that its aging me so bad dark circles under my eyes wrinkles i cant take no more and all these symptoms its horrible. any suggestions on dark circles and hormonal acne?
hopeforever,2019-04-03T20:40+00:00,My hormonal test came back OK. So how can that be if i am showing signs of perimenopause,"I just received a call from my doctor informing me that my hormonal blood work came back ok. But how can that be if i am showing signs that i am in preimenopause. My symptoms are anxiety, panic attacks, internal shaking, head pressure, ringing in the ears, weak legs and arms, heart palps, heart racing, back pain lower and upper, dizziness, rib pain, breathing, throat problems which feels like something in throat, a few hot flashes, sound sensitivity and light. sweaty feet,brain fog etc. I do not feel like my old self, she is gone. I am crying right now because i just want answers. I have been confined to my bed for the past 2 days with such fatigue and crazy symptoms. I saw a elderly couple walking past my home looking happy and i started crying. I am 44 and feel worst than a 80 year old. I am afraid to go out alone, afraid to get an attack . My life feels robbed and i do not know what to do. Dr's look at me crazy. I am so tired of running to the ER only for them to take blood work, ekg and results showing nothing. Thank God. Why don't they have answers? why are us women suffering ? This is a time in my life when i thought i would be the most happiest. My children are all grown. I had so much planned. And now this. I just cry because that is all i can do. Have any of you got back hormone test that came back ok ?"
