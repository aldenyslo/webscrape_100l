I'm so discourage but at the same time hopeful because I know God will give me the strength.

Merelym,2017-10-05T21:37+00:00,Abdominal discomfort for 2 months,"I posted a while ago about my mild cramp feeling in my right mid abdomen.  I decided after about 6 weeks of it maybe I should have it checked out.  Couldn't see my family dr so made an appt with another in a different clinic  She figured it could be gall bladder stones so did blood work and ordered an ultrasound.  I had the ultrasound a week ago and no word back from her so I called today and the clinic said ""oh she away till the 18th""  Oh GREAT.  Knowing my test results were also to be sent to  my family dr, I made an appt to see her next week.  I'm hoping its nothing serious and also hoping if it was maybe someone would have contacted ME for follow up.  Menopause has really sent my digestive system into a tail spin...always something.  To add to my symptoms, I had a stiff neck for about 2 weeks.  It very gradually worked its way out but now I read its one of the 66 symptoms of menopause! who knew?"

I went to the cardiologist a few days ago now Im being sent to pulmunarist, on top of that my sister's passing has been hard. I went to dr yesterday bloodwork say thyroid is overactive. She gave me biodentical progesterone to take at night and a new anxiety med. I had NO palpitations or anxiety yesterday at all. I took the progesterone pill last night and the anxiety this morning I cant stop shaking and body trembling all over with the heart palpitations. i think the progesterone and the prescription for anxiety brought it on really bad. I told her that tbe natural progesterone tends to make my palpitations and anxiety worse. I am freaking out about the fluid they found on lining of lungs. I was fine until i took the beta blocker last week. My chest is hurting it feels like something in my chest and throat. I really believe the beta blocker somehow caused fluid on my lungs. My body feels so weak, especially the legs. I cant sleep at night because of the discomfort and breathing. I won't be attending the funeral because i feel its too much for me. Oh God help me...!"
Wildfire123,2017-10-12T15:54+00:00,Normal Labs?,So my gyno says my labs are normal but my testosterone is almost nonexistent. But I'm having every single sign of perimenopause. Is this normal to have normal labs and still be going through perimenopause? The anxiety and depression and panic attacks are unbearable. I've developed agoraphobia because of them.
izzy70,2017-10-12T10:10+00:00,Change of HRT,"I had not long turned 46 - May last year. When I was 'diagnosed' as going through the menopause. I had went to the Doc as I was going to bed at night and suddenly going  freezing cold (down to my bones!) to boiling hot. It was affecting my sleep as it was waking me up at night. I though maybe I had an infection. I had been missing the odd period but was still getting them most of the time. I was also feeling depressed and confused and just generally in some kind of fog. Bloods were taken and it came back that my FSH levels were very high. I had hit perimenopause big time. I was given Evorel Sequi patches as my GP said that due to my age and it's relatively early onset, I had best protect myself from osteoporosis and heart disease etc. The patches calmed the temperature extremes down so that was good. Nearly 18 months down the line and I found myself back at my GP this week. The same female GP I had seen the year earlier. Only I found her noticeably less sympathetic. The heat extremes had started again and I felt depressed and anxious. I have suffered bouts of depression for years though and explained to the Doc that I didn't know if it was my usual common or garden depression or because of the Menopause. I told her I had no confidence, felt terribly depressed, was on the brink of packing my job in the day before as I felt I couldn't cope. Also that I felt really ugly, old and washed up as a woman. She just wasn't as understanding and supportive. It was as if she doubted me. ""What was your intention in coming along...what were you expecting""? she asked me. I told her I just wanted advice. If it was my clinical depression taking a turn for the worse or was it because the patches weren't doing it for me anymore. If it was the former I told her I'd just try and live with it. But if it were the latter then couldn't we try another HRT. Surely I didn't have to suffer this? She eventually gave me Elleste Duet 2mg tablets to try for 3 months. I said that at least we would know if they made me feel better then it was the Menopause. I understand that it's best for us to stay on a low dose and that there are dangers of being on a higher dose - but surely she could have afforded me a bit more sympathy? I felt she just couldn't be bothered! I needed a bit more support! This is not something we can discuss with anyone. We need a professionals advice and guidance surely? I just felt let down and and as if she didn't believe me. Unless of course, this is the Menopause talking and yet another symptom of how I'm feeling?  Has anyone had a similar experience? I wonder if the new increased dose really will make a difference and how long it'll take to work given that I had already been on patches of 1mg? Totally fed up and feel as if nobody understands this. From an ugly washed up old single woman of 47 :-( Cause that's how I feel x"

Horrible symptoms, really hard time.  I have been having heart fluttering, and an awareness of my heart beating.  I keep taking my blood pressure and taking my pulse frantically .  My friend who is younger then me was just hospitalized with congestive heart failure.  She was short of breath, swollen, couldn't walk and collapsed on the train going to work.  She was told she had a mild heart attack and needs a stent put in.  She was so hysterical she had to be sedated.   Since this happened I don't know if it's my anxiety and stress over it, or something is wrong.  I have had blood tests and heart tests done, always normal.

radhandrea,2017-10-09T18:38+00:00,Panic Attack,"Hi ladies, Need some help! Not sure what's happening to me recently, but I'm experiencing numerous issues which have all arisen in the last couple of months. These include sweating, succession of hot flashes, hyperventilation, compulsive obsessive disorder , anxiety, bouts of sudden anger , deep seated fear, extreme tiredness, the list goes on... I was told earlier this year before such symptoms emerged by a medical professional that I was peri-menopausal, and was sent on my way.  I had just turned 45 years then and it was a real slap in the face, I know that my periods had ceased a year before but still I didn't want to believe it! Anyway this Saturday just gone I was traveling by overground train to visit my family on the other side of London. I hate this journey always, it freaks me out at the best of times. It takes a few hrs and I'm with 7 year old son. On the second train I began feeling nauseous and struggled to get up a leave. On the platform walking towards the exit I felt even more light headed, but felt comfort ed in the fact that my family would be collecting me from outside. I managed to exit with my son beside me , I suddenly begun to panic when I didn't see my uncle. All of a sudden whilst in the midst of a phone conversation I felt constricted in the back of my throat as though I was choking and I fell to the ground, I couldn't talk and was struggling to breathe, right then and there I thought my time had come and that I would die.  The general public were phenomenal, people raced around us helping my son and I . An ambulance was called, I was totally unresponsive at first like I was in a different timeline to those bodies hovering over and around us. I was petrified! Has anyone experienced  anything similar and is there any natural remedy out there that will help me and calm my anxiety. Thanks 🙏🏻"

I started off with my first anxiety attack 12 years ago, but things got worse with menopause setting in.  Palpitations, sleepless nights, fatigue, foggy head, dizzy spells, frequent urination, joint pain, head-neck-back pain, feeling like I have the flu. Both my primary care and OBGYN told me there was no point in having blood work done because there is little that can be done.  How can this be true?  Please share any suggestions.  I will pray for all of us."

Some of you know that i have posted a lot on this forum, anxiety being the most terrible symptom that i have been struggling with. This is my current problem. About 4 years ago I was diagnosed with peri-menopause. This was according to blood work done. I visited my gyne whom said that i am to young for HRT and also due to the fact that I have breast cancer in both side of the family. He said that we can consider this, but only if I cannot continue feeling like i do. So 2 years ago I went for blood work again. My testosterone count was like non existing. He injected me with testosterone and all was well for a time. Last year January I was again having a lot of nasty symptoms and again the blood work confirmed that i was in peri. So I went on HRT for 3 months and meds was given for the hot flashes. Again at the beginning of the year I was having nasty symptoms again. Although this time my blood work came back normal but my progesterone was a bit low. My gp said it was nothing as this was due to the follicar stage that I was in. Since May of this year I started with anxiety and about 44 of the 66 symptoms of peri. So again I order blood work. This came back normal again. So what now, now that i am having the most worst symptoms I am not in peri although on 3 previous occasions i was diagnosed as peri? I am so terribly confused. Am I missing something here? Please help me?"

My anxiety is greatly improved with both these meds, feel relaxed & able to cope. It's the hot flushes & sweating that is stopping me from doing most things. Any change of atmosphere at any temperature, so walking from one room to another, even walking down the Tesco fridge isle will cause me to sweat, so it can be seen running down my face, neck & chest. A 5 min walk, even a swim. My doors & windows are open while the rest of the family freezes! The only way to avoid triggers is to do nothing, which is impossible. I'm only in my 2nd month of HRT. The doc says it can take months to get under control & its too early to increase dosage. This has been for 2 years now & although have seen some improvement with HRT my friends say they've never seen anyone suffer the flushes & sweats as much but I bet there's some of you out there that can relate.

Klp77,2017-10-06T16:22+00:00,Elleste Solo 1mg - should I or shouldn't I,"Been peri-menopausal for a few years but didn't really start having serious effects until last year when the hot flashes kicked in big style. Managed to get them under control with sage supplements, but about 8 weeks ago these just seemed to stop working and the hot flashes returned, along with mood swings, etc (and my weight has been steadily creeping up). Been to see the Dr today and she has given me Elleste Solo 1mg tablets as I already have the Mirena coil. I then made the mistake of coming home and reading up on the side effects online ... and have now basically scared myself stupid, to the point I'm thinking the mood swings and flashes might be easier to deal with. Does anyone have any positive experience of these (or HRT in general) or will I doomed to massive weight gain / stomach problems / etc if I do take them?"
annie-mae,2017-10-06T09:50+00:00,ALL the symptoms - and more. Help!,"Hi Everyone, I've been lurking here for a few weeks and whilst sorry so many of you feel as bad as I do, I'm getting such encouragement that I'm not alone. I started with dizziness/vertigo 18 months ago and since then have had every symptom of peri  and extreme anxiety/panic (it's hard to tell the difference), often several in the same day. Oh, except hot flashes (yet)!! I'm shaky, off-balance, nauseous, certain I've got a brain tumour/cancer/MS etc but logically I know it's none of those... doesn't help though. Anyway, in the last couple of days, my hands and feet have got so cold and some of my fingers and toes feel 'odd' and crampy and as if they won't work. The muscles in my upper arms too feel stiff (and as if I'm cold inside?) and weak. Does anyone else recognise this? I know I'm hyper-sensitive to all pain/ache now but Iike so many of us, I feel I'm going mad. Suppose I just want some company and a big old virtual hug. THank you, all."

I practice deep breathing and mindfulness exercises, I've been getting out and going for long walks every day (even when I feel lousy), I listen to Dr Claire Weekes on audiobook, I see a therapist, I take supplements....all good, right? But I still wake up every morning terrified that I've got MS or ALS or a brain tumour or I'm having a stroke or I have some other horrific disease.....and then I start getting (more) anxious which makes the symptoms worse....I dread getting into the shower because I almost always feel dizzy and shaky when I'm showering, and I no longer look forward to going to work (but I'm terrified to stay home alone). I feel as though I'm having a nervous breakdown....it's just so frustrating and exhausting to feel this way every day.  I'm not the only one feeling this way...am I? How do the rest of you manage?"

Guest,2017-09-25T13:30+00:00,Will meno finally bring relief?,"Hi All, haven't posted in a while, been busy with post hurricane Irma stuff, so much fun, and getting settled back home after being away for the summer. For you newbies, I've had an extremely bad year starting last August. I'll be 53 in January. Any and every symptom on that 66 symptoms of perimenopause list and about 10 more on top of that. It's been hellacious. For the past couple of weeks my symptoms are getting lesser. Now not sure if they will cycle around again, but here is what I'm doing differently. I started taking Vitamin B12 and Vitamin B6. The specialist in NYC said that I have a genetic factor with MTHFR where I can't absorb Vitamin B. But also, my period was due last Tuesday. And it's now Monday, almost a week later, and it's still not here???? When I was due I got bloated for a few days, but then nothing. Had a headache yesterday, but still nothing. Every now and then I get the burning legs and achy body and sick feelings, but much lesser degree. This will be the first period I've ever missed in my life (except in pregnancy of course). So am I finally entering meno realm and leaving awful perimeno behind me? I've even had three almost completely normal days this month!!! This hasn't happened in a whole year! Any of you on this forum gotten better after meno finally sets in?????"

I stated when I was 43 and haven't had a period in 5 years, but all of the sudden the last few months I feel like crying, fighting with my body gaining weight in places that I have never had a problem with, just out of control with life in general.  Is this normal?  When I first started going through menopause I was married and had a few mood swings, but not like this. Just want to be left alone and by myself.  Not married now, but I have children and grandchildren, but I just feel like I want to escape life for a while before I have a major melt down. What is wrong with me?????"

I have severe pain in my thighs from the groin area to the knee level, especially the inner thigh. It has been around for a few days, today I can barely walk as if I ran a marathon yesterday. I did climb up and down my staircase yesterday a good couple of times but I do it every day, but the pain was never there before. It seems to be a deep musce-tendon pain. I also started takig Promensil-red clover extract a few days ago, I reduced the dose to 1/3 because of severe breast tenderness and I wonder if this might be a culprit? Any suggestions?"

I also feel pressure in my front lower pelvic area. It’s not cramps though. Does this happen to anyone else??"
Suki_girl,2017-10-04T06:44+00:00,Reposting this list of peri symptoms because it answers many of your questions.,"SIXTY-SIX PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS of perimenopause:- These are very real physical changes and conditions. Some symptoms alarm a woman that she may be suffering from a serious disease. Perhaps you know the more common ones related to menopausal symptoms in this list. But many of these may surprise you, as they have not been typically associated with this normal physiological transformation.  1. Change in Menstrual Cycle, Cycles may get closer together or farther apart, lighter and shorter in duration or much heavier, lasting longer than one has been accustomed to. Menses may seem to take forever to begin with dark spotting for days until you actually flow, or you might feel like you have your menses every two weeks. 2. Menstrual Flooding can come on with sudden onset and feel like you may hemorrhage to death. Or it can be a gradual build up just when you think your menses will end and you start gushing for days. Flooding commonly accompanies the woman with uterine fibroids as she transits into menopause. 3. Headaches, Migraines, especially before, during or at the end of your menses debilitate and radically interferes with normal functioning. 4. Decreased Motor Coordination, Clumsiness, almost begins to make the woman who experiences this feel like she is a bit spastic, certainly less than graceful during perhaps an already awkward period in her life.  5. Lethargy, a persistent feeling sluggishness physically and mentally, that seems to negate ones ability to do much.  6. Physical Exhaustion , and Crushing Crashing Fatigue that can come on so suddenly and grip you into feeling like you will collapse unless you stop this instant. 7. Exacerbation of any Chronic Illness or Existing Condition transpires as hormones decline or deviate from their normal balance. 8. Insomnia, this includes a new or unusual pattern of either difficulty falling asleep, or dropping off to sleep for a few hours and then awakening with the inability to return to sleep. 9. Sleep Disturbances sometimes are from nightmares, night sweats, or just a vague sense of restlessness keeping you up or disrupting your precious revitalizing retreat from this realm of responsibilities. 10. Night Sweats often begin between a woman?s breasts, initially a night or two before her menses, waking her from sleep, later more profoundly disturbing with up to total body saturation, followed by damp or sweat drenched chills. 11. Interference With Dream Recall interrupts the sense of normal sleep, if you are someone accustomed to vivid or at least some detailed memory of your dreamtime.  12. Muscle Cramps can occur anywhere in the body from legs to back to neck, and sometimes reflects the need for more calcium, or simply that your progesterone levels are too low.  13. Low Backache often worsens before or during menses, but if your hormones remain at low levels, you can experience it on a regular basis. 14. Gall Bladder Symptoms of pain, spasms and discomfort felt in the right upper abdominal quadrant under the ribs, which may be accompanied by belching, bloating, and intolerance to certain foods reflect the increased liver load with declining hormones.  15. Frequent Urination, or sensations that mimic urinary infections is a disturbing symptom often unrelieved by actual urination. It is often experienced as the sensation of needing to urinate all the time, even immediately afterwards. 16. Urinary Incontinence, the uncontrollable and spontaneous loss of urine, or the Urge for Incontinence, can occur suddenly or feel continuous, and not only in response to coughing, sneezing, jumping or running.  17. Hypoglycemic Reactions happen when suddenly your blood sugar crashes and you must have food now. 18. Food Cravings, often for sweets or salty foods, but can include sour or pungent foods.  19. Increased Appetite, especially at night and after dinner contributes to that unusual and unwanted weight gain. 20. Dark Circles Under Eyes can also be caused by adrenal exhaustion and thyroid dysfunctions, but no amount of sleep seems to eliminate it.  21. Joint and Muscle Pain, Achy, Sore Joints, Muscles and Tendons, which sometimes develop into actual carpal tunnel syndrome, or give rise to the questioning of other disease possibilities. 22. Increased Tension in Muscles demonstrates itself in those hunched up shoulders as you work or talk about anything uncomfortable, along with promoting lower back pain and a stiff neck. 23. Increased Hair Loss or Thinning anywhere on body, including your head, armpits, pubic area. 24. Increase in Facial Hair especially under your chin, or along your jaw line. It may be defined by generalized hair growth, or a specific and coarse single strand of hair that pokes out, even curls.  25. Unusually Hair Growth, around Nipples, between Breasts, down your back, places where your hair was finer, less coarse. 26. Acne, quite disturbing to any woman who dealt with this in adolescence and never thought it would recur.  27. Infertility causes grief in the woman who postponed pregnancy in her earlier years and now wishes to conceive, carry to term a healthy baby, and discovers she is unable to do so.  28. Loss of Breast Tissue begins with the decrease of progesterone production. Women often feel as though their breast have become empty sacs devoid of their normal fullness, with or without sagging. 29. Breast Soreness/Tenderness/Pain/ Engorgement and swelling, occurs particularly a few days to one week before bleeding actually begins, which usually potentiates complete relief of any pain or swelling. 30. Painful, or tender nipples have been described as this exquisite localized pain only in the nipples and suggests estrogen excess.  31. Cold Extremities feels quite strange especially in the presence of a hot flash, the combination of which is not impossible. 32. Being Accident Prone, bumping into things, not even realizing it until the bruise reveals itself later and then lacking the ability to recall the causative incident feels perplexing and a little scary at the prospect of something more damaging.  33. Hot flashes initially may be described as mild to severe flushes of heat waves, and for some women these evolve into intense outbreaks of sudden heat with sweating and turning bright red all over.  34. Loss of Sexual Energy, our Libido, can be marked by a gradual or sudden disinterest in sex, to the development of an actual aversion.  35. Painful Sex often described as if one?s vagina would tear open at the point of penetration along with feelings of abrasion during intercourse. 36. Vaginal Dryness, Irritation, sometimes accompanied by a consistent unusual discharge - typically odor free, negates a woman?s ability to be sexually active, or able to enjoy or be comfortable in her body. 37. Dizziness, feeling lightheaded and the loss of physical balance, and even a bit wobbling at times, requires pause in movement to prevent falling over or deepening into vertigo or feeling faint. 38. Ringing in the Ears, Tinnitus, can be experienced as a pulsing sensation, a whooshing sound, an almost musical or buzzing sound with a fuzzy sensation. 39. Abdominal Bloating comes on suddenly often after eating, or seems to be all the time, and can be visibly evident making you feel that you look like you are pregnant.  40. Weight Gain disturbs most women, particularly when it seems to happen over a couple of days, settles in the waist, buttocks and thighs, promoting a visceral thickening from the waist down, the classic middle-aged figure. 41. Fluid Retention, Edema, commonly with swelling in the legs and ankles, though not limited to this area and it is unrelieved by urination. 42. Palpitations or Heart Racing usually comes on suddenly, without warning or provocation, and dissipates spontaneously. The experience can be so wild and intense that a woman may become alarmed and wonder if she is having a heart attack.  43. Irregularities in your Heart Rate may feel more like your heart has just done a flip-flop or skipped a beat. 44. Constipation/Diarrhea, intermittent or alternating, results from declining hormone levels, which increase the demands on liver function and alters intestinal motility. 45. Tendency towards Candidiasis can increase, even if you have no prior known history ? and if you do, it may worsen. 46. Gastrointestinal Distress, Increased Flatulence, Unrelieved Gas pains, Indigestion, Nausea all can reflect intestinal changes due to hormonal imbalances. 47. Slow Digestion often goes along with the bloat ? what previously took four to five hours to digest, now seems to take all night. It seems worse in the evenings. 48. Lack of Appetite may be experienced as more of a lack of interest in food, going to the frig and standing there with the door open and staring blankly. Feeling completely uninspired, you busy yourself with something else and forget that you need to eat. 49. Changes in Body Odor especially disturbing when it seems to focus in the groin area, but can be anywhere on the body. 50. Puffy Eyes, not only from sleep disturbances, but also can accompany low progesterone. 51. Facial Pallor alternating with Facial Flushes is often intermittent with hot flashes. 52. Flare up of Arthritis worsens with low progesterone levels and increase sugar intake. 53. Loss of Bone Density, Osteoporosis, is not only an elderly woman?s disease, though it seems to develop over an extended period and is triggered by the decline of hormone production. 54. Dry Hair, Change in Skin Tone, Integrity, and Texture, becomes more wrinkled, and may begin the thinning process. 55. Changes in your Fingernails characterized by easy breakage, bending, cracking and getting softer. 56. Itchy, Crawly Skin with a strange sensation like insects crawling around under the skin ? quite different than the dry skin feeling. 57. Muscle tone seems to slack and sag, and loose its previous response to normal exercise. 58. Pelvic Pain can be random and independent of cycles and may feel continuous for some women. 59. Dry, Itchy Eyes felt in the deep posterior aspect of the eye socket, as well as superficially. 60. Teeth Aching or the experience of a strange sensation in one?s teeth or gums, often accompanied by an increase in bleeding gums. 61. Change in the normal Tongue sensation, which can be accompanied by a feeling of burning in your tongue and roof of mouth, malodorous breath or change in breath odor, and/or a bad taste in your mouth. 62. Memory Loss or Lapses in time, makes one feel disoriented and less focused, especially when you go into another room to get something specific and seconds later cannot remember what you went to retrieve. 63. Feeling Faint for no known reason (this does not include standing up too quickly) 64. Tingling in Extremities not only feels weird and like your hands or feet are falling asleep, but if persistent can be a symptom of diabetes, B12, potassium or calcium deficiency, or a compromise in blood vessel flexibility. 65. Sensation of Electrical Stimulation,or Shock occurring in the tissue under the skin, and may signal you that a hot flash will begin. 66. Increase and worsening of Allergies occurs as hormones become imbalanced, so can our immune system."

Funny thing though, they started off as what felt like hormonal surges in my body. Which lead me to anxious thinking, which brings me to today.  I will apologize if this is scattered. I’m feeling pretty scattered right now. I went I’d AD when I was 28. It provided great relief for 10 years. With some breakthrough hormonal surges that left me in bed. What I mean by hormonal surges is this: anxiety, shaking uncontrollably, muscle tension, feelings on doom, a warm flush from my chest/back down to my stomach and uncontrollable thoughts. Oh yeah, and racing heart and tightness in my chest.  These surges normally happened a few days into my period. Now, flash forward to today. I was getting these surges periodically, now they are coming on regularly. I’m freaking out. I have three kids at home (12,10 & 10). The thoughts of not being able to function are driving me crazy. I have muscle tension, abdominal pain, lightheadedness, anxiety, racing thoughts, warm flushes and tingling.  What can I do to help. I have to be strong for my kids. I have to be kind to myself.

My periods are really irregular at the moment - anything from 18 days to 42. In July I had a really long period of 10 days plus 2 days of very light/spotting both before and after.Then I had 31 days before a 3 day period, then 18 days before a 5 day period and then 30 days to 10 days of spotting/streaks with 2 days of what seemed like a light period in the middle.

I was referred to a neurologist who confirmed I have neither of these, thank God, and spoke very sensibly about hormones and anxiety!  It was such a relief not only to have this confirmation about my fear, which I had worried about for months, but also to have a great doctor listent to me and not just think I was ""another crazy woman in midlife.""  Is anyone else having these quite scary symptoms??? Much love to you all. x"

I am glad I am not the only one who thinks they are dying from some terminal disease. Turning 50 in a few weeks and I was expecting ""the change"" but  NO ONE PREPARED ME FOR THIS.  I have always been extremely active, I am a fitness instructor and I run, now I feel that I could not even be bothered getting out of bed most days. I NEVER take medication and now I am on anti-despressants, tranquilizers and sleeping tablets. It's like I woke up one day and I had been body snatched!

If so , 1)What symptons did it help?2) How long before results? 3) Did they prescribe herbs along with it? 4) Did you have an side effect on first treatment? I did my first acupuncture treatment on yesterday and she said she was concentrating on treating my stomach because of bloating and acid reflux really bad. Well i felt really good afterward , so calm and peaceful. Later I noticed my stomach was very tender from the needles and seem to bloat more. She gave me herbs to take for the stomach and some to take for for the perimenopause symptons. I was very skeptical about taking them but also desperate to find something that may help. I only tried the stomach , 2 capsules with meals. OMG! It bloated the stomach more , whereas my back was extremely aching and burning from the bloating. Thank God i didnt try the other one , (black round balls take 5 of them 2 times a day scares me) . I had a miserable night last night. Peri has never affected my sleep but last i was so uncomfortable for the bloating and aching back, very agitated. I want to hear from others of their experience with acupuncture, because im thinking of not proceeding with it. I would like to add that around ovulation time i get the bloating and acid reflux really bad. Im approaching that time so it could be both ovulation and acupunture effect?"

I'm soon to be 49. I thought my symptoms were getting better. Then on March 8th started having bad stomach cramps and low back pain which lasted 2 1/2 weeks. Then the terrible indigestion started with heart palpitations and then of course major anxiety. My period which has been about every 18 days since December is now late. I live each day in fear and terror of heart palpitations and anxiety. I seriously feel like I might die everyday. This is absolutely no way to live. I feel bad for my poor husband and daughter.

I have been suffering with night sweats, mood swings, tearfulness and aching hip bone for a while now and saw my doc last Monday.  I asked if she would do a hormone blood test which is due next Tuesday.   After talking to her for 40 mins and her doing some background digging she told me that when I had an ectopic pregnancy 12 years ago and lost my right tube and ovary that my estrogen levels would have diminished greatly and that with all the symptoms I'm having now she would highly recommend that I start HRT!   At first I was shocked as I considered myself too young but after listening to everything she said I now feel that this could be a fantastic option for me.  In the last few months I have flown into constant rages with my hubby and kids and just cant seem to control them when I get into that state then out of knowhere I can just start sobbing uncontrollably. I've done a little bit of research on internet about pros and cons but I would really like to hear from women who have actually gone down this route of HRT before the menopause.  I would like to know the ""real"" pros and cons and whether (as stated on some sites) it does actually increase your mood, energy, sleeping patterns, flushes and libido.   I appreciate anyone taking the time to reply as I just need to hear personal experiences. Thanks so much Bairb xx"

laura370,2017-09-25T04:21+00:00,I feel like I'm driving my family away!!,"These last few months I feel like I'm a monster. Today my husband even spoke of divorce if I can't stop this obsessive behavior of thinking he's doing things he swears he's not. He is a truck driver and is gone for weeks and all I think about is that he's doing things out there that he shouldn't. He's been a truck driver for over 20 years and I never had this feeling before until I turned 50. I know he's spoken to his ex-wife of 30+ years just recently. He says he told me she contacted him via text and he says that when he told me about it that I said I didn't care if he spoke to her. Now, I don't remember saying this to him, but he swears I did. Later, I found her name on his phone and went ballistic!!! He didn't act guilty and was even surprised when I lost it. He said all they do is text once in awhile and it's all innocent. I told him to stop and he said, ""No problem"" and gave me his phone to let me block her. He even let me send her a text to tell her to stop texting him. He was perfectly fine with this and said if he'd known he would never had done it to begin with. Now all I do is doubt everything he tells me and want to check everything he has to make sure other things aren't going on. He's apologized profusely and even told me to go through his stuff any time I feel like it if it makes me feel better. Now we've been going around and around this for about 3 months now and he's totally done with all this. I will be fine one day and then the next I'm doubting everything he says and accusing him of all kinds of things. I'm not sure if this is peri-menopause or the fact that I found his ex's name on his phone that has started this craziness. I feel bad because just as he thinks we've gotten everything hashed out and we start acting normal again, I will hit him again with accusations. WHAT DO I DO??? We have an autistic daughter and another daughter that still lives with us and we both worry about them. But I know he's at the end of his rope and frankly I really don't blame him. I just don't know what to do since we have no health insurance and I can't see a doctor."

So trying to put things into perspective. I'm 48 and for a few months have been having sweating episodes. Anxiety and panic attacks for a few months longer than that.  The sweating is random, but does occur more when it's warm outside and when I'm eating or drinking. I have the odd night sweat, but not horrendously.  I'm terrified it's some rare cancer and not peri as my periods still come. Though they are more frequent and shorter. I've even paid for a private urine test to check for the thing I fear, though now the thought of handing that over for testing has me sick with worry. It's so hard to deduce what's a peri symptom and what's not. My gp has ordered bloods to check hormone levels but I've heard they are unreliable at this point. I wish I'd skipped a period, then at least I'd have a clue. Anyone out there with similar experiences before I completely lose the plot? Xxx"

I am always on time with my period. 3.  This month, I am late.  As when I missed my period for 2 months, I experienced extreme cramping (starting last Wednesday), extreme fatigue, and moodiness which has always been common for me.  No bleeding yet and according to my typical schedule, I should be.  The cramping, fatigue, and moodiness has stopped .. all PMS symptoms for me and always have been. 4.  I am 49 years old. 5.

stella19032,2014-08-11T17:37+00:00,Am I mad or on the brink of death?,"Hi there. I apologise in advance if this is rambling and senseless. I used to be a happy and rational person. This started a good while ago but crystallised around November last year.  I started getting terrified about my health, in a way I have never done before. Jiggly things were happening and my doctors didn't understand why I was terrified I had some horrendous cancer every time I went back with a new symptom. Eventually I was diagnosed with reflux and given medication but it's all been down hill from there. I have had so many tests it's untrue.i get terrified every time I feel I'll ( which I do all the time) and jump to the worst possible conclusion. At the moment I'm terrified I have a particular cancer syndrome as I keep sweating when I eat, or if I'm in a warm room or if I'm stressed. I also go a bit red but not beetroot. I feel queasy all the time, I also have the sensation of butterflies in my stomach a majority of the time. My periods aren't erratic but are 24/25 days apart and lighter flow with darker blood. Is this a peri symptom?  I'm so confused. Scared and alone - don't really have any peers to compare notes with. I do have a 2 year old son and the fear of my dying and leaving him has made my terror worse. If these are symptoms is there anything I can do to make them go away? I have a docs appointment tomorrow and any tips as to how not to come across as crazy lady would be really helpful x ps I'm 48, 49 in November x"

The reason I didn't suspect is that my periods have been more regular in the last few years than in my life - though short cycled - 3 weeks, though have become about 3.5. Two periods ago though I got a yeast infection in the middle of it (haven't had one in 20 years). By the time I got rid of it I only had about  a week until my next period. I had extra sore breasts for the week before and felt really bloated. Then the night before I started itching and sex hurt. All through this period I've had headaches, been really fatigued (much more than normal) and weirdest of all for me was I couldn't use tampons - they hurt. I've used them for decades. I'm on day 4 of my period - it's very light but I still have vaginal discomfort.  All of this seems to be around my period so I'm wondering if either I got another yeast infection somehow or if I have lower than normal estrogen....Perimenopause? Can it come on like that? I have had  migraines for the past few years and some other on and off things, but no cessation of my period or real hot flashes. I am the right age though. So...confused. Ideas?"

I also have excessive saliva and I keep catching my lip or cheek because of the swelling.

I thought I was literally going out of my mind!  In addition feelings of doom and gloom hopelessness anxiety heart palpitations waking me up every morning like clockwork and then awful overwhelming feeling of fear doom and gloom which lasted all day everyday.    All this is due to peri menopause I believe.  I still have periods but very irregular and sometimes missed just to start the next month and only spotting but can last all month!  This is all too real and awful, it has almost been a year for me since all these symptoms started but I can honestly say I am much better than when it all started I take no hrt as they really are not good for our bodies.  I just started praying harder to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and started focusing on me and my needs for once in my life and exercising. But one thing I want to tell you please also have your thyroid checked out because with me I believe all these changes with the peri menopause affected my thyroid and I am now taking MEDS for my hypothyroid.  And hypothyroid mimics peri menopause in many symptoms.  I know I am dealing with both and imagine that and what I'm going through.

flavia76824,2017-09-15T21:18+00:00,Think I've finally hit the menopause,I'm coming up to 48yrs and I think I've hit the menopause. My periods have always been regular and a standard 7days. In the past 6weeks I've been having little bursts of hotness - some days more than others and some days not at all and most significantly no period for 7 weeks . I've always been a bad sleeper so insomnia as one of the symptoms of the menopause means nothing to me. Weight gain also seems to be a symptom but as I have been following a strict diet since January I can't really on that either. Trying to get a doctors appointment at my surgery is ridiculous.  I've read up on the menopause on the internet the past couple of weeks but I was just wondering a couple of things.... 1. I'm childless (out of choice) and wondered if it could have an effect on my symptoms 2. My mum breezed through her menopause - a few sweats but not much more. Am I likely to be fortunate enough to follow in my mothers footsteps for the first time in my life

Guest,2017-08-20T21:17+00:00,Menopause Odor,"I'm 52, and last period was 1 1/2 yrs ago. I'm having classic symptoms of menopause, but not severely. In the last couple of months though, I've developed a sharp fishy odor in my genitals. I can smell it when I sit with my legs open in a chair, even after showering. I have zero discharge. Zero, ever. Dry as a bone, as evidenced after wearing undies for a day, and then I wear thin cotton. Usually, I wear cotton loose skirts and nothing else, no panties. No urinary leakage, either (hence no need for panties under skirts). No discharge to get on my skirts. I am not itchy, ever either.I shower every day, often twice, with a handheld shower nozzle, directly on area. As recommended by my Gyn., mostly just gentle fingers in all the crevices, labial folds, etc. and H20. In desperation, I've tried Cetaphil, unscented Dove, etc. Nothing harsh. I am clean when I get out and then I've looked in a hand mirror, no visible discharge anywhere after toweling. Even after just drying off, with inner labia skin dry, I can touch JUST the skin (not inside where the urinary opening is) and smell the finger. There is definitely the faint smell of fishiness. Just the skin, not a discharge, not a day's sweat (even after I've tried soap)! Right out of the shower. Within a couple of hours I can smell myself very strongly if I just bend over at the waist. This is not the disease known as ""trimethylaminuria (fish odour syndrome)"". I'm not on any new meds, no new diet or exercise regime. My vitals, cholesterol, appear those of a 25 yr. old, and I'm super healthy, exercise, etc. Please note the measures I've already taken:  It's NOT (BV) Bacterial vaginosis.  TESTED last week at the Gyn.      Negative. STDs? TESTED for EVERYTHING though I'm married 22 yrs.            Negative.  No discharge at ALL to even smell. ALWAYS DRY.                             None I eat yogurt daily, though I've stepped it up lately out of desperation. My husband is too kind to agree with me that anything has changed there odor-wise. But I can see his face during sex, and forget about letting him go down there. He and I used to  laugh that I (really do) smell like Scotch tape. Not bad, just fun and curious.  . I don't believe in all of the homeopathic remedies. I just don't. My doc doesn't seem keen on HRT, and this is killing my sexual mental health and harming my married life. I'm so disgusted and embarrassed about the smell, I can't even have orgasms because I'm too self-conscious.  Should I insist on HRT or ERT, or whatever? I'm not hight risk for breast cancer, nor stroke or heart disease."

danielle35642,2017-09-13T14:16+00:00,All doctors are required to observe for possible dv,"A poster wrote that ""domestic violence isn't something gp's deal with ""---- it's my understanding that a doctor in any area of medicine can and at some point likely will encounter patients who present with injuries due to dv--- any doctor is ethically responsible to be aware of this and to be observant of any symptoms or injuries, and certain behaviors or comments that could indicate dv. It is common for a victim of dv for example to see a doctor for another reason for example, anxiety. If the doctor has his eyes open and notices the patient has a couple bruises on her arms or seems guarded about sharing information, that's just an example of something that would tip off a doctor who has his eyes half open to the possibility of dv. At that point the doctor should raise in a sensitive manner if the patient is safe at home. Some doctors offices now ask as a matter of routine to all patients if they are safe at home. So I disagree that a gp doctor doesn't encounter dv or have a responsibility to address it."
danielle35642,2017-09-11T14:17+00:00,Should I get rid of this doctor?,"I've had this doctor for close to 3 years... he always seemed mild mannered, he seemed ok but during that time I only saw him for 'easy' routine things-- he was good about returning calls, however I did realize he spent minimal time and didn't really delve into asking questions that might help him form a bigger picture of my health- kind of a basic hmo doctor (I'm sure some are really good but overall they are owned by the insurance groups and really aren't the way doctors used to be) Now to my concern-- although in the past I saw him several times for minor issues the past months I went to him for more complex causes that would require more than just a quick 5 minute visit. First of all I went to see him recently for symptoms I've continued to have after (sad to say) I had a head injury from being assaulted (by my partner)--- during the visit I told him my symptoms which any conscientious doctor would automatically inquire what caused it, he was as usual trying to quickly get me in and out in a few minutes. He finally asked if I knew what might be causing my symptoms (headache, humming noise in head, some difficulty w memory etc) and I told him it was due to a head injury. He asked if I ""fell and hit my head"" and I told him actually I was assaulted. He appeared uncomfortable but asked if it was someone I knew, I said yes , it was my partner. He mumbled something about referring me to a neurologist. I told him it was more than one incident of being hit in head. All he did was said they would call me with referral. No questions asking if I'm safe, or taking time to talk to me about domestic violence or even asking if I'm still with him-- besides the obvious ethical concern raised by his total lack of assessing my situation / safety, offering referrals etc which should just be a given from any physician presented with a patient who has injuries from domestic violence-- there is the question of his duty legally to report injuries from domestic violence.  I was shocked by his complete indifference and absence of any type of concern or practical help or appropriate measures to determine if I am safe or is he just sending me back to where it happened etc The neurologist office called telling me they had appointment for me in TWO months. I asked if she was aware the visit was for head trauma and seemed like it would be scheduled asap due to the critical nature of head injuries. The girl said she was confused because the reason my doctor referred me to the neurologist was due to ""mild memory loss""!!! ? I was dumbfounded and extremely angry and frustrated to say the least that my doctor who has treated me for several years had, upon knowing I had head injury from an assault , omitted that and simply reported the reason as memory loss.  I explained to the girl at the neurologist office that the reason was for symptoms I was having DUE to head trauma. She said she would call my doctor office right away and suggested that I also call since I'm the patient and let them know about the ""mistake"".  I called my doctor office and the girl was very nice and concerned and looked at the notes- she said the doctor had referred me over for the reason of memory loss!-- no mention of the actual reason of head trauma. She said she would have the doctor call me. He called back a few hours later asking what I need. I said I was puzzled why he had failed to mention the head trauma- the critical and only thing I saw him for. He said he ""didn't remember me mentioning about that or being assaulted!???  Then he said ""well as long as your going to see the neurologist why is it important for you that I correct the office notes? At this point I'm honestly not sure if he just is clueless or if he has some personal reason he doesn't like addressing domestic violence?? As calmly and politely as possible I tell him that I have always understood it's important for people to make sure their medical records are accurate and that something as critical as a head trauma needs to be reflected in my records-- he said ""I feel like your arguing with me-- I told you I don't recall any mention of an assault or head trauma-- I remember we talked about headache and some memory loss... but I suppose ""if it's so important to you"" then I'll add something to the notes about the trauma.   ?? That was it-- no apology, no inquiry as to whether I am safe or ok or do I need referrals etc.  Before this there was one morning I had to go to the emergency dept after an assault- that doctor was very different- really on point- concerned and took time specifically addressing domestic violence with me, had a social worker come in to talk to me etc and said he had to make a report because it was clear to him the injury was a result of dv. This so called family doctor I can't tell honestly if he has just led a sheltered type of life and hasn't seen patients for dv injuries-- that would be a little hard to envision since he's been in practice for a good 25 years-- I suppose it's possible he's just sheltered and clueless about the real world issues like domestic violence and only sees patients for the flu, blood pressure, etc?    Or... for personal reasons he's uncomfortable with the issue of domestic violence and that would explain his quick brush off to refer me to a specialist with no inquiry like the other doctor did, and also would explain why he neglected to include the fact I have head trauma from a dv assault. It's very hard to find it credible his claim that he doesn't recall any mention by me of the assault- and that all he recalls is that I saw him for headache and memory loss. I appreciate any thoughts on this especially your thoughts on if it sounds like he purposely left out mention of the dv assault or if he is just clueless. His utter lack of concern or even bothering to inquire if I'm okay or safe is to be blunt seems like total neglect of his duties and incompetence ( plus just basic human decency and concern ) I don't know if it's worth it to try to have a discussion w him regarding my concern about his not recording the injury in his notes and total lack of concern or follow through - and point out that he never bothered to determine if I'm safe or report it. Or if I should consider filing a complaint with the board? And look for other doctor. I posted this in menopause because he is the same doctor who when I let him know I haven't had periods in over six months and requested bloodwork done to determine what would help my menopause symptoms, this doctor called back and left a message that simply said ""your blood test confirms your going through the change"" --- what a genius-- lol, I already knew that as I had told him I knew I was going through it because I haven't had any periods in over half a year. I called him back once again hello?? And politely informed him that yes I was aware I'm going through ""the change "" ( as he put it, he seemed uncomfortable to say the word menopause) and that I wanted to know the levels of my bloodwork to know what treatment would help me best.

I have night sweats and hot flashes,thought I had colon canceror ovarian cancer due to changes in bowel movements and bloating but I guess it is just peri menopause. Still have periods  Am trying wellspring serenity bioidentical natural progesterone cream, vitamin B complex and botanical female complex red clover, sage leaf, hop extract to name but a few of the herbs in these tablets which are now a year out of date. Are they still ok to take?  Advice anybody?? I also have Macha powder to put in my yoghurt.    I am.very forget full so usually forget to take and don't like swallowing tablets.. I get panicky every time I go out and ever since my mum killed herself in October feel like I am missing a limb or something equally critical.    Was particularly alarmed by the feeling of fullness before I had eaten much but noticed it comes and goes.Thrre are parallels between thus and more serious health conditions I know but it seems likely to be perimenopause as does rushing to toilet for a pee and mild constipation. I do not think 5 small meals a day should present a problem to keep metabolism up and running also enough excersize unless I get agar aphobic"

I hope it will help to share with others and not feel so alone with it all. I have what I call my coping tools and I write lots of positive lists but some days the fear and dread make it difficult to face the day and I struggle getting out of my flat. I feel safer being home. Symptoms include....dread and fear,exhaustion and feeling so weak that it is an effort to face anything. Breathlessness and panic, bloated and upset stomachs....the list goes on. Also the ocd symptoms which can be debilitating. I would love to hear from others and their similar experiences, it would be such a relief to not feel so cut off it is hard to explain unless you experience it and it helps so much to get things out in the open.

I am 47 now and officially at menopause as per my doctor's saying. I didn't have a period for 18 months now, so she told me I am at menopause. I didn't have any hot flushes. But twice I had blood spottting together with all the PMS symptoms; bloated constantly and the breasts ate very sour and tender. 2 weeks ago when I saw my dr she told me that is not normal to bleed and that if I spot again to go for an ultrasound because it might be ovarian cancer. Now I got again my breasts tender and painful and I spotted today (very little - just a wipe). And I am scared to death to go at the doctor.

I feel so lucky to have found this forum, as it has helped me tremendously these last few years.  I will be 47 in a few months.  Lately my periods have been getting further apart (they used to be like clockwork).  My last cycle was 65 days.  I just recently started my period.  It took a long time to start.  It bgan with very very light brown spotting and after a few days I began to flow heavily with lots of flooding.  I also am dealing with cramps and migraines (I feel like how I felt when I was a teenager and having my period!).  I truly feel like I am going crazy.  I have hot flashes and night sweats, as well.  I feel like crying all the time! My doc had said my progesterone levels were low, but I am not at all interested in hormone therapy.  She wasn't really able to offer me any relief other than suggesting magnesium supplements (which I take regularly) and calcium with vitamin D.  I am also taking a multi vitamin supplement.  Ibuprofen has not really helped much. I am hoping some of you have experienced these issues and can recommend some natural therapies to help me through.

At one point my period time was my best days but now it has reversed , the symptons this month during my period was awful. I was constantly bloated and gassy. Now looking at the menstrual cycle chart, according to chart i would be ovulating this week and this bloating is horrible along with the heart palpitations. My digestion system seem to be all messed up. I was diagnoised with gastritis but i just cant get a break with it. The anxiety is trying to come back and im starting to get depressed and irritability comes sometimes. I feel weak and shaky at times. I was maintaining my weight , but ive noticed ive started to lose again because of the issues. I just want all of this to go away and feel normal again. Just when I start to feel better I get pushed back...its just not fair . Not to mentioned that my life was difficult and stressful to begin with and now this. It seem so unfair it's like I'm constantly being faced with something. I feel scared at times thinking something else is wrong with me, again this happens a certain time of the month. My mind goes non-stop sometimes. I feel nobody in my house understand what I'm going through. My husband is not supportive, he doesn't communicate with me at all. I have other sisters and friends that have gone through the change or is experiencing it now but nothing like what I'm going through.

I am 47 always been regular every 28 days I had one very late period 4 months ago then another on my next due day now it comes on day 32 up to day 38. So in the 2 weeks leading up to my bleed I am anxious, weepy, angry, shaking, I have no worth, I'm filled with dread and doom. It builds up to the point of me feeling like I'm having a breakdown. I could never get on with the contraceptive pill, it made my pmt too bad. I am going to force myself to the nurse ( the nurse who did my smear advised me to see a nurse practitioner rather than a GP) this week. I would like to know if I can request a hormone level blood test on the NHS? I know my visit will result in me in tears and struggling to explain myself. I'm scared to death of HRT but I can't go on like this. I prefer the natural route and don't really take anything other than pain relief but I'm already dreading work next month and feel I need to run away and live in a cave alone.

There are thyroid problems and Type 2 diabetes in my immediate family, but she did say it could all be due to hormonal activity typical of peri.  I've wondered about blood sugar and thyroid for a long time due to family history and was glad that she agreed to order these for me. If anyone here has been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes or thyroid issues, I'd be interested to hear what the symptoms were that prompted you to go to the doctor for testing prior to diagnosis."

rachel13481,2017-08-20T20:37+00:00,Nausea and Insomnia!,"Oh I hate perimenopause.  I slept a whole 2 hours to wake at 2am so nauseous and sick to my stomach.  A horrible odor filled the room that I couldn’t identify although I glanced at my husband with suspicion.  It felt like I was pregnant again but I know that is not possible as I am almost 49! I was quietly suffering without waking anyone up to keep me company.  I decided to use a bit of air freshener to cover the smell in my bedroom.  I hadn’t turned on the lights at this point … so I accidentally sprayed my face and eyes with air freshener.  I stumbled into the bathroom to wash my now burning eyes and switched on all the lights.  I could not fall back asleep after this!  I googled my way through my lonely night for the next 2 hours avoiding any bad news or rare diseases that may explain my condition. I opened all the windows and turned on two fans.  I eyed my husband with little love in my heart as he slept blissfully through all of this.  I fell asleep for only an hour around 4am only to wake even sicker.  And what was that horrible smell?  Finally, I was leaning over my husband sniffing his arms and face.  He opened his eyes which were filled with glowing hope …. hopeful that I had woken in up in the “mood”.  The look faded as I quizzed him about what he ate before he came to bed.  He admitted nothing….. and fell back asleep during my interrogation.   All lights on in the room, computer glowing, windows open and fans blowing.  How can he sleep?!  It isn’t fair. I ate dry crackers and sipped juice in bed knowing full well no baby was due in a few months.  I can’t stand the nausea!  It happened once before for a few days and when it passed I thought it would never come again.  Here I am nauseous and now can’t sleep and with air freshener in my hair.  I want to scream out in the night but it will wake my boys sleeping peacefully down the hall and my husband may really think I am in the “mood” this time. Finally, the sun rose and I had survived the night with the nausea improving.  I dozed off after sunrise to be soon awoken by my sons jesting and laughing about their dad ""nuking"" the bathroom.  I had questions.  The answer was my husband’s late night snack of a sandwich garnished with raw onions. But why am I so nauseous?  And why does everything smell so bad?  Is this normal?  And will my husband ever smell good to me again?"

I had one bad one after drinking a sweet very heavy hot chocolate with chocolate cake one day. Blood pressure felt raised and it took a beta blocker to normalise. Stimulants seem to trigger it and so I avoid all of them. My symptoms are so random can be fine for weeks and then something new crops up. Im 50 periods slightly irregular but roughly monthly and not painful. Seem to have something linking digestion to anxiety and flu like head / dizziness symptoms that randomly appear.

I've been so scared and emotional on this roller coaster of hormones lately that it's nice finding comfort in hearing other stories. So I've been having perimenopause symptoms which include being very tired all the time, even if I've slept well or have had hours of sleep. And I have days where I'm dizzy. If I don't have the dizzy feeling then I have a foggy head. I also have a dull ache in my chest-its usually right between both breasts but the achiness(tightness) can radiate down under my left breast and I'll even start to feel a dull ache in my upper back by my left shoulder blade. This is the scary symptom that has me freaking out. I also get shaky during the day, especially if I try to do too much too fast, which leads me to be wobbly and weak. My symptoms don't ever seem to go away either. They may diminish in intensity during the day but they seem to always be there. Has this happened to anyone else? Where these symptoms can become severe in strength and then diminish at times but never really go away? And does anyone else just feel so darn tired all day? Thank you in advance!"

Anyway, I found some GREAT resources that are legit (forget hormone/coritsol testing, adrenal fatigue and all of that stuff, unless it is giving you a placebo effect, which you could just as easily get from any so-called remedy) and TRUST objective and well-researched resources.

After seeing my PCP, neurologist, allergist, GI doc, and a holistic doctor who put me on about 10 different ""natural supplements"" (all of which did NO GOOD), I found a NAMS-approved (see webiste above for for info. on this) nurse practitioner who prescribed Levora, a mix of estrogen and progesterone.  It is ""the pill,"" but in order to keep my hormone levels stable, I take it constantly with no off days unless I have 4 days of bleeding.  I have had a dramatic decrease in severity and frequency in all of my symptoms. While they still present their ugly heads at times, I haven't had a crying meltdown AT ALL and thoughts of doom are rare.  PLEASE, MOST IMPORTANT, there is SO MUCH mis-information about treatment for perimenopause symptoms, use research-based, valid treatment options. YOU DESERVE IT.  And, other things that have helped:  mindfulness relaxation, massages (yeah!), sharing MY STORY and getting support from family, and knowing I am not alone and am NOT crazy!  I wish all of you the greatest strength and love as we go through this trying time in our lives.  Cherish the peaceful moments and don't listen to the bad moments-they are NOT REAL and are merely symptoms.  Take care!

theresa06691,2017-08-12T21:27+00:00,Peri menopause at 41,"I've recently had bad hot flashes at night, sweating, dizzy, flush...feeling like my head was going to explode! Even went to the ER and the docs diagnosed me with vertigo. Doctors said my blood pressure was borderline 143/93 and decided to medicate me. The side effects that I experienced from the medication made me think I was losing my mind. 3 ER visits ...Needless to say my anxiety rose and so did my blood pressure. I even went to see a cardiologist to run a battery of tests ...heart normal.  I've weaned myself off all BP medicine and doctors still want to medicate but I'm still boarderline. My BP spikes when I have a peri episode...probably cause of my anxiety about this whole new chapter. At least I know my heart is ok. Now when I have an episode...I just breathe through it and let it pass. Nights are the worse....hard to sleep."

About 3 months ago I started having very heavy menstrual bleeding. I've noticed around the same time the heavy periods started I'm getting heart palpatations, shakiness(what feels like from the inside out), I feel dizzy, I have no appetite(sometimes but not always feel nauseous) and I get very emotional when I feel this way because it feels so scary and awful. I've had an EKG and chest xray that came back ok and all my blood work for thryoid and pituitary gland came back ok. But I'm wondering if this is perimenopause symptoms? I have days where I can get hot and clammy out of the blue too. Is there something I should be tested for? A hormone imbalance? I'm so scared. Anyone have any advice, please share. Thank you!"

Ok I know this would usually be the time for my period but so far no show , but I've been having irritation in the private area. Also it looks a little different down there. (Appears to be sort of reddish) Also I noticed a piece of skin or fatty tissue at the end of the inside opening. (More like the side of opening) I do know I got a tear from child birth but this was years ago and don't know if that could be from that.

As some of you know that has been following me, I am not coping well with anxiety - one of the nasties of peri. I can deal with the following symptoms that I have experienced but NOT THE ANXIETY!. Heart palps, hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, sore tongue, painful muscles, hair loss, brittle nails, IBS, intolerance with certain foods, irritability, mood swings, creepy crawly sensation on my scalp, worsen allergies, dry and irritated eyes, loss in libido to name a few.   I am trying to keep a positive mind and have started using a lot of herbal remedies, vit d, calcium and magnesium, multi vitamins and a product called be stress free. I am with a CB Therapist too. I unfortunately have to use xanor as I cannot cope with the anxiety.  As I am reading a lot about all the symptoms, especially anxiety I though it best to share my findings with you all. I found 3 awesome apps that you can download on your phone should an attack creep up on you and also to use these every day to learn relaxation techniques. They are Stop Panic and Anxiety, Break Free and Healing Sounds. Most off all - they are free. Found them to be quite relaxing. Hope all of you have a good day."
lorin2362,2017-08-25T15:05+00:00,"My symptoms, I feel that I am dying or loosing my sanity!","I have posted here a few times over the last couple of years with a couple of symptoms hoping that ladies would jump in and say, ""Oh yeah, I have that too"". I didn't get many responses but the ones I did get were amazingly kind and supportive. I am posting again because I have recently developed new symptoms and I am both terrified and sincerely concerned for my sanity and my life. I am turning 47 next month and I had a partial hysterectomy when I was in my mid 30's keeping my ovaries. I had terrible sickness through my entire one pregnancy being hospitalized on multiple occasions with nausea and vomiting. I have always had terrible PMS and migraines with all of my periods up until my hysterectomy and then the migraines allowed me to track my period afterwards as they continued. When the migraines got almost constant, I got on medication to stop them and have not been able to track period since then. Im sharing my history in hopes that it may look familiar to others. My mother was post menopausal at 50 but she said she felt great other than a few hot flashes. This worries me even more because THAT'S NOT ME! Over the last two years I have developed all of the following symptoms and have been doctor tested for every one with no findings including hormones being in the ""normal"" range. blurred vision migraines sleep problems constant post nasal drainage dizzy spells tinnitus joint, gut and muscle pain fatigue to the point of not even showering feeling like the world is muzzy or how things look in a dream (how you feel with a bad fever) feeling disconnected like nothing is important not even family difficult word recall and reading retention hair falling out like mad (have lost 2/3 rds of my hair volume in two years) nausea and no appetite slow digestion IBS symptoms dry flaking skin on my face even with tons of moisturizer itchy scalp (i want to scratch it with a metal comb) tender, aching, painful, itchy breasts (cyclic) felling like having the flu but not being sick gallbladder pain even though I had it removed a few years ago and the new ones that started this week are weeping spells, flooring depression and anxiety and panic out of nowhere for no definable reason! My brain is sounding all the alarms saying ""YOU'RE DYING!!!, SOMETHING IS TERRIBLE WRONG!!!"" My mind is running wild all on its own like I'm sitting back watching it go mad and I see it happening and I know, at least I think I know that that's not me! Like I'm watching someone else. Im badly struggling with the depression and weeping feeling like I want to end it all which is nuts because I have always been a happy adventurous person. Now Im in the house in pajamas laying on the couch under a blanket or in bed all day for days now not feeling well with the nausea and depression and anxiety and panic. Good grief! I hope that there are ladies here that can share their experiences with me so that I can see that Im not alone and this will pass with time as well as that my list of symptoms can be helpful to others as well. I have read this forum for the last four days straight through. I have lost hope in seeing the other side given all the women who say it never ends or that they have tried to give up HRT but couldn't. Is there no hope or end to this? Or do women eventually feel better and stop coming here to post? Im not feeling very optimistic about seeing the other side. Please help if you can."
michelle50768,2017-08-27T05:36+00:00,Please help!!!!,Hi all I'm at my wits end. Been in this site for nine years during peri.  Went 12 months with no period but a nodule was found in my thyroid so had the right side of my thyroid removed four weeks ago and got a period the day after surgery!!!! My doctor wasn't concerned as it stopped after a week and wasn't heavy. I feel constantly dizzy nausea from hell!!!! I've suffered bad anxiety in oeri but it's back with a vengeance after not being too bad for a while. I feel like it was getting a bit easier and I was officially in menopause but the operation has turned me upside down. Doctors won't test thyroid function for six weeks as it's too early to tell thyroid function. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm crying all the time can't eat feel sick and dizzy just cannot function. I've had two ECGs since my operation due to palpitations and both were fine. I've had some really bad low times in peri but thought I was entering full menopause till this period blip. I don't know if it's hormones or thyroid or anxiety I'm just in a mess I feel so ill. Don't know if anyone has had similar issues but I'm so so down right now I hate feeling sick it brings on anxiety. Thanks for listening ladies x

I don't know if what I'm dealing with is just menopause and will go away if I can hang on til it passes or if I have some really bad issues medically. I lost and can't afford insurance since Obama care so I can't afford to go to a doctor which really sucks because I am so scared! I wake up with horrible pain running through my legs, feet , arms and hands and even after a night of a full 9 hours of sleep. I wake up exhausted, completely unmotivated and feeling like my life is over so why do I keep trying to function? Because forcing myself to go to work will hopefully keep me from. Ring homeless but I'm afraid that is inevitable. I'm not married, have no savings and my career isn't paying what it used to do I'm living with my parents, dad is 79 mom 75, and my older brother who promised to always make sure I'm okay died a tragic death 4 years ago. I keep trying, force myself to get out of bed, my parents are always on my case, they get around better than me, why do I hurt so much? I'm so much younger than them but I'm more tired and in more pain, is it because of menopause, because I'm alone and they have each other?  I'm catholic and believe I must go through whatever happens no matter how hard because suicide would keep me from even having peace after I die but each day it gets harder and harder and I question whether I can make it to the end. Is this normal? Do any of you feel the same, is there hope?"
anna61518,2017-08-27T16:41+00:00,Peri menopause and ibs?,"I'm 46 and seem to be starting peri menopause. A couple of months ago I got painful breasts before and during my period, although I haven't usually had this before, my doctor said it's peri menopause and suggested I take starflower oil. I got a high dose tablet of 1300mg and my symptoms definately were better, but after taking it for 5 weeks I realised it was causing a stomach churning acidy feeling so had to stop taking it. This month I've had wierd symptoms of a very bloated stomach and ibs, but breasts not too bad.

I have a lot of symptoms of hypothyroidism and plenty of peri symptoms, especially after ovary removal last year.  The worst symptoms are weight gain and slow metabolism, even though I walk an average of 2-3 miles daily, anxiety, depression, irregular periods (anywhere from 15-35 days apart), panic attacks, worsened PMS, achy joints and muscles, brain fog, and sometimes sore breasts, also occasional insomnia that has become worse lately.  Recently, I've started having dry mouth with chapped lips and a burning feeling on the tip of my tongue, which also looks redder than normal and is more sensitive than normal.  I took my temperature this morning and it is 96.3.  It has been low on other mornings when I've checked it.  My GI doctor diagnosed a Vitamin D deficiency in May based on bloodwork results.  He also felt the thyroid area and did not find any abnormality.  I have never had a TSH test, though.   Could this be a thyroid problem anyway???  Or is it all peri, or both?

I just would like ladies to know there is light at the end of the tunnel, although you may not feel like that at the moment. Just remember that an unlucky few continue symptoms for eternity, and as time passes they become less bothersome and mild in comparison for the rest gradually disappearing for good. From my research this is normally 2-3 years post meno, fingers crossed. The symptoms I remember are as follows as far as I can recall. 1 year ago/present day No appetite – Eat nothing for weeks on end, just sipped water and ice chips. / Eating normally again Weight loss- lost nearly 2 stone/Back to pre existing weight Nausea- constant day & night for about 10 months/Now none Belching- awful indigestion despite not eating/ As before Insomnia- totally unable to fall or stay asleep got maybe 3 hours a night if lucky/ Sleep well most of the time waking mainly to pee, usually fall back to sleep but awake for a couple of hours occasionally Night sweats- OMG drenched need I say more/ Still get these but sleep through most of them certainly not as bad or as many. Heat Intolerance- This was weird I felt warm all the time 24/7normally cold because of my thyroid, couldn’t bear even a warm shower it had to be cold, the hair-dryer was an absolute no no./ Showering and using hair dyrer as before still get some feelings of warmth but in between feel normal again Flushes- Lasted forever just finish one then start another, either with or without the sweats. No triggers only very sensitive to temperature to surroundings /Gone from around 40-50 to maybe 3-4. Difficulty Swallowing/Eating- Like a lump stuck in throat even taking meds was hard because of gagging but was only actually sick a couple of times/No problems now Tiredness/Exhaustion- probably mainly due to lack of sleep/This has passed Emotional/Depressive- moods were down and very weepy. If I didn’t have such wonderful kids not sure I would bothered trying probably just ended it all ( hate to admit that now)/Still have a few down days but overall much better Confusion/difficulty focusing- very light headed and dazed feeling/ Dizzy now and again memory still poor IBS like symptoms- obsessed with keeping diary of BM/Odd episodes nothing serious Palpitations- happened a lot/ Still get 1 or 2 but not as often Chest tightness- very uncomfortable of course I had angina and heart disease, this was definitely anxiety/ Only get this now and again Pounding heart – I could feel my heart pounding in my chest and hear it in my ears/ All gone tremors/shakes- Shaking externally and internally. The external was like a constant shiver, internal was like an inner bouncing very hard to explain/Completely gone restlessness- couldn’t relax or sit still very jittery/ Can now relax anxiety- WOW never been an anxious person but this was just awful I was googling every little symptom, this made every other symptom worse and lots of crossover symptoms of anxiety itself./ This has gone thank goodness Panic Attacks- Again never had one before very scary, got so I was afraid to go out, talk to anyone or make or receive telephone calls/ None at all now tachycardia (100-140)- due to anxiety/ Back to normal. headaches- terrible pounding every day and night/ Just an odd one now and then head zaps- would happen day and night like a shock in head/ Get one now and again feeling something wrong- convinced I had something terminal, Feeling detached from reality/Feel ok now do not worry about health anymore Dry mouth-couldn’t quench thirst no matter how much I drank/Still get dry some days Feeling of insects crawling over skin/ an odd tickle now and then Muscle tension mainly neck, shoulders & backache, and joints aching especially hips, knees and legs/ Now all fine Skin and hair changes dryer and older looking/ hmm just age!!

mimi65544,2017-08-21T13:37+00:00,tests to ask for at dr appt??,"Hi all.. still struggling here with daily sympotms. Trying to figure out if it is Peri or something else. I have an appt at my gynecologist tomorrow for a consultation. Any suggestions on what to ask for testing? My family dr. ran the basic CBC for my yearly physical and nothing showed up on Estrodiol or FSH. Feeling tired all the time, nausea, headaches, body aches, brain fog, eyes watering like crazy, insomnia and depends on the day a thousand other symptoms! haha... I am normally a positive, happy person but this is getting old and frustrating. Has anyone had blood test ran that showed things I may not think of I can ask dr. to look for?  Bio- identical vs prescription HRT? Appreciate any feedback! Thanks!"

danielle35642,2017-08-19T22:59+00:00,Dietary changes yields big relief!,"I'm prettt encouraged by this very quick relief I seem to have gotten just from a couple basic changes in diet and lifestyle without even yet getting my prescription filled ( I will but now it's not so urgent ) Recently I read about using more natural or raw foods, instead of refined breads and fast food. So out of pure desperation from the agonizing symptoms I was having as much as I love food, I went out and bought veggies, almonds, pistachios, avocados and olive oil, cous cous, etc. Riggt away changed my diet from mostly refined processed foods to mostly natural foods with just a little processed foods. Started drinking more water, less diet sodas, also taking time to do basic stuff like stretch and breathe. I'm really sensitive to everything good or bad, so I guess something as simple as cutting back on refined foods and eating salads and nuts and lentils instead has already cut my hot flashes from about ten severe episodes a day to only maybe 3 mild ones. Also the symptom I was having a lot of discharge has also reduced dramatically now it's only a little, not constant and don't need to wear a maxi pad for it. The anxiety symptoms are less however I have severe ptsd separate from this so that is not going to be cured by diet alone at all however the more menopausal symptoms of getting hot flash then heart palpitations and meltdown mode has reduced. Just wanted to share not to discount the power of natural things like eating more natural foods and breathing"

It's quite worrying as I've also become clumsy.  Sometimes I experience internal tremors and a feeling of weakness.  These symptoms come and go and I was advised to stop stressing.  My doctor doesn't seem to understand that the tremors and the ""not knowing"" is worrying me.  I wasn't worried before this happened.  I was advised to use multivitamins and extra vitamin D3 tablets so I can't understand why I'm still experiencing these problems.  Does anyone else suffer with this and is it part of peri menopause?

tara45078,2017-08-14T18:24+00:00,Perimenopause,"hi everyone, i apologize if if this comes off as ignorant or rambling but it's from lack of sleep.I would like some clarification on what I am going through.  I am 46years old and since June had been having burning pain in what I thought was my urethra. It wasn't. I  never had a UTI in my life so questioned if it was exactly that.  Anyway I was prescribed Bactrim and the pain went away. But  I noticed the odd sensation came back.  Went to a urologist and he did an ultrasound an cystoscope and a urinalysis. All came back normal.  So they sent me to my gynecologist.  My symptoms were sweating heavily, my periods are every 17 days, and my vaginal area feels numb at times with pressure and heaviness.  Did a pelvic exam and no prolapse etc. they are sending me for a transvaginal ultrasound to rule out anything else.  I know this is hormones and part of the change BUT what can I take to relieve this vaginal pain.  They won't prescribe me any hormone treatment because my mother died when she was 35 from breast cancer.  Is there anything I can do? I am raising my 9 year old son alone, after my divorce, and can't function due to lack of sleep. thank you for any advice."

mauiblue,2017-07-29T06:11+00:00,Depression and Menopause/Peri,"So it appears that I have fallen into a rabbit hole of which I am struggling to climb out of. Im almost 53 yrs old, with somewhat regular periods up until 6 months ago, and poof gone. Now I find myself so dark, no joy, no meaning to anything really other than to focus on getting through each day, praying that I sleep, and trying to talk mysef into hope for recovery. My docs after seeing my hormones completely bottom out from estrogen dominance to Zero estrogen, progesterone and T. I briefly tried a few antidepressants which made me feel sooo horribly creepy, I had to stop. I am on a very low dose of bio identical hormones which arent doing anythin. My question is...which way to turn? I feel like it has to be menopause but i dont hear other women with such mental challenges (depression, anxiety) like i am experiencing. I have never had even much anxiety or dperession to speak of with the exception of a few low moods, but now Boom..ive landed somewhere horrible and scary.  Im hearing that bioidenticals arent any better than standard hrt. Im really struggling. How do people hold down jobs in this state? Im barely able to cope with decision making and work and my two boys, its just basically survival at this stage. I dread each night wondering if i will be able to get enough sleep to get through the next day, and i dread dealing with people socially, when before i could handle anything, people, stress, anything! Now i am disenchanted with life and i have to fake it for my kids sake. This is criminal that women should suffer with this. I just feel like my depression is over the top.  Any support would be so appreciated. Blessings to all you women out there who deal with these things... elizabeth"

It can last anywhere from 12-48 hours.  And then I'm fine.  A few months ago I'm almost positive I had a cyst burst.  All the classic symptoms.  I do have the occasional brown spotting before and after my period.  And I know that is common in peri after reading lots of posts on here.  But this month, my period lasted for 10 days...mostly spotting the last few.  Then 10 days later I started having dark brown discharge.  All brown, some clots, some thing that looks like tissue.  I had a really sharp burst of pain that shot up my left side on day 2.  I am having hip pain and low back pain on that side.  I am on day 4 and it's just light still brown spotting.

Fast forward to a little older, I was only 42 and still saddened by fact that even tho I was still pretty young and getting monthly periods although they were a bit lighter (not much lighter but instead of a heavy 5-6 day cycle of bleeding I was having more like mid to light bleeding for about 4 days but still got them every 28 days like clockwork) and we tried and tried no birth control obviously and at my most fertile time around between day 10-14 and after 4 months of that I finally in December had a missing period ... I told him that I was a little late which like I said my periods were 28 days like clockwork so to be even a few days late could be pregnant. What happened then was when I was only about 6 days late before i went for a test, I went to the bathroom and saw something I had never seen before, a small dark reddish brown circle and called my doctor and said it sounded like a blighted ovum??? I don't really understand everything about it but the little I do I guess it means i had gotten pregnant technically but it wasn't going to develop to a embryo or something like that and it always just passes in your urine.. anyways it was very saddening and frustrating to me because I was still pretty young and had periods monthly but wondered even then if the fact my periods were (very slightly lighter) meant I was starting to go into peri?? My periods served no purpose because for the next 7 years I continued to get periods every month although lighter but never could get pregnant..is it possible at only 42 when I was getting a period every 28 days having to wear a pad, it was full bleeding but it was a little shorter cycle, but still 42 seems very damm young to go into peri especially bc I thought I heard if you have had children it's supposed to occur a little later? Also I mean I continued to get a cycle all thru my forties , I even had a couple people remark when I was in mid to late forties they were surprised I still got a cycle. Then at 50 they only came about every 2-3 months some hot flashes, then in about a years time dwindled down to very light periods only every 3-4 months and now i haven't had one in like must be 8 months."

Even though nam on a small dosage and short time, I don't want to have all the horror of peri come back full force.  Any one else have high estrogen?  Or tips on weaning off???

The bloating is so uncomfortable where it makes my back hurt with a burning sensation and sometimes feels like gas or something moving in the back. This usually occurs after my period leaves and stay until next period. I do suffer with gastritis/gerd I don't know if this could be causing it or what. But it is so uncomfortable. I'm noticing mid section looks and feel so fat ,I dont know if it's from bloating. Sometimes bloating seems to come and go throughout the day. I get relief sometimes by lying on my stomach and usually gas releases which decrease the bloating and back ache. This peri stuff is really getting to me., just when I think symptons have ease or left then its back or some other sympton is back. It's really messing with my mind..its too much😓"

Stomach felt warm which radiated to chest and neck and heart palpitations...also felt a really strange sensation in my head like I was going to black out or something horrible was going to happen. Never felt this before so terrified me. Called 999 as thought I was about to have a heart attack or something similar.. embarrassing as am usually always fit and we'll.

Then about a year ago I started to occasionally have haveh more heavy sweats at night about a week before my menstrual cycle begins. Then I started sweating off and on through the month during the day a few times. No hot flashes, normal periods . Now for two months I am constantly sweating constantly damp on my upper body do much my shirt feels slightly damp . I am having night sweats every time I sleep and even if I nap during the day . It is extremely heavy sweating while sleeping. Also this week I started sweating above my upper lip area. My thyroid levels are supposed to be normal and I have no diabetes. My underlying conditions are multiple sclerosis and I suffer from a fast heart beat that I'm having evaluated . I can't exercise or exert myself much because I get short of breath possibly because of my rapid heart beat that worsens with activity.

amy602,2017-08-01T12:45+00:00,Need some Peri advice.,"HI there.   I wanted to see if anyone could help me with this issue.  Back in Dec my OBGYN put me on birth control to help with some peri symptoms, the pill did start to regulate my period for a few months, & did help subside some of my symptoms, then from March to July no period, I started my next set of BC in the middle of July and then 10 days in I had very little bleeding and the color was brown, this lasted for 2 days and then the color changed to red and flow became heavy.  Once it changed to heavy is when my symptoms of feelling ill, upset tummy, sobbing, leg cramps etc started to happen. Now Im 8-9 days in and still bleeding but the flow is slowing down and im starting to feel somewhat normal. Not totally 100 percent but alot better than what I was.  So what I was wondering is why I got my period while on the pill, and why my symptoms were stronger than normal during this time?  I really think that me finally having a period after 4 months, which prob affected my hormones is what caused all of this to happen to me.  I was just wondering does this sound correct?  I know that our hormones are all over the place during peri so anything is poss.  Thanks for all your help.  I would be lost if I didnt have all of you to help.

alice1209,2017-07-23T01:17+00:00,"Menopause, Anxiety or Cancer???!","Hi all.... I've listed about this before but is seems like my saga continues. I'm 49 and after having streaky blood in my discharge for about two weeks I decided to go to the doctor.... my usual doctor wasn't available so I saw a different GP. I've been on citalopram for 8 years now for my health anxiety that came after the birth of my second child. Anyway, I explained the problem to the GP and she immediately said we better take a Pap test, I said I'd had one 5 months ago and thought it may be menopause related, she stated that as my periods have been regular to date, it can't be that, and she was more concerned about cervical cancer....so of course that sent my health anxiety in in to total overdrive!!! I then explained to her about my increased anxiety and mild panic attacks... and the feeling of being detached, unable to sleep, she then said my anxiety was worsening and I had to see a psychologist... So, my periods started yesterday ( 5 days early), not quite normal, they seem to be starting and stopping... but I have the usual cramps and sore back etc.., however I'm now in a state of constant anxiety as I'm convincing myself I have cervical cancer ( even although I have a pap every year and they have always been clear) and its not the menopause .... !! Any advice please ladies!"

Hot flashes and No energy....when is this going to get better?,"Hi ladies, It has been a little while since I've posted because I've actually been doing pretty good.  My gastritis has improved but it seems like when one symptom improves another one kicks in! I really thought I was getting through menopause without suffering from hot flashes but I was wrong.  I pretty much have them through the night, some nights I wake up 6 or 7 times. This goes on for about a week and then they taper off to a few times a night.   I don't have many throughout the day but do often have a few in the evening....and always after I eat chocolate. ??   I also have been suffering from low blood pressure...I've had high blood pressure since mid twenties so this is surprising to me,  By low I mean a systolic from 92-106 and my diastolic runs 78-89.  It's the top number that is running low and even though this is technically considered hypotension, for me it feels like it.  I get lightheaded, spacey feeling, really tired and when I exert myself my heart rate speeds up.  Heart tests all normal....ECG, echo cardiogram, stress test and even had heart CT scan with dye injection which showed no blockages and calcium score of zero. I am 56 years old and 1 1/2 years ago had partial hysterectomy so still have ovaries and have no idea if I am in complete menopause or not. I am just tired of feeling so tired and dragged out and am wondering if any ladies here have had issues with low blood pressure and fatigue?  Thanks so much.🙂"
judi40048,2017-07-31T13:18+00:00,Postmenapause Bleeding,Hi!! I'm new to this site but I hope someone might can help me. I haven't had a period in 16 months. About a month ago I noticed lower back pain but really didn't think anything about it. Last Tuesday night it was really bad almost like I had a catch or something but I just ignored it. On Thursday night I spotted and it continued thru Friday. By Saturday morning I was seeing a little more blood so I ran out to buy some panty liners. By Sunday morning I am having a full force regular period with of course the back pain and a few clots along with the bloating feeling. I did call my Dr's office on Friday and was told then was not normal that I would need to be seen. So I have an appointment this afternoon. In the meantime I have researched and one site I get scared to death and other places I feel more at ease that this might be normal for some of us. I had a biopsy done in 2015 due to my uterus was thick she said and I had a couple of polyps. The biopsy came back fine at that time and she wanted to remove the polyps to help with the heavy periods but I decided to leave them alone. Now I'm really worried that something is really wrong just because of this lower back pain over the last month or so and now I'm having this horrible period. Has anyone else had these issues with the lower back pain followed by a heavy period that ended up being uterus cancer? I'm a little nervous about my appointment this afternoon cause I know she will do another ultra sound and a biopsy. I just wished she wouldn't do anything but schedule surgery. Just go ahead and get this stuff out before it causes more issues.

I was told by doctors I am in menopause.   I am getting wierd feelings,have been for years now.  These usually come on rather fast and frequently start with a feeling of unexplained anxiety.  Other symptoms vary but can include tight muscles, nausea, weak limbs, hot (not sweating), fast heartbeat, overall weakness. Sometimes I can feel sensations starting in my lower body and feel them rising toward the top of my body.  Usually happens at night in bed, middle of night, sometimes wakes me up.  Doesn't last long, maybe 1-3 minutes.   I know this sounds like typical anxiety but it is not emotional or stress type anxiety, as it has more physical symptoms and happens from nowhere. I also am hypothyroid, Prediabetic, Rhuematoid Arthritis.  These feelings started maybe 3-4 years ago.   Also I don't get hot flashes with sweating ever, but am frequently hot."

synaesthAsia,2017-07-23T23:53+00:00,bad Insomnia/wird sleep patterns what to do?,"Hi ladies. It looks like I need advice for yet another one of these horrible perimenopause symptoms. A month ago I started having very bad anxiety/health anxiety, worry about my heart and terrible insomnia. I always had the anxiety on and off but last month they escalated to unbearable hights. I went to a naturopathic doctor and she gave me a very expensive practitioner's only brand of pills that have many good vitamins and plants, black cohosh, St John's wort, Kudzu, calcium, B vitamins,folic acid. For sixty dollars a continer (a month's supply), I felt really good with my anxiety. They calmed me down, my health anxiety was dormant and I felt energised and stronger.I still do actually, given the circumstances. Alas, they did nothing at all for my insomnia. Nothing, nada, nix. I can fall asleep easily but wake up after 3 hours every night, without fail and just can 't get back to sleep. I twist and turn for a couple of hours, I sleep again for another hour or two, a sleep full of weird, vivid dreams, sometimes nightmares, sometimes plain weird and that's it. What makes it harder is that I have to wake up at 5 every morning to go to work. I am asleep by 10, wake up at 1 stay awake till 3,sleep again until 4-5 and then it s time to wake up. Sometimes I get so frustrated that I have panic/anxiety attacks when I wake up. Most of the times I just try to relax. I have tried listening to meditations, do deep breathing, nothing really works. Surprisingly enough I do not feel as exshausted as one would expect, I think it's the very expensive pills at work but hey, I can't go on like this for ever. I need to regain my six hours of undisturbed sleep back. Any experiences, advice, suggestions much appreciated. I will buy magnesium citrate and triptophane, I am already taking L theanine and rhodiola. I don't drink coffee, my diet is generally clean and I exercise 3-4 times a week. I will NOT go down the sleeping pills road and I don' t want to take hormones be it bioidentical or not. Have any of you been there? What did you do to battle your insomnia? Did it work? Does anything work after all?"

I am really worried now, that what I am experiencing may not be hormone related at all and may be something more concerning.  Today I had 5 incidents of really worrying short term memory loss which is really frightening me now in case it could be early dementia or something. I dont feel myself at all.  It all started in September with feeling really weird and spaced out.  After a few weeks this seemed to improve slightly, but am now back to feeling really strange again.  I called a friend by the wrong name today, couldn't remember which was the headlight dial in the works vehicle...which I drive every single day, literally couldn't recall having taken a plate out to the kitchen like 1 minute previously.  Went to the loo, then went to get my plate to take to the kitchen.  My friend said ""you just took it out"".  Now I just feel really frightened what is happening :-(((("

Guest,2017-07-14T11:56+00:00,Perimentalpause,"Hi everyone Help.  I have recently discovered Perimenopause.  Not because I'm going through it - but my partner is.  We are both female which may, I hasten to add, exacerbate the effects on both of us. I should make it clear at this point that my partner is in total agreement with me writing here - she knows exactly what I'm saying.  I would never belittle her in any way, but we are both pretty humorous people (well we were before PM loomed it's filthy head anyway), and this transition is having a serious negative impact on our lives.  We are trying to introduce humour, but it really isn't funny very often.  (I am trialling a new blog to see if there is anybody out there who is feeling the same way ? ).   My partner is 46 and we have been together for 8 years.  I am 34.  She has always been a fun loving, caring, low maintenance great girl.  In recent years she has started to turn into what can only be described as a monster.  Neither of us were aware of the hell that is Perimentalpause.  I had begun to become used to her ""mood swings"", simply attributing them to ""hormones"" (us females love the phrase ""time of the month"" hey""!).  However, one night -  I'll call it ""Meringue night"", I realised that this may be something more sinister than your average ""Aunt Flo"" is visiting time of the month. We were ""happily"" making Easter meringues for my partner's sister's friends.  We were chatting away and decorating them at the table, and then my partner dropped hers, face down on the floor.  What followed fully introduced me to the world of Jekyll and Hyde that Perimenopause causes.  My partner, having been laughing hysterically only 47 seconds prior, looked at the floor and started to cry.  I said, ""Don't worry baby, it's just a meringue"", to which she replied, ""well it's not just a meringue is it"", started to sob and then farted and walked away.  I thought, ""oh s**t, there is something more up here than regular PMT"". That's the worst thing about it - she has never suffered from PMT.  It's just that since she hit her mid - 40s, she has become a weeping, shouting, farting monster for a few weeks of the month.  How is this fair?!  I never know whether to get her a tissue, a toilet roll or give her a Gaviscon.  I don't know from one minute to the next whether she's going to love me to the point of weeping or scream at me to the point of me weeping. ?Her symptoms have ranged from minor to MAJOR, and include the following: ?- anxiety (this is the worst one for her - she never used to panic about anything and now she can barely climb the stairs or get on or off a train at certain times of the month) ?- reflux (she just belched upstairs so that prompted me to write this one down next) - tinnitus ?- itchy skin (really bad) ?- SEVERE mood swings - cold sweats (they are rancid and make her feel like she's dying) ?- heightened sensitivity to allergies.  She's never had hayfever and yet the past couple of years she literally has had it all year round.  We discovered Piriton, which helps, but knocks her out as it makes her so drowsy.  - wind (seriously, WTAF?!?!) ?- crushing fatigue - breathlessness ?- increased sex drive leading up to ovulation (not complaining!), and then decreased for the rest of the month - lethargy ?- apathy (this is heartbreaking for me to see - she was SO full of life and positivity before this s**t hit) ?Is this really it for the next few years?  We think it's been going on for approx 3/4 years already.  She has regular periods and so we know a GP won't be able to ""do anything"".  She is literally on about 9 vitamins a day.  We have both felt despair, hopelessness and helplessness.  We are intelligent, funny women, but this Perimenopause hell is slowly transforming the pair of us into exhausted, emotional wrecks who don't know which way to turn.  Is there anybody out there in a similar situation? Click here to view image"
looloo43,2017-06-27T12:46+00:00,anyone had ablation & it improved pain?,"i am 1.5 years into peri & have had progressive prolonged & irregular bleeding for last 2.5yrs.  most recently the chronic pelvic pain is virtually constant even when i am just spotting/not bleeding/bleeding. i even lost 2 days off work last week as the amount of pain relief i had to take just to take the edge off pain rendered me unable to drive/work & i ended up in bed curled up with a wheat heat pad over my pelvis. i had a failed ablation attempt(novasure) in may, & am now waiting for another op date to attempt again & if novasure fails they are going to do a transervical resection ablation procedure. i just wanted to know if anyone that has chronic pelvice pain even when just lightly spotting or no bleeding has had an endometrial ablation procedure & found it improved their pain as well as calmed down the irregular prolonged bleeding.  i am finding the pain increasingly hard to cope with with a ""workable"" amount of pain relief & this is the number one thing i need to overcome now. thanks for any info/comments in advance ladies. xxx"

For the last few months I've been really tired and I assumed I was a bit run down. Over the last few weeks though, it's got worse. I'm exhausted all the time, it can take a while to get to sleep at night which doesn't help and I could sleep all day. I'm struggling to get up in the morning and this last 2 weeks I've slept through my alarm 3 times! Even if I have a lie in my head feels kind of stuffy and I have no energy. I've also had a headache (a dull stiff achy one) every day. I've also been really hot, especially my head, which isn't like me. My periods are fine but my mum said it could be peri. Could it be?"

I have had quite a few over the past year. Well today for the 1st time I had such bad gas pain in my chest for a few minutes that after it passed I went into a small aniexty/panic attack and didn't feel good. I had to lay down for about 15 mins and it passed. I felt ok for awhile and then had a lot of gas in my tummy. UGH. I took a gas x pill but this gas is still hanging around in my tummy which I can deal with its just driving me nuts. I got up to do something a little while ago and got a sharp pain in the bottom part of my breast. This lasted about a minute or 2 and then went away. I now have a little soreness on other side of.fhe same breast. I have never had any issues in the breast area. Ugh why now. Im.assuming that this pain is because of my hormones. I was wondering if anyone else has this issue as well as what you do for the excessive gas. Thanks so much.
Nolegirl,2017-07-13T05:55+00:00,Did anyone's symptoms seem to just hit overnight?,"I'm 48 years old, and I have had symptoms creep up on me that I suspect were perimenopausal for the last few years. Nothing too terrible...just a general feeling of blah. I was feeling a bit relieved thinking ""if this is the worst of it, I can do this.""  Needless to say, that must have just been the opening act to The Big Show. I woke up one morning about 6 weeks ago to the most horrible nausea, panic attacks and crying jags that last until noon.  WTH?  Almost overnight, I have changed into a sobbing, weepy mess. I can barely function until noon most days which makes the sadness worse so it is a viscous cycle. I'm on Paxil (3 days in) which has helped my moodiness immensely, but makes the nausea 10x worse. Again, a viscous cycle.  Anywho, I hope this bit of peri leaves as quickly as it came."

lelawreck,2017-07-10T07:21+00:00,Panic disorder or perimenopausal?,"I was diagnosed with depression and severe panic disorder at the age of 27. This came after a 3 year struggle of not being able to concieve due to endromitiosis. I eventually got precnant but had a misrable precnancy and threaten to miscarry on 3 months. With a lot of prayers, hormone injections - as my placenta ruptered, bed rest etc, my baby girlwas born. At 3 months old she got meningitis and almost died. A few months after that I got precnant again but lost the baby. I was then informed that I will never be able to concieve again and my womb was 3 times bigger than its normal size, twisted and full of grows. I had a histerectomy on the young age of 27. Shortly hereafter the depression kicked in. i went for therepy use anti depressants and xanor for the panic disorder. After a year I slowly began to get of the anti depressants. I had a stressfull life style, having my own account bussiness and married to an Auditor with his owen bussiness. We slowly grew apart and the last 8 years of our marriage was a living hell. He filed for divorce - I was 36 now. We had been togheteher for 18years. Once again I fell into depression and panic disorder. As I knew all the signs it was easier to control and found a lovely man that supported me in this, we are still together. I was fine again. About a month ago i got very sick and ended up in bed for 2 weeks. All of a sudden the panic disorder came back again. The worts ever. I do not know what triggerred this? My heart will run away then have this pounding beat, so severe that I will feel like fainting. I have nigh sweats, chills, shiverring, muscle pain, etc. If my heart beats irregular this will have an effect on the panic and even makes it worse as i feel like dying. Once again I am on xanor to control the anxiety. I went to my gp whom suggested a view blood tests. I am still waiting for the results. I find it intressting that some of you mentioned peri-menopausel. I was already informed that I am in this stage last year with a routine visist. I cannot use HRT as according to my gyne I am to young yet and due to the fact that we have breast cancer on both families side. I feel so powerless. This is by far the worst panic that I have experienced. And these heart pulpitations is so nerve recking. Just knowing that some of you are experiencing similar symptoms makes this situation more bareable. Please just excuse my spelling errors. English is not my firts language."

My yoga teacher left and it was too expensive to continue the weight class. I do stretching exercises every day and I do pray. I just feel like my body and my mind are betraying me. Also sometimes I feel numbe down there, but that may be from the lidocaine in the fissure ointment.  Those two areas are in very close proximity to each other. Am I crazy?

Now I don't wake up in the night, but I am tired the rest of the day.  Joints ache throughout the month also. Currently I am on Day 11 of my cycle.

Vision exam went ok, only need glasses. The medical part not ok. He said the optic nerve of my eyes are thinner than an average person. He said I can be just born that way because they are the same size. Because I did so well on glaucoma test, he doesn't suspect it. Now, I'm freaking out, I'm going to see an ophthalmologist. I can't take this no more!! My period has left and now my back hurts like crazy. It's feel like pressure on it and burning sensation at the same time. On top of that my stomach feels like it's going to burst open from being so bloated and heavy. I literally can't take this no more!!! I'm tired of complaining to my friends and family because I know they are tired of hearing me...As I write this I am crying because I feel like I am suffering. Even my girlfriends that's going thru peri also don't understand because they are not experiencing all of these symptons. I'm also experiencing lightheadness, and being off balance when I walk.

She complains of feeling very hot, both inside and out (difficult to describe). She has lost all interest in sex, and she seems to get tired and sleepy very easily. I've urged her to make an appointment for a checkup, but she's always been the type that never goes to the hospital unless she's dying. Is anyone here experiencing this? Do the symptoms sound familiar? Is there anything I can do, short of dragging her to the doctor's office?"

This past month I had a heave period a one week break (with some pinikish brown spotting) another three day period and now I'm spotting brown sometimes red. I've been to the docs and he said took blood tests and has booked me a pap. I'm also exhausted and can't be bothered to do anything. In fact my favorite day is to lie on the couch with my dogs eat as much sugar as possible and NOT talk to anyone haha. I haven't had the pap scan yet but ive looked at the symptoms and cervical cancers seems very similar to early menopause (I am in no pain) I'm just interested in other women's experiences

The pain was excruciating and I am pretty tough but this was off the chart. I told the female doctor it was unbearable and she hardly reacted some comment about maybe me being dry. This is not acceptable that any woman post menopause or younger should be expected to endure this amount of pain. It is time the medical profession investigates painless method of pat smear. Women are being turned off the procedure because of this. Has anyone else experienced this. I am 59 years old and have given birth to two children so know pain but this was off the chart.

And what about the persistent off-balance feeling that I seem to have whenever the tension strikes? My head just feels so heavy...as though my poor neck can barely support it. I had a massage last night and the therapist was astonished at how tight my muscles were, especially on the sides of my neck, behind my ears, and in my shoulders....all related?

I go to the gym 4x during the week and have PT twice per week. Weight gain at that rate could've only been due to the tabs. I stopped. But all the horrible menopause stuff came back - dryness, no libido. Has anyone else had this sort of reaction to the treatment and should I go back on the tabs and hope that it evens out?

Its like i have lost my MOJO big time. I feel like a scared child most of the time.. find it hard to make decisions. Im second guessing myself all the time too.  Maybe its something to do with the constant changing in symptoms that makes planning anything impossible. You never know how you are going to feel from hour to the next as it can change so quickly. Im sure there is a brain chemical issue at the route of it all as i randomly have periods of feeling almost normal and my confidence returns. Anxietys still a big issue but having lived with chronic anxiety throughout my life due to having Hyper Pots , its never stopped me doing things.  Anyone else feel this is a huge issue.. any meds that have worked etc?"

Missmira,2017-06-27T22:08+00:00,Losing Faith and feeling hopeless....and then period MIA,"Im sorry. I'm so sorry to anyone who is willing to read this.I just dont know where else to let this out. For over two years I have been struggling with what may be perimenopause stuff. I'm about to turn 48...but never felt like i was aging before the last two years. Yes at 40 my hair got drier and my skin but everything else felt the same. Then two years ago everything suddenly crashed and I didnt recognize my body. Never had much anxiety now I do...especially health anxiety. Ive been through tons of blood tests, MRI's, ultrasounds...drs after drs. The only thing we have found so far is that i struggle with vitamin D deficiency and have two bulging disks in my lower back and one in my neck. im in physical therapy for those and its been better. I found out about those because my Neurologist ordered the MRI to rule out demylinating disease because i was having tingling and numbness in my hands and legs.  So for the past few months I though I was on my way back to normal. I started back at church and even started a food ministry in my area. Then last month I decied to see my Gastro Dr about my constant weird pressure below my ribs...feels like i always have air in there. they wanted to do a endoscopy and then at the same time colonoscopy since im close to the recommended age anyway but didnt seem overly concerned. I had a terriblly stressful week and and then the two days on liquids made me almost pass out. I couldnt even do the prep so i had to cancel.  The last few months my periods that have always been very regular and 28 days started coming every 21 days. my doctor says thats normal to be shorter...but then now...my period has disappeared. My procedure would of been this past monday and my period was due friday..so its 5 days late. Thats only ever happened when i had my kids and thats not a possibility for this. Then the last few days the dizziness and nauseas and unsteadyness has come back...and my brain is so foggy I cant even think. Months ago I did two saliva tests and they showed slightly elevated estrogen in comparison to what it should be against progesterone. I guess why Im feeling hopeless is because i got a taste of feeling normal again just to fall back into this pit. I dont know if its the clear liquid diet that triggerd this or the stress thats been pretty bad to be honest for almost a month.  Im ashamed for my teenage daughter to see whats become of the strong stable mother she used to have. I try to hide it but I really cant anymore.  Ive taken tons of vitamins...use magnesium oil every day...drink chamomile tea at night to relax...drinking it now with ginger to calm the nausea and dizziness...but its only temporary.  I feel like I dont recognize this woman I've become..who just wants to lock herself in a closet away from the world and cry, and I am so ashamed. I don;t even feel like I can go to church any more because how ungrateful I am for even complaining about how I feel when I know there are people struggling with much more. Thank you and a hug to all of you Mira"

Started bleeding lightly on and off about a month later which has carried on about two thirds of the time. Had a pelvic ultrasound 3 weeks ago which shows that my womb lining is 8.3. Over 5 apparently means a referral to a gynaecologist for biopsy to test for womb cancer. Have only just got the result from GP (as I have been on holiday) who has referred me for an emergency appointment but looks like the earliest I will be seen on the NHS is next Friday. Trying to work out the likelihood of the thickening being due to the HRT, in which case I will worry less and just wait for the NHS appointment... going privately this week for hyperoscopy would cost me around £1500 - £2000, which I really don't have. Any thoughts please? Will another week make much difference? Is there any evidence showing HRT can cause womb lining to thicken?"

Cforce,2017-06-27T01:50+00:00,Headaches after period...anyone else? (peri),"Hi all! I've been reading through these posts for a few weeks now, but haven't posted. They have been a mental LIFESAVER for me to say the least, can't believe how many people have all these crazy symptoms. I never knew what hormones could do to you until now! My ""gripe for tonight"" (lol) is the HEADACHES. Ugh!  Just wondering if anyone else experiences pretty rough headaches a day or two AFTER your period? I've read a few things in passing it seems, about others who have some pretty icky symptoms after rather than before (or both) so I'm curious how common it is.  Since I've seen so many others do it..I'll list my lovely symptoms so far... Overall feeling of just YUCK... Super anxiety, (never really had anxiety before)....which I'm pretty sure brings on the symptoms listed below....   Heart palp   Headaches   Dizzyness   Fullness in ears (this one is often, drives me nuts)    Feeling like I can't get enough air in (which causes, and comes with, anxiety)   Feeling like there's something in my throat....subtle, but there   Those lovely feelings of ""tingling"" on my head ""almost dizziness"" (anyone every get this?....like a feeling that you're ABOUT to lose balance, or like you're eyes are ABOUT to go unfocused but don't actually?)  Random ovulation pains on either side throughout the month.  Weird back aches, almost like a kidney issue, but no other  ""kidney symptoms"" I'm still pretty regular every month, but did notice that after these symptoms started (about 4 months ago) I was either starting a little bit late or a little bit early.  I'll be 47 this year.  I've felt better mentally since noticing that SO many other women have these symptoms, but that doesn't change the fact that they're still here and it's still a struggle.  I also dont' have medical insurance so I can't run to the doctor for every little thing, so this board has helped incredibly.  Thank you ALL who post on here, it's really a blessing to have these to read!"

I have always had breast pain before my period, but this time it did not go away after the period (for the first time ever). My gyn said it was an anovulatory cycle. I'm 49.  The pain is equally in both breasts - I'm not worried about cancer, although I will have my regular checkup - and it feels like permanent PMS. I'm concerned it might not go away after the next period as well. It feels very much like a hormonal thing. The only other peri symptom I have is irregular bleeding.  Has anyone had this experience and knows how to treat it?"

Every morning for two weeks, I have felt pukey and had full blown panic and crying jags.  I seriously can not live like this. I am training for two half marathons in the coming months and my running has hit a wall.  I can't get through a run without either throwing up/gagging or being overcome with heat. It is really messing with my training and consequently, throwing me into a terrible depression. Any other runners in the forum experience this?  This nausea is the absolute worst. I'm flying home next week and will be on a plane for close to 12 hours, and I am having legit panic attacks about the flight. My doctor has prescribed Zofran which helps but it isn't the answer. Not sure my point in posting, but I needed to cry in someone's shoulder for a bit with people that don't think I'm nuts.  I'm truly feeling trapped in a body/brain that I just don't recognize."
Struggling50,2017-06-21T04:50+00:00,Tinnitus and hearing loss,"Hello, everyone. I am new here. I have been reading your posts and it has helped me so much. It helps to know that I am not alone in this perimenopausal mess. Has anyone else here experienced tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo or thumping in their ears? Two months ago I developed tinnitus in both ears but much worse in the right ear. It sometimes rings, roars, buzzes. The hearing in the right ear is diminished. Sometimes there is a thumping in the right ear when I swallow. It is not a popping sound. It sounds like someone is hitting my eardrum with a little mallet. Like the sound of a Native American Tom Tom drum. Sometimes it doesn't happen at all. Also sensitivity to sound. I'm not sick with an Ear infection or sinus infection. The doctors have called it Sudden Sensineural Hearing Loss. But it happened when I started having bad perimenopausal symptoms. Also clearing my throat a lot. It feels like there is something in my throat but there isn't anything there. The throat clearing may be anxiety. Anyone else having symptoms like this? Thank you."

My husband , daughter and myself stayed away in a hotel overnight Thursday into Friday as I went with my daughter Abbie to see take that . The concert was amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed , but then I came back to earth with a jolt . As I got back to the hotel I started this migraine and I think a bit of a panic attack , as I was shaking also . Anyway I had to go out to the car as the room was so hot ( I'm also getting bad hot flushes at the moment ) . I couldn't get any air as the window would only open a crack , so no air was circulating . I think this only made the situation worse . Anyway sorry to ramble , but I need to explain the situation .We got back by 10.30 Friday morning , I went straight to bed as luckily I had the day off work , but my husband had to go to work . I slept all day , got up for a while then went back to sleep on the sofa and stayed there all night . Went to work Saturday although I still felt really rough . The thing is my migraines are hormonal , so I can't do much about that and I'm not putting it on , I really do feel like death when it comes on , but it seems to me like my husband has the hump with me , really short or just not speaking to me at all . My daughter , who is 21 commented on his mood . I really feel like I must be getting on his nerves and a burden . All I want is a hug and to be told everything's going to be ok . It's coming up to the anniversary of my mums death , 2 years in the 30th of June and I so wish she was here to help me through this and it's Father's Day and I lost my dad 10 years ago . I will be 50 in august . Sorry to go on , but I feel so upset at the moment ."

My IBS has gotten worse because of it.  I was diagnosed 12 years ago with it.  I am wondering if anyone experiences a lot of gas and bloating? but most of all if anyone feels a tightness or an ache or stitch around there mid back and raps around to the ribs.  They feel sore and achey.  Also sensative to touch down on both sides of my belly button and lower back also.  I have had three colonoscopies, two endoscopies, biopsy of colon tissue, pelvic sonogram, vaginal sonogram and internal exams from gyno.  All Normal! Just want to see if I am crazy, or if other people have experienced this.  I was given Vicodin for the pain on bad days.  Could the Vicodin be causing worse gas and bloating because it slows down your intestines?"
synaesthAsia,2017-06-18T00:53+00:00,"Perimenopause rant, horrible symptoms on the loose","Hello everyone. I have been following discussions on this forum for more than a year now and it has been extremely helpful when the going gets so tough that you don t wanna go anymore but you know that you can t just stop either. My story: 46 years old with horrible physical, emotional, mental symptoms. It all started escalating a year ago when I went through a bad break up and moved to a huge, bustling, hot, sticky South East Asian metropolis for work. The heat and humidity are extreme year around. It's very hard to make friends, everyone around me is sorted with parteners and family, distances are very long, it takes hours to get from A to B, plus it s noisy, fast paced and very vain. All that conbined with my roller coaster hormones have kept me in a constant state of discomfort and that's on my good days. I have had severe anxiety and depression, hot flashes magnified by the heat, palpitations, insomnia  and most importantly noone to talk to. On top of all I have developed extreme health anxiety due to not having anyone to share my thoughts with and constant ruminating, searching my body for strange lumps, bumps and sensations, which as we all know there are plenty in peri and the heat doesn't help either. I ve had tests and I m perfectly fine and also very fit (used to be a dancer, practicing yoga every day). I ve been taking theanine and rodhiola for my mood, which kind of, sort of helps, b complex and co q10 to protect my heart from all the (involuntary) workout that anxiety gives it.  A couple of weeks before my period things get so bad that I don t know if I can take it anymore but I know that the only way is to take it because what? This Sunday morning I woke up in panic after a very bad night's sleep because they are having a party at the temple accross the street and they started blasting silly pop hits from the speakers at 6 in the morning. It brought me to the edge! On an impulse I ordered natural progesterone cream to try but I m really scared of it because of all the controversy surrounding them . That's it basically. I just wanted to add my story to the hundreds of similar stories that all of you have posted here and maybe get some feedback from you. Thanks for reading. Hasta la libertad!"

Well now this month, for the 1st time in 8+months I got leg cramps, tingling, a little depressed, crying/sobbing (once), etc.   Its like all the beg symptoms I had almost a year ago started to come back just not as strong.  I also have not had my period in 3 months and dont know if that is causing some of this or not.    All these symptoms this month started just right after my cycle (if I had one this month).  I was hoping that maybe I am coming out of peri the way I went in almost a year but am starting to think that is just wishful thinking.  Any thoughts?   Thanks in advance."

manuela67667,2014-12-01T03:22+00:00,"Full blown Perimenopause, low estrogen, low mood, HRT, Antidepressants or just sit it out?","Hi I so far just been active reader in this forum and soooo thankful to have found it as it really calms, helps to know that others go through the same thing.... I am just 41 and had 2 years ago started to have irregular periods, I had a swollen lymphnode under my right armpit so I eventually went to the GP about it. Since I was ÿoung he thought I was pregnant but I got him to do hormone testing as I just had ""a feeling"". Anyway the bloodtest result was that the FSH was on 110, can not remember the other values. Anyhow the GP said all is ok, nothing out the ordinary???! And left it at that. So off I went, but then did my research and found out FSH 110 is not ordinary. So I contacted a Gyno via email andhe suggested to go back to the GP and to tell him to take such and such bloodtests and also to have a pelvic ultrascan done. So I did that, and it turned out I had a quite large uterine polyp. Had that removed last year in Oct. through the public system (I live in Australia, no private healthinsurance). The Gyno at the Hospital is a very nice guy so he's been very concerned that I find out and get some help with my ""mood"" swings etc. Perimenopause that time has not been confirmed. Incidentially a few months later on I met a lady in her 50's and I said to her that I must have hormonal problems as I feel ""off"" (little crazy, irrational thoughts, anxiety etc, mind you I always have been prone to them, but not in that extend I have it now!). She gave me an address of a GP who also does bioidentical hormones, and is very in the Gyno side of things. So I went to see her in June and we did the full blood tests. As I havent had my period regulary we just picked a day. The FSH was on 125 , oestrogen 390 and progesterone 1.So I got prescribed 10% progesterone cream (bioidentical) and I then had every 4th week my period. Mind you, I went up onto 20% on my own accord as mind wise I feelt totally off. Like depressed, anxiety, irrational thoughs, ocd thoughs, brain fog and low energy. I usually used to get better (not good but better as in acceptable) when I got my period, than the week after and then it all started again downhill. That was until about 2 months ago. The whole pattern changed, I got worst getting my period, and then better after the bleeding and then erratic throughout the rest of time until next bleeding when I go and hit rock bottom again. I supsected, and its now confirmed, that my estrogen levels have dropped also. On day 21 my estrogen is on 80 pmol/l and my fsh is on 125, I have rised the progesterone to 12 nmol/l No I don't know but anyhow this all sucks big time. I am good and bad from day to day or changing within the day. Yesterday morning I was feeling like my old self, just to go down at 4 pm and still am crap. I have no energy and feel zoomed out, I cry on the drop of a hat etc. but as I said it can be better tomorrow again but all in all I wonder now what I should do.....???? I have been prescribed an antidepressant, but not taking it now. Mind you I have been on one the last few years (due to anxiety (knowing what I know most likelyl made heaps worst as I've already started peri then!)  and a few months ago, even upping the dose I figured it was not working. Not sure if it was not working anymore because I got imune against it or because of my hormones.... I take the progesterone cream but now am going lower on it as my estrogen has gone down. I have been given HRT Patch (combi) to see if that would help, but I am a smoker (yes I know I know...) so am a bit hesistant also. The questions I have really is, what did you find helped you best? Did HRT (and here the questions is HRT advised in the perimenopausal stage or is it just delaying the whole process again? Is one meant to wait till menopausal and then start HRT?) help you also mentally? What experiences do you have with antidepressants? Do you find it helps? So far I take vitamins etc, this is: Fish oil (actually a lot, 1620 EPA, 1080 DH (9 capsules, but I find it helps with the brain fog!), Vitamin B6 (240 mg), Vitamin E (500 IU), Vitamin B12 and l tryptophan (1000 mg at night (sleep good), and 500 mg 2x over the day.

amy602,2017-06-14T22:02+00:00,Cramping tingling etc in perimenopause,I was wondering has anyone had any feelings of numbness and tingling (like when a part of your body falls asleep) during perimenopause? I know that cramping is a part of it but was wondering about the other. I used to get really bad cramps in my calf when I first started with Peri (which was just shy of a year ago) back then I would also get the tingling and numbness feeling in part of my leg and foot After a like 2 months that went away and I would have very mild cramps in my calf every now and then. Now today for the 1st time in about 8 months I got a stronger cramp feeling in my calf along with the numbness and tingling mostly in my foot and then my foot would feel cold. It lasted for a little while then almost went away and then would come back slightly etc. Now about 2 hours later of this starting I have a little tingles and foot is still cold. Was wondering if this is something anyone else has also had. Thanks.

She said this is sometimes normal during perimenopause because of the hormones. But I've been having really bad low back burning pain , I don't know if it's from my stomach gastritis or could it be from the enlarged uterus. The burning radiates to butt and legs..so so irritating. Have anyone ever experience this? The pain pill doesn't seem to help but when the dr. Gave me the anxiety pill it seem to help alot. It burns more if I sit , lying down seem to decrease the burning pain. Could this be part of perimenopause or what?"

liz54943,2014-04-09T13:19+00:00,"Is this peri menopause, rather than just anxiety and depression?","Hello - I feel like I have just had a revelation! I am nearly 44 and I have a long history of PMS, and I suffered with PND when my first child was born. When I tried the Mirena coil I endured permanant PMS for 10 months until I had it removed. So it's safe to say that my hormones have always been very troublesome. For the last year I have noticed that my cycle is slightly shorter and my periods are much lighter. I no longer have the painful cramps, or aching boobs. But, I have also noticed that I am sweatier than before, and my normal deodrant can't seem to cope. The emotional symptoms of my PMS have also changed. I no longer get The Rage which stopped the second my period arraived. But instead I feel very low and hopeless, feelings which start a week before my period and continue right through it, and for a day or two afterwards. Some months I only really get 7-10 'good days' culminating in my feeling very relaxed and happy round about the time of ovulation, then it all quickly slides downhill. My 'good' and 'bad' days seemed to be getting more extreme. Then suddenly, out of the blue last Autumn I started to suffer with anxiety. It got bad quite quickly and I couldn't cope. My GP put me on anti depressants and beta blockers, and informed me I was anxious because I'd had a stressful year (which I had). 3 months on, and the anti depressants only seem to 'work' for about 10 days a month. The rest of the time I feel anxious, and very low and it's a struggle to get through the day. The anxiety is horrible, it's ruining my life and there's simply no rational reason for it. But today, which is Day 12 of my cycle I feel relaxed and perfectly normal - and I can tell I am ovulating. Am I right in thinking the only reason I feel okay and good for only 10 days a month is because my oestrogen levels are increasing? On the days I actually ovulate I feel incredibly chilled out and at peace. On all the other 'bad days' I feel anything from mildly depressed to full blown panic. It's horrible. I can't take any pleasure in anything. Do these symptoms sound familiar to anyone? There's simply NO REASON for me feeling so anxious, and with this sense of impending dread & doom in my stomach. I have little interest in sex, and several times have experienced random insomnia, and also hot flashes where my skin feels white hot on my chest and throat. I don't want to take anti-depressants and beta blokcers when what my body really needs is a bucket full of oestrogen."

Im only 31 but having a lot of different symptoms. At first I thought it was peri at an early age but now Im reading on different sites that it could be PMS or even PMDD. Im having a lot of anxiety that I feel is getting worse as the days lead up to my period. Im feeling depressed and have lower back pain and pain in my joints. My sleep is seriously disrupted. I slept a lot last night but kept waking up throughput the night and now tonight I fell asleep close to 10 and right now its a little after 1 a.m and cant go back to sleep. I feel as if I dont want to be alone anymore and bug the heck out of my husband and kids. I hate driving in traffic or long distances. If this is peri, I absolutely hate it and cant imagine how women deal with this on a daily basis for years and years at a time. I think at times I'm dying and its scary. Anyone else feel the same way. Please explain."

amy602,2017-05-31T12:38+00:00,Question about some perimenopause symptoms,"Hey there,   So I have been in peri since about July 2016, I was put on birth control back in Dec 2016 to help with my sadness, crying, etc.  Each month I got a little better and after a little over 3 months I was 95 % back to my normal self.  I would have sadness issues here and there but nothing major, and nothing that I couldnt handle. The sadness feeling wouldnt happen that often, and wouldnt be as strong. So now, heres my ?'s:  I have missed my last 2 ""periods"" (April&May) and no im not pregnant, I felt 98 % normal during this time, well now the past 3-4 days I had a little more sadness than normal, and had a crying episode on monday (neither were as bad as in the past) I figured that my body maybe ""backed up"" lol so thats why I had the crying issue. The past 2 mornings from when I get up till about an hour and half after im at work my sadness goes back and forth and some times a little stronger.  I was wondering if anyone felt this way, or why I feel this way.  Im thinking that it just my hormones getting out of balance again.  Any thoughts etc?  Thanks so much and Im so sorry if this post is confusing.."

Im 19 mths in Meno, on sertraline for anxiety,evorel conti hrt patch 25mg and betablockers for anxiety attacks/palpitations. I think any one of these can cause water retention?! I have put on well over a stone and am starting to lose it through diet, but my weight/look changes drastically in a day! I get up and look and feel quite slim but within a short while the saddlebags above my hips have appeared and bloated stomach. I wonder if any of these drugs affect kidney function? I have decided to stop the hrt to see if that helps, but need to stay on the other things a few more months at least. I feel so much better in myself but its now the terrible skin (cystic acne) and bulges thats affecting my confidence. Also starting to get health anxiety back a little in case its something else!! Ive had loads of ecgs so it shouldnt be my heart, which ive read can cause this. I know i should go to docs but ive had so much testing over past 2 years for what i think is all meno related issues (cause nothings shown up apart from hormone tests show im in Meno) that it sent my anxiety through the roof, so i try to avoid the doctors! So, does anyone have this water retention problem on HRT/antidepressants such as sertraline or betablockers. Last 2 years ive been tested for stomach problems due to increased gas/burping to rule out sinister causes, i still have it and theres a chance that the gas and water retention could be down to a food intolerance, so ive read, so im cutting out wheat and dairy and sugar for a week to see if that helps! I seem to react to almost everything though, but especially sugar which ive already cut down on, bread which i rarely eat, potatoes which ive stopped having, bananas which i love but will stop. So its going to be a lean protein/salad/fruit diet which ive already started a week ago but only just stopping wheat and dairy today. I may have to see a nutritionist if i cant fathom it. Ive been caffeine free for 8 months and dont drink alcohol. Any idea appreciated ladies xx"

I struggle with various symptoms that we all know really well, and to add to the turmoil, I strongly do not feel well around friends and in the workplace. Now I am the oldest (55) in the team where my co-workers are between 25 to 35. There are some colleagues of the same age as me in other teams. With some ""young"" I work for several years, and I have never felt to be old, weird, etc. Nothing serious happened, and I think it is only my attitude, but I feel that I no longer fit in. Of course, I am older but I am open-minded, quick learner, like new technology etc., but that feeling... like in kind of social limbo, not young not old, with a lot of experience that is more of a burden and not a help... I love my job and do not want to quit (and I think it is mistake that some ladies I know did), but everyday seems to be a mental/social struggle for me. I always ask who I am, what is my role in this team, how I should cope with people around me, especially when I am no longer a naive girl and I have dealt also with unpleasant experiences. Sorry for ramblings, today is not a good day."

At the beginning of December I noticed my shoulders began to ache.  I assumed it was stress due to the upcoming holidays.  Some days were worse than others but most mornings I could hardly move when getting out of bed.  I went to the doctor who referred me to an orthopedic doctor.

Never a good day since August. I just had more bloodwork drawn, thinking maybe something will finally show up. I started bio creams and oral compounded progesterone, and had my thyroid meds changed to a natural version. A week after starting the bios my left foot started burning so bad. Five weeks later my thyroid TSH levels went up to a 23! So back on synthroid and trying to get my levels down. Still have the burning foot and painful left leg, some days worse than others. Constant pain in my upper back and shoulders, adrenaline rushes, shakes, and never ending feeling like I've got an awful flu, which is the worse symptom by far. Lots of other things but those are at the top of the list right now. I had such high hope for the bios, and now I'm thinking that it's not hormones and I've got some bad disease again. Last week I couldn't stop shaking, then awful flu feelings for a few days, and then bam, get my period, or kind of a period, just light, brown stuff. I only ever get about 3 days a month where I'm not completely debilitated. I mean, can perimeno really, really, be this bad? Or do I keep going to different doctors to find out what's wrong with me?

looloo43,2017-05-27T11:58+00:00,"why is hysterectomy such a ""major"" op?","I went into hosp this week for endometrial ablation due to 2+years of heavy erratic & prolonged bleeding with no cycle whatsoever, & a thickened womb lining of 11mm. (I am peri menopausal by the way aged 46). They attempted the ablation 3 times but apparently i have a smaller than normal womb & because it is only 2cm across the ablation procedure failed as the novasure equipment requires the womb to be a minimum of 2.5cm across.  my gynae consultant is going to get another consultant to have another go in day care in the coming weeks, but she said if this proves unsuccessful too, other options may be to try the mirena coil or a hysterctomy. i tried the mirena 10yrs ago when my gp recommended it for contraception but i had to have it removed as it caused very low moods & pelvic pain. i dont know if this was because my womb is small & retroverted (tilted) plus i have never had children. so i am reluctant to try the mirena again. which leads me to think about a hysterctomy.... i had always been led to think this is a major op, but when one of the nurses in hosp this week told me the size of your uterus, it made me wonder why such a small organ removal would be classed as such a big operation - can anyone shed any light, explain ?  many thanks for any replies. x"

Lara66,2017-05-30T10:54+00:00,Nearly 51 - nearly over it (I think!),"Hi ladies. It's been a while since I've been on here but just thought I'd post an update and hope it's useful for some of you. I remember being in my mid\late 40s and thinking the strange symptoms would never end but here I am at nearly 51 and I think I am over the hump. I'm not completely over it but I think I'm descending the other side of the mountain! Apart from taking some natural remedies over the past few years, I've stayed away from HRT for my own reasons. I'm glad I have because I am now able to look back and see the stages of peri quite clearly and how it has affected me. I've had to take Lanzoprazole for constant heartburn but that's the only medication I've taken. Heartburn and IBS are common in peri, apparently due to hormones being located around the gut area. I haven't given up alcohol - I love wine - but I do eat healthily and have plenty of early nights. I remember my first symptom in my late thirties - sex became uncomfortable because, overnight, my vagina felt like sandpaper. That's the only way I can describe it. That continued for about five years, and sometimes is still uncomfortable, but it is easier than it was. My periods became irregular a few years ago and my body temperature increased with manageable hot flushes for a few years. Then, about 2 months before my 50th birthday, the hot flushes came thick and fast and it was unbearable, I had to take something for it. Someone had recommended Black Cohosh which I found helped for a while but after a few months, I found I was developing a resistance to it so had to stop for a few weeks. I went back on it and was good again for a while. Then at the end of last year, I had a 3 month break from periods and I felt like it was glimpse into what life is going to be like for me one day and how I'm going to feel. I felt great. No moods, no cramps, less heartburn; a few sweats every day but I could cope. I just generally felt lighter and content. I thought that was it. I thought I would soon find I hadn't had a period for a year (I keep track on my calendar) and so would officially be in menopause. But, alas, I came on just before Xmas last year and have had several periods at irregular intervals but no hot flushes. I felt like I did before peri, apart from my periods being so irregular. Then I stopped bleeding a few weeks ago and I feel like I'm not going to have a period for a while. My sex drive is low, I'm hot and having flushes again.  I do still have to take the heartburn medication a few times a week but I feel like that has improved generally. Like some of you on here, health anxiety has been a big problem for a number of years, but it has subsided in recent months.  Around 45, I started googling everything, backwards and forwards to the doctors for a few years, until I went to the doctors last year and saw someone I hadn't seen before. She was in her 60s and I felt like I was talking to an aunt, or an old friend. Just lovely. After checking my boobs and telling me she couldn't find any lumps (the reason for the appointment) she looked at my records and saw my long list of doctors appointments and asked me why I'd had so many. I explained that I was worried about dying early, leaving my kids motherless etc. and the tears started flowing! Without being condescending or patronising, she suggested I was suffering from health anxiety and said it's a normal thing to go through at my age. But, she said, 'if you're not careful, it'll rob you of everything that's important', which I've never forgotten. She directed me to a leaflet on the subject on this very website. It has helped, although I think it's easier said than done when a woman's body is going through such changes. So that's where I'm at. Hoping this time without a period is a long time, so that I'll know a whole year without is not far away!"

jannie9770,2016-10-20T21:26+00:00,peri menopause and Cyclo-Progynova 2mg HRT,"Hi ladies, I've been feeling pretty low and all of a sudden became very anxious. I've noticed a change in myself over the past few years and am convinced it's not all down to anxiety and depression as the Dr says but rather a hormonal imbalance due to the peri menopause, I am 45. In desperation I asked the Dr to prescribe HRT which she did do as although on sertraline and the mini pill cereals it doesn't seem to be doing the trick at all during certain times in the month. I'm looking at the research of cyclo-progynova (HRT prescribed) and there appears to be no reviews of this particular brand which is making me more anxious! I just don't know what to do for the best but don't want to feel like this anymore. Please can you tell me if you have taken this HRT and if so how are/ did you get on with it? Or can you let me know if HRT helped or hindered you? Any advice would be much appreciated - feeling lost as to what to do for the best. I've always suffered with terrible PMS and am afraid of the side effects of HRT will start this again. Please help!!! 😳"

bumblebee85,2017-04-21T20:56+00:00,Anxiety like a parasite,"I had a hysterectomy with all taken except part of an ovary, and have suffered with hypothyroidism for 20+ years. Because of this I missed all of the little signs of peri-menopause. So everything took me by surprise. At a guess I am around 10 months post. YIPPEE! Looking back I do not recognise the raving lunatic I was for the best part of 9 months early last year. I think now the anxiety fuelled and fed my symptoms like a parasite draining me of who I was. Once I had finished being tested and probed being investigated for every horrible disease I thought I had and finally accepted it was hormones and menopause I realised I needed some help, I am not sure whether it made a difference but I was also dealing with the sudden passing of my beloved husband aged just 52 so maybe I was a bit more vulnerable. So I started seeing a counsellor, it didn’t rid of my symptoms but helped me cope better with them, so the anxiety gradually eased followed by the rest of the hideous hormone related mess. The symptoms I remember are as follows as far as I can recall. No appetite – Eat nothing for weeks on end, just sipped water and ice chips. Weight loss- lost nearly 2 stone Nausea- constant day & night Belching- awful indigestion despite not eating Insomnia- totally unable to fall or stay asleep got maybe 3 hours a night if lucky Night sweats- OMG drenched need I say more Heat Intolerance- This was weird I felt warm all the time normally cold because of my thyroid, couldn’t bear even a warm shower it had to be cold, the hair-dryer was an absolute no no. Flushes- Lasted forever just finish one then start another, either with or without the sweats. No triggers only very sensitive to temperature to surroundings Difficulty Swallowing/Eating- Like a lump stuck in throat even taking meds was hard because of gagging but was only actually sick a couple of times Tiredness/Exhaustion- probably mainly due to lack of sleep Emotional/Depressive- moods were down and very weepy. If I didn’t have such wonderful kids not sure I would bothered trying probably just ended it all ( hate to admit that now) Confusion/difficulty focusing- very light headed and dazed feeling IBS like symptoms- obsessed with keeping diary of BM Palpitations- happened a lot Chest tightness- very uncomfortable of course I had angina and heart disease, this was definitely anxiety Pounding heart – I could feel my heart pounding in my chest and hear it in my ears tremors/shakes- Shaking externally and internally. The external was like a constant shiver, internal was like an inner bouncing very hard to explain restlessness- couldn’t relax or sit still anxiety- WOW never been an anxious person but this was just awful I was googling every little symptom, this made every other symptom worse and lots of crossover symptoms of anxiety itself. Panic Attacks- Again never had one before very scary, got so I was afraid to go out, talk to anyone or make or receive calls tachycardia (100-140)- due to anxiety headaches- terrible pounding head zaps- would happen day and night like a shock in head feeling something wrong- convinced I had something terminal, Feeling detached from reality Dry mouth-couldn’t quench thirst no matter how much I drank. I think the worst symptoms were around the time of M day then after each 3 month intervals things gradually improved. Just like a thunderstorm coming you hear it coming there is a frenzy then gradually it fades and settles like ripples in the water the further away you go the calmer it is. Now I am me again in the words of Lewis Carroll “ I can't go back to yesterday, because I was a different person then”. Hope this helps someone."

karen60759,2017-05-24T09:28+00:00,"Thinking of going on the combined contraceptive pill to help peri menopause symptoms, any advice?","Hi - I have come to the conclusion that ovulation seems to be an issue for me, as times in my life when I wasn't ovulating, i.e. when I was pregnant and breast feeding were the only times in recent years where I didn't expereince this horrible emotional roller coaster each month. I literally have 1 good week post period, a bad week mid cycle, another bad week pre period and then relief during my period - and it has just been getting more intense in the past 18 months. I've tried antidepressants - which I think help me on my good weeks - because I feel great, but don't seem to be able to prevent the down weeks, am now I'm also on bio identiical oestrogen gel, which worked great initially - for the first 5 months but I think my cycle has now synced to the increased oestrogen levels which is why it appears to have stopped working. I had assumed that the oestrogen gel would have stopped ovulation as it's at quite a high does (3 pumps per day) but I now read that this is not necessaril the case, ( I still have symptoms of ovulation)  as it is no where near as high as the OC pill. So I think the pill might be the best option for me as it would completely override my cycle and stop ovulation - as I've read it can help some women. I would really like to hear if it has helped anyone else and which pill worked best! Thanks."

Ive been having Peri menopause syptoms for about 4 years now, but due to having chronic ilness i just brushed it off as another part of my ilnesss. Im 48 so i guess i should have realised.  There have been many weird things happening.. one was a really weird taste in my mouth and unable to eat or drink certain things without them tasting foul.  That started at the beginging of last year. Fast forward toseptempber of last year and my periods stopped for 4 months and i started having really bad menopause symptoms. Hot flushes, heart pounding, night sweats etc.  my periods started up again though they are now all over the placebut ive ive also noticed that i have developed an allergy to sugar. If i eat or drink anything with alot of sugar in it within 10 mins my sinuses swell up then i get a terrible headache that no painkiller will touch. about 80% of the time an antihistamine will help and the headace does calm down. I did think it was odd and related to my other ilness , but on research i find that it common in menopause as the lack of eastrogen effects your bodies ability to handle sugar and processed carbs.   Anyone else with similar issues?"

Just saying this gives me relief already, knowing that there is an online community I can run to and discuss my health issues esp menopause without being thought of as going crazy or over-reacting. I had my partial laparascopic hysterectomy May of 2016.  I had my uterus taken out but the ovaries remain and my OB told me that this will put me in menopause right away and it did the following month.  But boy, the effects are sooo severe I thought I was going to die many times.  The palpitations were out of this world I needed to run to sit every time I felt it coming.  Many times I needed help taking showers due to unexplained weakness and very shaky legs. My youngest is going crazy already because I couldnt seem to know if I'm feeling hot or cold! LOL! I developed panic attacks too and anxiety so much so that I stopped stepping out of the house for fear of having attacks and dying outside the house.  I stopped doing fun things with my family due to constant aches and pains and weakness.  This breaks my heart because I want to enjoy the company of my husband and kids. I turned to prayers and meditation and deep breathing.  Somehow these help me relax and focus my attention to other issues but Im still not my old self.  My productivity has greatly diminished.  The back pain is still here and so is chronic fatigue. I've seen a lot of doctors already.  At present, Im taking the all natural pills Estro Vive, icing my back and joints most of the day and doing a little bit of stretching.  My anxiety has improved greatly and I am breathing easily now compared to before.  Despite the improvements though, my family is impatient to see me being my old self again.  I am thankful that I found this site and read your stories.  It's very reassuring that I am not alone feeling this horrible.  Those of you who've been through this stage and who are now feeling ok give me hope that life will be better too one day for me and the millions of women out there who are also suffering.  Please continue to share your progress so we can all help and support each other. Forever thankful..."

Had all the blood work estrogen was very low thus obviously was treated with ant-depressant & it resolved itself quite simply. Then a month later I had bleeding I thought maybe it was still perimenopause. This happened about 6-7 times over the past 12 months. I was shocked cuz I did believe I was in menopause as did my doc. Now my moods, anxiety, irritability is back just the same as I suffered when I had pmdd I was told the bleeding is a red flag plus the bleeding which I am now being told can be all sorts of things but scariest uterus cancer I have bad ins so put off going to doc finally did & she got pretty serious and insisted I have a endometrial biopsy right there that day. She also prescribed a estrogen patch. I am just terrified. I have no idea what is going on with my body & didn't think that the bleeding was anything other than still being in perimenopause I am just guilt ridden I did not seek medical care sooner. I thought maybe if you weren't in full blown menopause you could still have episodes of bleeding but now the mood stuff has increased I feel like I am a nut case then every time after I feel that for s couple days the bleeding starts right after. I am totally baffled and feel stupid that I did not realize bleeding after menopause can be indication of something serious. Has anyone else had anything similar. Can bleeding start back up after no period of bleeding for at least 12 months. Will the Stephen help with the moos stuff I am scared and confused"

Sleep, etc. I had more more blood work done weeks later by my chiropractor and he told me this week that my hormones are out of whack especially my testosterone with my red blood cells being low. (Last week my PCP said I had low iron saturation , not rbc.) The herbalist where I bought the progesterone cream from said that this is white normal.gor the hormones to be out of whack when first starting the cream ,they are trying to balance themselves. Does anyone know this to be true? Im meeting with my chiropractor today for consultation, he will be putting me on supplements. He did ask had anyone ever told me that my testosterone was very high? I said yes I was treated for PCOS in the past. Could this be the reason or the progesterone cresm?"

Still working up to 150 mg. Not feeling much difference yet. The only thing that gets me thru is Ativan (.5 in morning and night ). And a bit of wine. Doing cognitive therapy and mindfulnes, as well. Moods are erratic....change on a dime. And I am feeling depressed over issues that I was able to control previously. Is this normal ??"

julie89512,2017-05-06T08:52+00:00,Advice needed r,"Hi.  Im 56 had a total hysterectomy at 42 iv been on tiberlone 2.5mg since with no problem, but yesterday at a Gp aptment she asked why I was on tiberlone not estrogen only one.  I was put on that one because I was told estrogen would feed the remaining endometriosis that they couldn't get at.  I was worried that if I start taking the new tablet that I might get the endometriosis back, I spoke to her on the phone and she said after 15 years it will have gone. ??? I'm also on Antidepressants for health Anxiety after having a rough year with health issues.  So any advice please would be grateful, anyone out there had a total hysterectomy with having Endometriosis  and put oestrogen only after many years after the operation.  She has put me on a low dose 0.3mg 1 a day of PREMARIN  and will all of the Endometriosis have gone after 15 years,  Kind Regards"

I'm 52, going through the perimenopause and just recently had to start taking contraception and beacuse of my age, it had to be the mini pill (Cerazette).  The main symptoms of my perimenopause that are affecting me badly are the tireddness and anxiety.  I already take anti-depreesants but would liek to eventaully come off them (have had episodes of depression since my thirties) but anxiety just appeared with the peri.  I did lots of research online and found a recommendation by Prof John Studd to try bioidentical hormones as follows: Oestrogel daily along with Utrogestan for the first 7 days each month (to protect the womb I believe). I took the article in to my doctor and she has prescribed oestroegel for 7 days each month and says the progesterin of the mini pill will provide the progesterone.  Has she got it wrong?  I've read elsewhere that the mini pill does NOT provide enough progesterone to protect the womb while take oestrogen.   Another alarm bell went off when I went to collect the prescription (oestrodose) and the pharmacist said that one is hardly ever prescribed!  Or should I just trust that the doc knows what she's talking about?! Any help will be much appreciated  :-)"

I feel weak and my legs feel swollen suddenly, severe pressure in upper abdomen starts and i have to lay down because something is going on with my head. 2 years ago the symptom progressed to the point of palpitations during a hot shower and weakness but it stayed onlty for about 2 months and went away. But the weakness outside persists till  today. Is my brain cutting circulation to my other organs in situations of heat? Zhave anyone of you had anything similar. Because of this I already moved from Florida to PA, because it was hot there all the time. But here in PA as soon as the temp hit 80 degrees I am in trouble again."

I would like to share my pesonal experience, I was told  by my Doctor to try and wean myself off them as I had hit that crucial stahe of 5 years where they do not recommend that you take them any further! I did what they asked and for three months I reduced to half per day, recommended rather than one every other day, I have to admit I managed well, didn't really have a huge impact, so I thought I would try half every other day to reduce it further, within a week, my symptoms came back with a vengeance, I felt generally unwell, my bones hurt, headaches, mood swings and panic, it was horrific, so on that basis I spoke to my Gp and I have restarted my Livial, one per day, to say that these tablets change my life is an understatement, for me personally the beefits far outway the supposed risks, I am happy I will take them for many years to come as long as you are checked I really don't see why you should suffer if you don't have to? Good Luck to you all and I hope that this post will at least make you feel a bit more relaxed. My Gp said that some women can manage after 5 years of HRT but some need it up until ten years depending on the severity of your symptoms, All Gp's are different, I think they just have to stand on the side of caution as with any drugs, For me, no-one knows my body like me, and if it makes me feel well and able to function normally then I am all for it, Tibolone for me has been a lifesaver and long may it be prescribed for us Girls."

supemack39,2017-04-17T09:27+00:00,It takes a while......but things do settle down!,"I,d like to let all the ladies with all the horrible, scary menopause symptoms know that although it takes time, you can overcome this and beat it. A few months ago, I was at the end of my rope, having been messed about by various doctors, experimenting with dosages and types of hrt.I was suicidal and offered ad,s, sleeping tablets, beta blockers etc. I didn't go down that route. I discovered magnesium which, because I had a major issue swallowing anything bigger than the hrt tablet, I took in the form of cell salts. These little tabs. settled my system down and I added Kali phos, for nerves. These are natural salts, and non addictive, just something your body is low on. So after the head doctor took over my care and put me back on the hrt I had been on and which I was taken off due to my age, 60, he then put me back on to the original hrt. However, the 1mg of estrogen was too low, and it was changed to 2mg. This was the sequi version, which kick started my period, but things generally settled down considerably. So, although I Have worked through and had to put up with a fairly uncomfortable few months, I now feel pretty normal. My regime is now the hrt conti 2mg estrogen and 1mg progesterone, vitamin b12 complex, vitamin d, cell salts, mag phos and kali phos in the morning, and magnesium night spray at bedtime, I now sleep for about 6 hours (at one point I did not sleep at all!) and can even go back to sleep for a couple of hours after waking. I don't have hot flushes, the panic attacks have gone, the anxiety has calmed down, the dry , burning mouth is soon much better, the reflux has cleared, the dry nose is much better and I can once again cope with every day life. I get the occasional shakes still, but that is settling down too. I have more good days and can even contemplate booking our annual holiday, when we drive to France and rent a gite. I couldn't have even thought about this before. I have been on distance trips for work and have done a presentation with no problems,. So for all you ladies who have been struggling, hang in there as you too, can overcome the menopause horrors. My doctor finally did hormone checks a couple of weeks ago, and acknowledged that I had been right and that the low hormones were to blame for all of my symptoms and I had been right not to take all the meds prescribed because I would now be dependant on them. As it is, he actually said that I could probably do with an even higher dose of hormones and as that is not possible, he is quite happy for me to stay on my current regime as it is so obviously helped. I hope this long message can help some of you, I know we are all different and one size does not fit all, but stand by your guns, as we have got to be heard. Best wishes to all who are still in ""the dark place""."

Had to stop due to fibroids. Anxiety was bad but i put it down to losing Mum but perhaps its peri? Is it just me going crazy? 😦
julia15874,2017-04-25T08:04+00:00,I'm a newcomer with hairs on my palms 😁,"Hi my name is Julia, only a joke about the hairy palms, however this four year journey so far makes me look now and then. Four years ago I had a hysterectomy due to large fibroids, with only one ovary remaining, the first year was amazing, no periods, felt the best I had in years, then the symptoms started, mainly dizziness to start with, went to see GP, I thought I bet the Menopause is starting, it's so easy when you have had a hysterectomy to blame any symptom on it, anyway the blood test said I wasn't peri menapause, but my red blood cells were at a high level, two years of testing my blood as they thought I had a condition called Polycythemia, my symptoms became worse, I had days I couldn't function for dizziness and painful hands and feet, exercise was the hardest, I was so fatigued, just getting out of bed was an effort and now I get really bad travel sickness and the anxiety is terrible! All this time it's Polycythemia Vera only because my blood didn't show peri menopause and the symptoms fitted Polycythemia Vera as I wasn't classical hot flushing etc....decided to get a second opinion on my blood last week, he told me on no certain terms I had polycythemia, he gave me a blood test and hay ho I'm peri menopausal!!! Not just that for four years I've not been able to have HRT due to them thinking I've got Polycythemia Vera because Polycythemia makes you have thick blood, HRT there's a risk of blood clots so I was left to suffer with symptoms and I was getting more and more depressed, I am now going to get on HRT, making an appointment today, now does anyone else have a journey like mine, do u have fatigue, painful joints, fatigue, high red blood count erthrocytosis and dizziness? After a hysterectomy and how have you got on with HRT?"
lmceachern,2017-04-23T00:11+00:00,Perimenopause bleeding and clotting,"I am almost 54 years old. I had normal periods up until the last 2 years. I started having light periods, which I really didnt have a problem with.  I then went over 4 months without a period, but had intermitent spotting.  I didn't think anything of this. I kept reading it was normal.  I am very healhty. I use alternative meds.  I was feeling fine about this til about 3 weeks ago. I stepped out of my jeep and a gush occurred, and I ran to the bathroom. The next day the same thing happened. Then the bleeding got really heavy followed by clotting.  I have been doing this on and off for 3 weeks. I really thought I was getting close to being done, now this.  I am in NO pain, except for light tummy cramps. I use lavender essential oil for it.   I am taking natural progesterone and red raspberry and some other hormone herbal supplements.  I was curious if anyone is experiencing these symptoms and what you are doing about it?  Thanks!"

Guest,2017-03-23T16:44+00:00,"I'm a mess, need advice!","I just don't know how to deal with this anymore. I've been a total mess since last year. So many severe peri symptoms I just can't take it anymore. I only have 5 or 6 good days during ovulation. The rest I'm sick, shaky, sore and can't breathe. I can't take NSAID's because of gastritis. Last night I woke up at 3 AM with a very bad headache, shaky, and feeling hot in my cheeks. I took Tylenol and then had severe nausea for the next 4 hours! I can't seem to even tolerate tylenol anymore and now have anxiety about it hurting my liver. My right shoulder is frozen and left is starting to head that way too, I couldn't even get my nightgown off this moring. All I could do was stand in the shower and cry. I'm seeing the GYN on Mondays, do I ask her to put me on HRT? Are bioidenticals the best? I'm terrified of side effects of orals. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on feeling like total death.  I take multivitamins, ferrochel iron, cal-magnesium, synthroid. Have seen every doc and had every test imaginable and almost certain it's hormones causing all the havoc. Trying soy milk in smoothies. Bought Menopace, but unsure of all the soy. Please, please, I need any advice to get through this living hell."

Guest,2017-04-21T02:59+00:00,Getting help with weight,"I have gained to the point that I rotate three pairs of jeans with elastic waistbands as the core of my wardrobe.  One of my nephews told me that I have a double chin and the other has expressed concern about how much sugar I eat.  I never had weight problems until peri.  I just eat all the time.  I never actually get hungry because I eat all day.  It's all comfort eating, feeling like having what I want gives me control over something in my chaotic life.  I have Crohn's disease, too, and have a checkup next month with my GI doctor, who is going to have a fit when he sees me like this.  Unlike my gyn doctor, he actually thinks that maintaining a healthy weight is important.  She doesn't seem to care.  I have to get help for myself.  Please tell me it's not impossible to lose some weight if I get on a healthy food and exercise plan while in peri.  Has anybody done this?"
Guest,2017-04-18T18:31+00:00,CA-125 NOT always cancer!,"What conditions other than ovarian cancer can cause increased CA 125 results? A number of benign conditions can cause elevations of the CA 125 level, including pregnancy, endometriosis, uterine fibroids (benign tumors), pancreatitis, normal menstruation, pelvic inflammatory disease, and cirrhosis of the liver. Benign tumors or cysts of the ovaries can also cause an abnormal test result. Increases can also be seen in cancers other than ovarian cancer, including malignancies of the uterine tubes, endometrium, lung, breast, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract as well as lymphoma. Is CA 125 testing useful as a cancer screening test? Although CA 125 is a useful test in monitoring women who are being treated for ovarian cancer, a single CA 125 test is not considered to be a useful screening test for cancer. Some women with ovarian cancer (up to 20%) never have elevated CA 125 levels, while most women who do have elevated CA 125 levels do not have cancer. In fact, because the results of CA 125 testing can be elevated in so many noncancerous conditions, only about 3% of women with elevated CA 125 levels have ovarian cancer."

Dizzy felt in fog. Tremors. Hot sweats. Freezing during day. Tingling hands and feet and nose and lips. All sorts of weird symptoms. High blood pressure. Palpitations. High heart rate. They worked me up for all sorts of things. All negative. In these past few months starting January my period was late and short for January and February and I have not gotten one since February 28. My hormone levels say peri menopause. On and off I've had some symptoms mostly anxious and palpitations and dizzy. Nothing like I had during that rage. I know I hear complaints if symptoms but can a rage like that happen? Thanks. I'm really feeling a lot better now more like myself I'm sure it's gonna wax and wane.

And then I got it again February 28 which seemed like a normal one for me. I thought the change was from being sick. But now I haven't gotten it since February 28 and no sign of it either. I did do a home pregnancy test which is negative. I have an OB appointment Thursday which I'm sure I will get a work up for it. But I have had symptoms that they weren't sure what was going on. I had other things going on to so not sure if this has caused the other problems or what. But I feel like I am blowing up like a balloon ! I am heavy but just the past 2 years or so my weight ha stained around my belly I never had this usually it's hip and butt and legs. But now my belly feels so bloated like I am going to busy. I almost feel a little nauseated and belch to help relieve it. Is this normal!?

I have had symptoms that can be a few different things. One being peri menopause. I've had hot flashes, freezing spells, severe dizzy, feel faint, nausea, headaches, shaky tremors, feel jittery,anxiety, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, and high blood pressure and palpitations. I have had every medical test known and they are negative. I am gonna see a rheumatologist as fibromyalgia and mast cell disease and POTS are possibilities also. I have had spells of anxiety but I never had anxiety before I feel it's related to whatever is going on with me. I did have hormones drawn and my OB said they show pre menopause. About 3 years ago I noticed my hair developed permanent waves which I'm sure we're from hormones but my hair has gotten super thin and does not grow at all and hasn't in few years and I never cut it. Anyhow in January when all this started my period was late and extremely short ( usually it last one and half weeks to two I have copper IUD). Then in February it was early and last like 1-2 days. Then I got it again February 28. And it last one half weeks so I thought things were getting normal. I was thinking this stuff I've been having messed me up. Well now I have not gotten it again since February 28 and I do not feel like I am getting it. I have been regular my whole life except one summer either last or year before I can't remember I was late in August then got it and then got it again two weeks after that but that was the only time. I will have to call my OB this week if it doesn't show up but just curious if things can change this fast and at 44. Thanks."

I've no idea what is happening to me, I kind of want it to be the menopause because if it isn't then I'm scared at what's wrong. I'm nearly 51. No children, wonderful husband and a happy home. Until recently I've been well, always slightly overweight but exercise well and eat quite healthily. In august last year i had a muscle problem in my back. Docs over and over, medication only. Visited in October to explain back still bad and periods erratic but a permanent bloating feeling. Sent away with advise of tablets and chiropractor for back. Here we are now in Feb, my back is still bad although I found a great osteopath who is helping. However I've now developed sore aching arms which is non stop (3 weeks), I'm tearful, my face feels puffy and tingling, I have nausea, light headed, period two weeks late after having them every fortnight, I'm anxious, I can't sleep or concentrate, had a really swollen gland in my neck for 5 days which has just gone down. I ache all over and I'm fed up feeling so sad. I saw a different doc on Wednesday and she was lovely. Cried my eyes out though :-( I'm due blood tests next week and she's checking for all sorts but says will be around 2 weeks for results. I need to stop myself from googling the symptoms as I'm scaring myself silly but after reading some of your tales most of what I have could be the menopause. I think it's the aching non stop of my arms and the bloating and the new one of the puffy tingling cheeks which is worrying me most. If you'd have asked me a few months ago if I'd be this person I now seem to be I wouldn't have believed you. I've never felt so scared and desperate. Thank you for reading x"

I too had my periods right up until last year age 55 - well it's only been 4mths since my last period so no idea what been going on. Coz when I started the HRT bang the period came back which was a month ago. So I am yet to see what happens. In regards to being around stressful people! Trying being married to one! My husband is like a walking time bomb! He's always yelling and getting angry about something or the other, and now I am starting to become like that I have such anger issues, irritable and less forgiving of people who have hurt or offended me. Totally different to the kind of person I used to be. so many time I have contemplated taking my own life, but then I would think about my kids, and feel real bad for them like how would they cope with the loss of their mother, they too are having stress issues in their lives. my daughter gets depressed, pregnancy hormones. My son suffered from anxiety and depression he's a young adult but still very dependant on me."

callianne_65675,2017-03-03T17:21+00:00,I'm going to love my fat belly!,"Today, I have decided to love my fat belly! I know!  Tomorrow I will hate it again, but I've thought long and hard about how I could accept it for now and love it. It's a part of me! I have to love it! Or, at least manage it.  I'm going to take Epsom salt or Rock Salt baths, throw in essential oils and RELAX.  Take peppermint oil after a meal.  Wear yoga pants on those bad days where it is huge and with my yoga pants, I will wear high heels, a pretty flowing top and makeup. If I feel like it.  I will buy maternity jeans, as my belly goes up and down they move with it. At least these jeans will fit my butt, as with bigger pants my cute butt is lost!! I will also dress in pretty flowing blouses when it larger and detract the eye away from this very large (loll) problem area.  My goal will be to walk for 20 or 10 minutes twice daily. If I can't, due to exhaustion, I will read or do something I love.  I will paint my toes nails, or my fingernails and feel pretty all over.  I will cultivate my inner child and try and have fun and do things  I love. I have spent a lifetime caring for others.  I will get a sign to hang on my bedroom door saying 'gone fishing' or 'out to lunch' whatever, to have those times alone, or when I need to rest and sleep.  I will drink warm water and lemon juice upon waking. (It makes you pee!) I will on some days make diuretic smoothies with parsley and all sorts of goodies I like (just add apple juice or fruit juice if you hate the idea. They are quite tasty).  I will say 'no' more often and not feel bad.  I will understand that my belly is just one part of me, I happen to have lovely eyes, I wish I had lovely hair! but I have lovely legs too. I will show these off to the best of my ability.  as Sophia Loren says, beauty is not physical it is how one feels inside.  I will do this one day at a time. If you have any to share please do and GOD BLESS. XX"

I looked up the side effects of Estradiol and I've got myself all panicked now.  It says that weight gain can be a severe side effect and mentioned thinning hair on the scalp. Both of these things are great fears of mine. I've just spent months losing six stone in weight to better myself and I'm worried the Estradiol will go against this. And I can't stand the thought of losing my hair. I don't know what to do now because of this and just wanted to know if any of you here have used this and what it was like for you?

LouiseScotland,2017-03-18T14:50+00:00,Hysteroscopy.,"Hi ladies, a post about having a hysteroscopy, because I thought it may be useful to some of you. Several weeks ago, after brown spotting, I was referred by my GP for a pelvic ultrasound because I am 54 and 2 years post menopausal.  I had a transvaginal ultrasound which was fine and almost relaxing!  It showed a thickened endometrium, which was 6mm...the guidline is that 3 is 'normal', post menopause. I then saw a gynacologist who took a couple of endometrial biopsies, a pretty uncomfortable experience but it only took a couple of minutes, and nothing to be dreaded.  There was a tiny amount of bleeding afterwards and I felt a bit crampy that evening, but really nothing. (The biopsies were actually insufficient to be tested but I only found that out when I went for a scheduled hysteroscopy yesterday.) I had the hysteroscopy yesterday and had been dreading it after googling 'is a hysteroscopy painful?'.  I read that it is a 'barbaric' procedure, that it shouldn't be done without general anaethesia (they ask that you take ibuprofen and paracetamol beforehand) and that some ladies are in pain and in bed for days afterwards.  I went to the hospital with utter dread and was actually hoping - after being late - that they'd send me home!  After a quick paperwork check you remove bottom half clothes, get onto a strangely shaped bed, legs up on rests (how elegant, not!) and a very tiny flexible camera is inserted.  You can see your cervix on a screen, and then follow the journey of the camera. I won't lie, it is very painful, but they tell you how to breathe (just like havng a baby) and you can stop at any time.  I didn't because I figured it would just take longer.  The very worst pain was in my lower back but it was over very quickly.  Afterwards they give you a pad because there will be a little bleeding, particularly as biopsies may be done, (take your own unless you want a giant hospital pad!) and then you get dressed. They made me a cuppa, then I had a chat with the doctor who'd done the procedure. In my case all looked well, and the biopsies and the fluid they use will be sent for testing.  Results will be sent out by letter in 3 - 4 weeks.  It turned out that the actual thickness was 6mm in some places, over 7 in others, and over 27 at the top of the uterus.  Thank goodness I hadn't known that at the time because I would have utterly panicked.  The consultant thinks there's a fibroid at the top but it doesn't require treatment as it will probably get smaller anyway.  She may also recommend a vaginal cream to be used for a while but that will be in the results letter. I was fine afterwards and went shopping and was fine later on in the evening, no discomfort, nothing.  There was a little bleeding yesterday but that's stopped now, so all good.  As long as the biopsy tests are clear, and there's no reason to think they won't, I won't need to be seen at the hospital again.   Click here to view image"

I don't really have any of the textbook physical symptoms but the emotional ones are over the top! Anxiety, depression and basically anything! I have never been depressed nor anxiety until this whole mess started. I did the usual route with doctors. My general practice Dr of course started with antidepressants which turned me into a zombie. Next I was referred to a therapist. She told me my issues were hormonal that I needed to find a dr that could help. No one wanted to help me because I still have a regular period. I found a dr that prescribed progesterone. That helped but seems my body got used to it & was very effective. I have been married 22 years, two great kids 15 & 20. I have a very stable life so there was no reason for the anxiety & depression to just kick in! I am now using a estrogen/ testesterone cream. It was awesome in the beginning but again my body is adjusting to it. So it's just not helping my symptoms. It's been almost 6 years & I feel like I'm just letting my life slip away. I have to fight everyday just to do the normal everyday things. I guess I'm looking for something that worked for other women. I don't want to be on antidepressants! Both my mom & grandmother had full hysterectomy in their 20's. So that leaves me with absolutely no clue what to expect!"

December starts with feeling of lump in throat told reflux.. then the nausea, hot flashes, spacey brain fog feeling, headaches, blurry vision, not sleeping ...started seeing doctors. Because the nausea increased ( now I believe was my anxiety over having cancer) did it but. Because of it I have lost over 20 pounds in 2. 1/2 months.. so needless to say they thought I had cancer.. I have had a cat scan of pretty much my whole body, endoscopy, blood work.. all they found was reflux and a hiatal hernia... I went to mg gyne first and was told she thinks it's gastro problems because menopause causes you to gain weight not lose weight .. so 5000.00 dollars later here I am with a prescription for Prozac and an appt with the gyne next week.. I am so discussed I took a leave from work and am trying to pull myself out of the funk I'm in..

I know that palpitations can be a symptom of perimenoause, but what I read online today seemed to indicate that ""normal"" palpitations last for a few minutes.....of course, once it started today, I became very anxious which probably didn't help.....and I'm due to start my period in the next few days as well which could be a factor. Any words of wisdom? Am I alone in this one?"

I'm 43 and am certain that I'm in perimenopause. I spend most of every month sick - when I ovulate and for an entire week after, the week before my period and most of the week during. My cycle is only 23-24 days now so that doesn't leave many decent days. The palpitations are awful, they really scare me. I've had 3 EKGs in the last few weeks and all were fine.

All this is not me I am usually calm go with the flow person,  I was tested for literally everything under sun and all negative.  Anyhow I had that last about 2 weeks, end result is I am on 2 BP meds now and I still have some issues.  One is night sweats not too severe but I do notice them, I also have this burning feeling even down below,  I just got a culture done and it was negative and so was my urine culture.  During all this I did have my OB check for pre menopause etc, she ran some labs and I dont have the values but was told they showed pre-menopause.  I do notice I am testier than my norm and I do get anxious at times which is all new to me.  Not sure if this burning is a symptom also?  I just say things feel off and my poor husband just doesn't get it!  I also had irregular periods for past two months.  In Jan it was a little late and short, Feb very short (2 days) and end of Feb was back to it's normal lenght one and half to 2 weeks, but they have been changing in flow.  I wasn't sure if the irregularity was due to being sick and on so much meds.  Anyhow I am always tired and seem more so lately, and i have lots of aches and pains all the time, I was told previously years ago mild fibromyalgia and I think it has gotten worse but I havne't been to a dr. for that.  At this point I am just pushing through each day, at times I am not sure I remember what feeling normal is!!!"

trizwizz,2017-03-11T04:14+00:00,Menopause hell,Hello. It's 4.00am here and yet again I can't sleep. Background info. I'm 53 - nearly 54. Last April I had surgery for rectocele - which wasn't overly successful but that's abother story! Two weeks before surgery I had my peruod as usual. I had a regular cycle and no symptoms of menopause at all. The surgery leaves you with a pack in the vagina that is taken out after 24hrs. The minute the pack was removed I had the first hot flush - Wham! - I felt most peculuar and nurses were concerned about infection - it wasn't. And that was it I was plunged into full blown menopause. I would be convinced they pulled my ovaries out at the same time if I didn't know better! I had one period since in August and thats all. Mood swings not too bad - obviously I've always been a complete cow. But these hot flushes have got to the point where I just can't cope. I am loath to take hrt as I already take quite a bit of other meds . I have tried some other alternatives with no success. Sage and shatavari (???)I think. I have about 30 flushes a day. Night sweats which interfere with sleep. I am not the best sleeper in the world anyway and this is not helping. Things are so bad tonight I am considering going to the gp and asking for hrt! I had a blood test about 6mths ago which showed fsh levels of 50%way through menopause. Not in a good state. Sorry for the moan

anon68,2017-03-07T19:54+00:00,"Chickens and eggs - or ""stressed because of peri or peri symptoms because of stress?""","So over the past few months I've lost about 3 kilos and am now technically underweight. Now I know this can cause irregular periods, and the most likely cause of my weight loss is stress, but how likely is it that it's the other way round? (I've had blood tests that have come up clear for anything ""medical"" as the cause of my weight loss and basically got told to eat more.) Before I lost this weight, my periods had been quite erratic (anything from 18 to 35 days) and I'd had hysteroscopy treatment for fibroids a year or so before that. But now my cycle seems really long - 42 days and now 37 days and counting, so is this long cycle from weight loss or peri? Apart from an erratic cycle I haven't had too many other symptoms thankfully - very tender breasts being the most obvious one. Interestingly the blood test results showed a vitamin D deficiency, and taking a supplement has actually helped me feel heaps better emotionally. So I'm still left wondering whether stress (and I've been busy) is causing these long cycles or peri or a combination.... I guess I'm fairly unusual to be losing weight at my time of life (late 40s) but it's not at all deliberate! Sorry, this is a bit of a ramble. Perhaps another symptom of peri that I have is that I don't always make a lot of sense and start out thinking I know exactly what I'm going to say and then end up not being able to express myself at all!"

It sounds silly but I'm not entirely sure where it is originating from and I am really worried. I have not had a period in 2 years and have never had so much as a spot of anything down there since. That is why I am so worried about this, which started yesterday. I did have unusual itching for a couple of days and thought I was getting thrush. however, last night, when I wiped after my pee, I noticed brownish stuff on the paper. I used a liner today and noticed a brown coloured stain on it after a couple of hours. Earlier tonight I wiped after my pee again and this brown mucous was there a bit more. I don't know if it's gynae related or if it's from my urinary tract. I am scheduled for a cystoscopy on Monday to investigate microscopic blood in urine. Could it be that this has increased and has now become visible? I can't see my GP until late next week. I do feel tender in the pubic area but have no temperature and otherwise feel well. I have not noticed a smell. Sorry if this is too much information but I am hoping someone will come along who has had similar. You worry about everything at this stage in life. x"

jayneejay,2014-08-19T21:47+00:00,Vitamin B6 benefits during Peri & Menopause ..,"useful info for new ladies...  this helped me no end .. i take 150mg B6 daily in the morning..  also B12 for energy... brilliant  Menopause Mood Swings & Vitamin B6 Vitamin B6 may alleviate menopausal mood swings. During menopause, mood swings are inevitable with estrogen fluctuations as the body ends its reproductive years. Vitamin B6 may be one answer to alleviating increased agitation, depression and anger. B vitamins are responsible for mood stabilization by controlling hormone production in the brain and regulating hormone levels. B6 declines as menopause sets in and mood swings become evident. Increasing this vitamin may give women the added boost they need to enjoy the golden years with a better mindset. For women who suffer with brain fog, and memory issues in perimenopause, low levels of B6 could be part of the problem. Depression, confusion, and an inability to concentrate are all associated with B6 deficiency. Vertigo, dizziness, and heart palpitations are also common complaints from women going through perimenopause. All of these symptoms have been associated with (among other things) a B12 deficiency. Vitamin B6 can also help with stubborn weight gain in perimenopause. It is key in the breakdown and utilization of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins in our diet, and is necessary for a healthy metabolism - both which can help manage weight. **** B6 supplements of 100mg to 300mg per day ... depending on severity B6 may also assist HRT absortion if ladies are taking HRT."

Need encouragement!,"Hi all,  I'm just  47, was regular til last August, with no obvious peri signs, just lighter, shorter periods (4-5 days) for the past 7 years, when I missed a period for the first time. I had developed terrible constipation & felt very ill with it.  After that, by September, I literally don't know what happened. It was like my body literally went into shock & I ended up in hospital with a suspected heart attack. Uncontrollable body tremors, anxiety, panic attack, racing heart, dizzy, diahorea, pressure on my chest & throat, acid reflux. It wasnt a heart attack, but i continued to have these attacks almost daily for the next 3 months, with feeling woozy, nervous, spasms, jerking awake from sleep as soon as I'd nodded off, exhaustion, developed a dairy allergy, agonising reflux, sore tongue, 'lump in throat' tinnitus, vertigo, nausea, loss of balance, confusion, memory loss, stomach pain, chest tightness, breathlessness, joint pain, etc etc. I was so scared all the time! Some of those symptoms eventually subsided, but then the dark suicidal depression, blurred, darkened vision, utter exhaustion, despair, doom, rock-bottom emotions, racing heart literally just walking to another room. I almost black out sometimes. I feel like I've 'lost' myelf, and have that 'out of body' feeling. I can feel some kind of 'cycle' still happening, & have had erratic bleeding, flooding, light, and missed periods. When I could manage to get to my doctor, I had blood tests and was told I was 'post-menopausal' which is ridiculous, and that 'it looks like you've come through it.'  They chucked some HRT at me & anti-depressants, & anti-reflux & beta-blokas!!! I never take any meds normally. I tried the beta-blokas & had a horrific night, never again. I tried the anti-reflux but they made my head very very weird. Eventually I cut out dairy which stopped the reflux. I havn't used any thing else because of the side-effects, there's no way I could have felt more ill! I'd have had to have found a cliff to jump off!! I've been in hospital 3 times. I havn't been able to work the whole time, we have a great coffee bar, which my husband & sons are now running.  I can barely go out now because of the vertigo, disorientation and the feeling that nothing's real.  I had a couple of strange thyroid tests back, but the endocrine Dr isn't worried about them. I've lost so much weight, I'm now 7st 13lbs (50kg), although I am making myself eat great food in spite of the nausea!! Test for Addisons disease came back fine.

Ladies, I've really tried everything and am at the end of my rope.  So hoping some one out there might have a similiar story. I'm 60, and want to stop vaginal atrophy and have a somewhat normal sex life.   I tried BCPs in my early 20s, and in perimenopause in early 40s.  Both times a total disaster.  I tired bioidentical estrogen/progesterone in perimenopause, it was even a worse disaster.  Got to menopause without anything.  Felt ok, no hot flashes, or huge problems.  But three years in, started painful sex, vaginal atrophy and dryness.  I was given vaginal Estrace.  By regular use, I felt great, better than I had in years.  More energy, and sleeping like a champ.  The only down side, horrible itching on scalp and my hair started falling out.  Only thing that helped was some progesterone cream.  Since that time, I have worked with some of the best ""professionals"" out there.  I've tried creams, pills, vaginal suppositores, patches etc.  Various combinations.  I started low and wernt slow.  For a year worked with a known professional, who charged $3,500 up front cash and guartanteed she could make this work.  NOPE, I felt absolutely crappy on estrogen patches, and the only time I felt half way normal was when I also had progesterone with it.  Finally gave up on her promises and left her practice. So here it is, these hormones change how I look, my skin, hair and nails, my brain, how I sleep, YOU NAME IT!  But what I hate is that it's usually a bad thing.  Bad hair, bad nails, bad skin, bad feelings, bloating, weird sensations, feeling of fat growing on my legs and butt, etc.  Sometimes I think I am jinxed.   Are there any other older women out there who have had bad reactions to HRT?  If so, can you please share your experience? Did you find anything that worked?  Or did you give up?  Anyone just back to no hormone therapy?   If so, how do you feel now?  Am I alone on this?    I actually want to do hormone therapy.  I've personally bought into the theory that in the long run this will make us healthier and offset/avoid some of the effects of aging.  I've studied at nausium, paid dearly for (non) help, and done everything as suggested.  So what gives?   ANY ONE ELSE?"

Anyway my question is have any of you ' post ' ladies had dental issues ie shrinking gums, more dentist visits ( which I hate and dread ) ?? My teeth are not the same any more, ive had a couple of extractions and my gums have DEFINATLEY receded. My dentist disagrees with me that this is menopause related and frowned and shook his head when I asked him, but what does he know he's a man ! Anyway ive been refered to the hospital for sedation for deep dental work and now need dentures for the teeth ive lost, bit depressing but could be worse I suppose....... It would really help me confidence wise to hear from anyone else who's suffered anything similar ?? Thanks everyone and God bless xx"

So I decided to try an alternative approach rather than medication (we'll see how that goes).

I have had some good months since and although i missed a few periods over this year and half, they have been coming each month since, sometimes really short and some long ones of 10-12 days.  My symptoms were every day for months and then a few months of much lesser symptoms.  However... this has changed, as it does,  I am now having a horrible 7 days, the 7th/8th day after the start of bleeding, whether it has stopped or not.  Pain in ovary, nausea, aches in legs and heat in face/neck. It is lasting 7 days and although I am happier without the mental symptoms, these physical ones are now becoming unbearable.  It was suggested I have a mirena coil fitted and then some oestrogen by patch or gel after that.  I am thinking that my progesterone is extremely low and wondering if anyone has any ideas on this.    When the 7 days is over, I feel quite normal, so any ideas as to where I am in this journey would help me too.  thnks all."

jane63977,2017-03-04T08:58+00:00,Is it reflux ?,"I wonder if any of you ladies can help as I'm really worried . I have had so many health issues for the past year and a half including a breakdown in both my mind and my body following the death of my mum . That was really when all this began for me . I will be 50 in august and still have regular periods but feel like I have reverted to puberty , as I had a very bad time then . My main issue now is that sometimes at night I suddenly awake thinking I am going to be sick as I have phlegm and an acidy liquid in my throat . I have been suffering a lot with catarrh in my throat , runny nose and bad ears . I don't know if this is all linked . It makes me worried to go to sleep . I was only thinking yesterday that I hadn't had this for a while and then it happened again last night . It's almost like I willed it to happen . Apart from the fatigue , aches and pains , migraines , niggly headaches and just not feeling right , I'm great 😃 . Is this catarrh thing normal ? Thankfully my smear test has just come back clear , so that's a great plus point . Please help as I'm really concerned and worried I'm not normal . I've heard that reflux can cause cancer in the oesophagus . So much of a hypochondriac ! Sorry for going on . Jane"
jen81483,2017-02-24T16:50+00:00,Surgical Menopause,I'm currently waiting for a date to have my remaining ovary removed due to a new dermoid cyst (has the other one removed last year for the same.reason). I'm only 35 but have had my children so I'm not worried about losing my fertility but the menopause is a daunting prospect! Would anyone be able to share their experiences of surgical menopause and any advice to offer? I'll be starting on HRT immediately I have the surgery.
kya85,2017-03-03T15:32+00:00,A year of madness,"I had a hysterectomy when I was 29 everything taken except a quarter of an ovary. Diagnosed with hypothyroidism when I was 31. Well was merrily ticking along until 2014 when I suddenly lost my husband of 30 years, I was and still am devastated. But I thought I was doing okay. Then in January 2016 I started feeling very tired and depressed, decided I probably should get some help. Before I had chance I came down with what seemed like a tummy bug. It seemed to ease but I felt so hot and had continual headaches. This continued for a bit then bang in June constant diarrhoea and sickness, as this got worse I completely lost my appetite but had no hunger pangs or growling and couldn’t swallow. My insides felt like they were on fire, I then went on to get an horrendous pain in my lower back area. Next came a complete intolerance to heat along with internal and external shaking, elevated BP and tachycardia. Now starts the real madness I made the mistake of going to A &E, I went back and forth over the next 3 months having blood tests, scans etc. In this time I was misdiagnosed with kidney stones, then Crohns disease and then finally after testing my thyroid function was told I was over medicated and 1% away from a coma! This was a shock but at least finally I knew why I felt this way, so in their wisdom they decided to stop my meds, well within 2 weeks I was severely Hypo T again and had all this now to deal with. I won’t bore you too much with the following episodes but after getting worse I was rushed from my GP surgery with sever tachycardia (150bpm). At this point I have lost 2 stone due to the months of nausea, continual shaking, sweating to the point I wanted to rip my skin off to get rid of some heat, still can’t swallow, insomnia the list goes on basically I was a zombie. So there I was back at A&E for the 7th time having tests, only to be told absolutely nothing except my thyroid was still out of ranges and it would settle down. This was the last straw I paid to go privately to get my thyroid sorted once and for all omg why didn't I do this earlier. In the words of the endo “cobblers”, my thyroid was fine. He looked at my list of symptoms and really listened and analysed them. The answer if I had a stomach bug then my symptoms fitted more with post infectious IBS and menopause. He immediately said I was in a vunerable state and to stay away from over enthusiastic A&E drs. So away I came not completely convinced I didn’t have something terminal, but as he pointed out if it is something bad symptoms don’t come and go they are just there all the time progressively getting worse. So now it was down to me I was still shaking like mad, and had all the normal menopause symptoms and some more on top and had become afraid to go anywhere on my own so I decided I must be crazy it was time to see a therapist, try natural remedies etc etc. So where am I now. Still in therapy once a month for my unresolved grief. Symptoms are less. Wondering was that really me last year and saying to anyone hang in there it should get better. On reflection I did have a few indicators but not having cycles I missed them all, the most frustrating thing is not knowing where I am in the process I guess at 51 I am now post meno. But in the scheme of life its not important. Sorry for my long rant but needed to get it off my chest! Hope this helps someone."
tinabrina,2017-02-25T16:47+00:00,Over 7 years of the menopause & still no signs that it's coming to an end!!!,"I'm 58 now, I was 51 when I became aware that I had menopausal symptoms, hot flushes, night sweats, dizzy spells, dry eyes, pains in my lower back, forgetfulness, feeling that I can't cope, generally agitated & lack of interest in a lot of things & fluff growing on my chin!!!!! So off I went to my GP yesterday, as my husband said that I really ought to get myself sorted & get my life back in order. So my GP replied, every woman goes through the menopause, nobody escapes & I should just see it through & best not take HRT as it has risks! I tried to tell her that I really need to do something as it seems to be going on forever! & I said, what about these menopause clinics that I've heard about? She said that they'll not be able to do anything different than she can offer, they'll give me 10mins talking about the facts & ask whether I want to take HRT or not, considering breast cancer & other risks, I said I don't want cancer & then she said you can only have HRT for 5years anyway & then you'd go back to how you are now! & then she said that we're out of time! Can't say I found the experience too helpful! How long is this all going to last!?"
BugglyBot,2017-02-25T14:35+00:00,Meltdown Because Of How I Feel,"I feel absolutely shocking. Every time I start to have periods where I flush up, it wipes me out. I have dry eyes, I'm tired, off balance, dizzy, foggy headed, anxiety through the roof. My shoulder has gone again and I daren't go to the gym, which is frustrating me, for fear of collapsing. My biggest fear is that I'm Anaemic again because now, because of the Mirena Coil and my age, I don't have periods so I'm terrified about what could be causing it. I don't understand why the flushing seems to be connected to all of this and it happens every time. I had a meltdown earlier and my poor husband tried to calm me down. Our boys noticed it too, even though I try to hide it but I felt so bad earlier, I just couldn't and then I feel guilty for it, especially as our youngest son, (who's 17), is Autistic and he can't understand it the same as our older boys. I don't know what to do. I see the doctor next week and fingers crossed this really is perimenopause because I am scared there's something horrible going on. Does anyone else suffer like this? I know all you ladies do have the symptoms to varying degrees but can it really wipe you out for weeks at a time?"
KLH50,2017-03-02T20:24+00:00,Extreme Menopause,"I am 50 years of age. About 7 years ago I had my period constantly, night terrors, inconsolable crying, blaming my husband for everything. The Dr put it down to depression.To cut a long story short things got worse. After being a good loving mum for years and wife for 26 years my husband filed for divorce. I recently remarried and have come through the menopause and out the other side. My GP can't believe I wasn't offered HRT and said I had almost all the symptoms in the text book. My new husband is wonderful to me but I miss being a family and looking forward to being Grandparents together. I do believe the menopause caused this. It tore apart my family. Would be comforted to hear other stories and experiences."
Shazanne,2017-02-02T00:22+00:00,Something Weird Going On???,"I have a strange situation and wonder if anyone could offer advice or opinions. Firstly, I'm 55, on HRT for 5 - 6 years and all seemed to be going well. Then, at the end of December I began to bleed - period type bleeding with the old familiar lower abdomen pain but not anything as heavy as my period used to be.  It went on for two weeks to the day. I went to the Doctor in the early stages of bleeding, who sent me for an abdominal and internal ultrasound that showed thickening of the endometrial lining. So I was referred further for a biopsy. Over last weekend I began to have lower abdominal pain again (just a little over a month after it began last time). I had the biopsy on Monday and, as is normal, I had the usual cramping and light bleeding afterwards. This stopped by Tuesday afternoon completely, but my legs felt really tired and I was very emotional but put it down to the fact that the biopsy was over and I am now waiting for results. Then, to my amazement, when I got up this morning (Wednesday) I had period type bleeding again! It's heavier, has clots (sorry!) and I have a period type pain in my lower abdomen. I honestly don't know what is going on. It can't be a period as I couldn't have ovulated at 55 and on HRT for so long??!! I am due to go back for my biopsy results in 3 weeks time and, while I thought about it, I didn't call my gyneacology office today as I thought it best to wait to see what happens. But I'm baffled and worried and this site is like a lifeline as you get to hear from other women who may have experienced similar things. Can anyone help?"
Fairywren,2017-02-25T11:08+00:00,Physical Intimacy lessen peri symptoms ?,"Hi,     I was just wondering about the difference going through perimenopause with a spouse/partner compared to alone,if being sexually active actually  lessons the symptoms to a degree.I've read that being intimate can be beneficial in helping to regulate periods so I'm thinking there must be many more benefits I'm not aware of.My spouse and I are apart for months at a time due to work  so I don't experience it myself ,there's a lot of switching on and off with the physical intimacy.I imagine if understanding and closeness continues the transistion would be easier than alone also.Just don't know.

PGtips11,2017-03-01T21:29+00:00,Should I take it?,I had to come off HRT after having a mastectomy for breast cancer (DCIS). Hot flushes returned with a vengeance.

I noticed I can't do certain things that I used to do and eat/drink the way I used to. I had to cut out sodas for good (which is a good thing of course) because I would get a migraine afterwards, I had to cut out certain restaurants because they made me sick to my stomach afterwards. I had to cut out eating late and drinking alcohol too. Well last night was my best friends birthday so my husband and I took her out for drinks and dancing. I drank quite a bit but never felt drunk or even ""buzzed"" so anyway after the night was over, we went to eat at a 24 hour mexican restaurant at 2 a.m. After catching our cabs home and showering it was 4 a.m by the time we went to sleep. Well its now 8:30 a.m and I've been waking up off and on with a headache, stomachache, a pounding/racing heart and just feel so weak.

Well it has been 4 and some symptoms could be considered better but many have not improved. Fatigue for example. Also... I feel even more anxious wonderng why all is not better since the pill is aupposed to help peri. So now I think it must be not connected to peri and might be something bad.

My face seemed to get better when using moisturiser everyday but my chest/neck continued to itch even though I was using E45 itch relief cream. It has started to wake me at night around midnight then I find it really hard to get back to sleep because I just want to scratch. In desperation I went to the Dr last week. She was I felt quite dismissive, told me to stop using the E45 and all other bath/shower products and to wash my hair over the sink. She also gave me a 30 day course of antihistamine, some cream and prescribed oilatum shower gel. The pharmacist told me she can't get that so would get me something else after she spoke to the Dr. I didn't check until I got home but she gave me some E45 emollient shower wash which surprised me. I used it for the first time last night and through the night I was in hell. The itching is worse than it has ever been and I think I am going to go crazy if I don't get some help. My Dr said don't come back for a couple of months because it can take that long to settle. I will be hanging from a lamp post before 2 months of this are up. My questions...is it an allergy? It only really itches intensely at night which I think is due to be warm. There is no rash although it is red and horrible looking this morning from me scratching. The E45 itch releif seemed to help the itch but is it coincidence that after using the shower stuff I had the worst night ever? The cream she has given me is not helping at all. I started taking milk thistle back in November too as suggested by someone on here, I also take B complex, D3, calcium, Vit E, Maca root, chellated Mg and turmeric. Click here to view image"

Last year I got my sex drive back and I was so thrilled after not feeling this way for several years. I do suffer dryness and I take Vagifem twice weekly to help with this, although I'm not sure if it is helping really. I'm noticing that when we have sex, I feel numb and the sensation isn't as strong as it should be. It's really upsetting me because I enjoy sex but this is an issue that is stopping me from enjoying it even more. It's really getting me down now.  I do have an appointment to see my doctor on the 1st of March and, fingers crossed, she'll be able to suggest something. I'll buy whatever will help but I've no idea what I need.

Did ultrasound and tvu and said lining of womb was thick so needed further investigation. Tried to do the camera thing but it was so painful they had to stop. Now waiting for a date to have it done under general. Which Im not too impressed about as Ive never had one before! Also whilst doing ultrasound found a 'sack' in womb so stopped to do pregnancy test which was negative.

LadyPink,2016-08-30T15:47+00:00,LIVIAL(TIBOLONE) - A warning....,"Heloo Ladies, After 23 yrs of being on wonderful Tibolone/Livial and at the ageof 71yrs, I suddenly noticed Iwas getting a slight watery blood smeared discharge each day with a very mild aching in my lower tummy. As we were on holiday I waited until the next week and then saw my GP. She referred me to our local hospital where a month ago after a hysteroscopy plus biopsy, then a pelvic MRI scan - an Endometrial Cancer was discovered in my uterus. What a shock that was I knew the risk of long term use of this type of HRT but never thought it could happen to me. Two weeks ago I had a total hysterectomy removing the uterus, tubes and ovaries. The gynacologist is reasonably convinced that the cancer was caused by the long term use of Tibolone/Livial but as I presented to him in the early stages, it didn't appear to have spread beyond the lining. He is looking towards a positive outcome. We are now just waiting for the pathology reports to confirm this. Just wanted everyone on this type of HRT be aware of any changes they may notice going on and see your doctor if something doesn't seem right. If all goes well and say, in 8 weeks time I am hoping to return to Tibolone as my consultant has said, ""There is nothing left for it to harm and if this HRT makes you feel good I have no objections to you taking it"". Amazing! Best wishes, LadyPink"

For the past 6-7 months my periods have become increasingly painful. Pelvic pain, lower abdominal pain, pain in my hip joints, groin area and upper thighs. It really feels like labor pains. And then a couple of weeks before my last period, I had a sudden sharp pain on the right side. So bad it scared me, but was quick. It happened 2 more times that day and then just ached a little and then gone. I'm thinking ovarian cyst burst? Some endometriosis possibly? Do either one of these go hand in hand with peri? Do they usually resolve after peri? I know endo doesn't usually show up on US unless it's pretty bad, but she said we had to start there. Thanks for any info."

Last three weeks, I'm over reacting to everything at work and home. Feelings of impending doom, catastrophising and certain someone's going to die or something bad will happen. Anxious about all these intrusive thoughts. I'm not someone who ever had anxiety or panic attacs or any mental health issues. I have however had bad PMS before. Been thinking about changing job, going bacl to uni, fighting the urge to make a massive change just to get rid of these symptoms but know it's not the answer. Keep thinking job stressing me, in fact everythings stressing me ang again I'm a pretty unflappable person normally. Eat a good diet, not overweight.  Plan to start excercise routine as been off that following core surgery, don't think its helpful not excercising. Can't bear the thought of CBT talking therapy or going on anti depressants.  Apart from excercise - any ideas? Thanks ladies, I feel sure I'm not alone. Wendy"

lesleysharp1966,2017-02-01T09:20+00:00,Anxiety in the menopause,"Good morning ladies I have just signed up to this site and I already know it's going to be a massive help in this long journey of ours!! I was just wondering whether anyone else suffers from anxiety due to hormonal changes in the menopause.  I have been period free for the last 6 years now and thought that was it - I had got through with no problems!!  I was wrong. About 6/7 months ago I started having panic attacks and found it really difficult to work and go shopping etc as I found I was panicking at the slightest thing.  I was also bursting into tears for no reason but didn't really feel depressed, just tearful.  I carried on and then my father went into hospital for a week (thankfully he was absolutely fine) but after that really stressful week of worry my anxiety seemed to really take over.  I had 5 weeks off work and ended up taking Sertaline and HRT!!  I struggled through the side effects of the Sertraline as I wanted to feel better and get back to work.  I do feel so much better and am now back working but I still feel anxious particularly in a morning.  It is nowhere near as bad as before but its this morning anxiety that I really hate.  I am fine by about 11 am but still get anxious if I have to make any major decisions or if one of my elderly parents gets ill.  Does anyone else feel this way?  I don't think I am the only one!! I am sure it is hormonal/menopause based anxiety as I have never had it before and, even though I no longer have periods, each month I still get very bloated and get low stomach pains/dragging sensations.  This is when my anxiety gets worse around this time for a couple of days and then it seems to let up a little.  Any one in the same boat please? Thanks ladies and happy Wednesday to you all xx"

But now I seem like a different person. I have trouble retaining information, make the most basic mistakes and feel 'fuzzy' most of the time as if I am in a dream. This is having a terrible impact on my work. The rest of the staff didn't know me before and they all talk about me behind my back anf think I'm stupid. I have panic attacks and feel sick at the thought of going into work and my confidence has been so affected I have thought of suicide.

Crazydaisy72,2017-02-03T21:35+00:00,Ladies how do we make the best choices?,"So I have now had the most erratic irregular floods and periods for now 3 years and 5 months. There is no such thing as a cycle or period length. Some months I bleed continually, have a week off and start again and some months I go months without a period. In June I was perimeno and I will be honest I have had enough. Even though my period pants don't leak (and man have they been tested this week!) and even though I am keeping incontinence pads in business (why don't these companies make perimeno pads???) I just need an end in sight.  I have bravely or foolishly made an appointment to see the GP to talk hysterectomy and I would value anyone's input into making a good choice.  I can tolerate tranexamic acid but it makes me very tired, huge headache and upset stomach and leaves me agitated it might not work (it's only been tried 3 times in 8 months - sometimes I think my body could stop bleeding on it's own). I cannot tolerate mefamic acid as I can't have anti inflams, and I was nauseous with Norethisterone (and bled worse after it!)  I don't fancy Mirena as once it's in it can't come out and I am scared I will carry on bleeding and be an absolute cow. I don't fancy ablation as I would be the one to fail I think I cannot see the point in hysteroscopy for my thickened womb lining because if they are going in to look they might as well take it. And if a thickened lining might cause cancer later on they can take it all now.  I wanted to go natural but lately I feel the need for some predictability about my period - I have Adele tickets - how can I bleed through Adele????  So I just wanted some advice - anything and everything please. I have done multi vits as advised on here, no difference. I am not plagued by hot flushes although I get a few, I don't snap everyone's head off although I have the odd rant. I feel old and tired and grouchy but hey ho that's life and thankfully I can manage anxiety better than I used to and I am blessed with not having depression.  All I need is for the bleeding to stop or at least to know when it is coming Ladies if you are in menopause, how much longer do you think I have to go?  Should I try HRT? Should I try something else?  Please can you share the good, the bad and the downright bloody and help me go to this appointment armed as best I can.  Thank you lovely lovely ladies so much - this forum keeps me sane xxxx"

So I had the disaster with the Norethisterone and of course one tablet stopped bleeding although I felt like I was out of it and was in pain with stomach craps and so nauseous I couldn't eat. Anyone one night's sleep and I was like right let's go back to natural. So of course I started to bleed again and yesterday it ramped up from mild flood to am I actually going to bleed to death?  But thank God for Dr Google who can tell you whatever you need to know including how to catch the bleeding without leaking through all your clothes in the middle of a meeting....since Tuesday morning I have been combining the heaviest absorbency night time incontinence pad with sanitary towel with tight knicker. Downside is sanitary towel floods in now time - using ultra secure night super ones like. Thus making the incontinence pad useless....So I went today with just incontinence pad - okay we are getting 3 HOURS out of a towel and I might feel like I am 15 with a pillow in my knickers but leakage is not imminent. And then this afternoon my Mum arrived with period pants- OMG ladies we have waited 30 years for these pants. I don't know if you can name a brand but two celebs have just developed them and they have a waterproof panel. You wear them with sanitary towel and I am not so bold as to ditch the incontinence pad yet but they fit tight, a couple of leaks and they are supposed to hold them - all I can say is no blood around the edges yet and I don't even feel like I am bleeding to death.  I am having a big steak for tea keep my iron up but if you are flooding and want to be natural get yourself some period pants and some incontinence pads (you can register with the site and try for free the pads) and you too can be confident you are showing the world your reproductive system is giving you a crisis.  If there is such a thing as perimenopausal euphoria I definitely have it, I feel delirious with joy at the moment."

shawnalynn,2017-01-31T16:18+00:00,At a crossroads and I think it's due to menopause,"Hello, I am new to this forum just looking for a place to vent where others might be feeling the same way I am. Honestly, I feel as though I'm going crazy. A little over two years ago I was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Luckily, I just had to have a hysterectomy with an oopherectomy (1 ovary taken) with no radiation or chemo. Unfortunately, during follow ups, 6 months later the other ovary had to be taken as well. I still felt very lucky because no radiation or chemo was necessary. It was ALL GONE! After surgery, I felt great...there was so much pain involved with the cancer prior to surgery I thought my life was finally getting back on track! I thought over and over again, Menopause? What do people complain about? This is easy! Little did I know. Almost exactly one year to the date (which I've learned is normal) of what was called a forced menopause the menopause alien reared it ugly head. Initially, it was just some mild hot flashes and some minor insomnia. Now, the hot flashes have taken over my life and I can't remember the last time I didn't wake up at least 5 times a night. Obviously, the insomnia has had a lot to do with my mood as well. I keep thinking if I could just get a decent sleep then things would be better. My relationship with my husband is suffering and recently we've talked about separating. Sometimes I feel that he would just be better off without having to deal with me and my issues. Sometimes I feel I would be better off alone. He has been very patient but it seems he just expects that one day he will wake up and my menopause symptoms will have vanished over night. I'm tired constantly, I'm irritable, I'm depressed and I just don't know where to go from here."

wen06862,2015-02-26T18:21+00:00,"Really bad dandruff, oozing scabs on scalp","Hi All, Since my hyserectomy (2+ years ago) I've had all the usual menopause problems, probably made worse by having the hysterectomy, but that was unavoidable. My doctor and I are trying to sort out the best thing to do - Due to breast cancer being high in my immediate family and my blood problem, HRT is out of the question. (believe me we've gone down every route) I'm having sweats - night and day and have a wet scalp most of the time, these have got worse in the last 2 years. I leave my hair to dry naturally as a hair drier sound starts off my ears playing up (MD) I've been taking extra vitamins and minerals and supplements and changed my diet, to help, which they all do. the huge flakes of dandruff on my scalp, sometimes ooze clear liquid, occasionally blood. I wash my hair about twice a week. I'm disabled and need my partner or other help to do this and I can't cope with doing it more often as I'm drained of energy from coping with my MD, eye problems, sciatica and others. (the list is getting longer by the day. lol) I've tried every anti dandruff shampoo out there (polytar shampoo helps a bit, but a locally made rosemary, tea tree and cypress shampoo is the best so far and it's all natural ingredients. I can't use anything with added perfume.) I rinse my hair really well. I realise that this is not getting to the root of the problem, but suggestions are welcome. I'm on a healthier diet, which is also helping (don't mention the Valentine's day chocs though!!!!) I drink plenty of water (for other health reasons) and have my regular body mineral and vitamin checks to make sure I'm not lacking in anything -  so far I haven't been. Oh, and I don't scratch my head, been told not to by hairdresser! Has anyone had the same problem? Oh, Also, I have never had dandruff in my life before the menopause."

A few of you advised how you feel and that you had come of the pill. I just wanted to know if you found that your symptoms improved? I am seriously considering stopping the pill especially as they have just taken me off the combined pill and put me on a mini pill which is different hormones, And i gotta say i feel worse if that is possible with the change. I am now on levothyroxine for an underactive thryoid but according to the encrologist this is suffient at the moment for my thyroid levels so why do i feel so horrible still? Its got to be peri or the pill. Can i have good or bad stories about whether you felt better on or off the contraception pill please? Thanks for reading Kind regards Kerry"

Psychological symptoms of menopause Studies indicate that many cases of depression, for example, relate more to personal circumstances than to the menopause itself. Studies have also indicated that women who are generally happy with their lives experience fewer problems during menopause. I'd say i was normal woman, bit fed up at times with husband, children etc but I'd say I was generally happy with life, then this hell has happened!"

HopeAgain,2017-01-17T04:02+00:00,Skin Eruptions Or Blisters,About a year ago when I went through actual menopause I started getting these little blister type eruptions across my nose and cheeks. The dermatologist swabbed it and it is never an infection. Steroid creams take it away but I want to know what it is. She said it was dermatitis but I just started getting them a year ago. Anyone have this? My face turns red and these little blisters pop up and burn and itch horrid. Not sure if it is related to menopause or not but thought I'd ask.
margie1982,2017-01-18T14:51+00:00,Sweating at night,"Hello. I have some questions and thought maybe some of you ladies could help.. I am 34 years old, fairly healthy I'd like to think..mother of two girls and one angel. I have one ovary. I lost the other one during my second birth (c-section), due to a very large dermoid cyst. I have a smaller dermoid in my remaining ovary, but my RE and I have chosen to watch it for now, as removing it could cause a decrease in ovarian function and we are ttc. My period have always been regular despite losing the ovary (six years ago). I had my AMH and all other hormones tested last year, and they were fine. Ended up pregnant after trying for 17 months, last march, and sadly, lost her at 22 weeks. So now we are trying again. We lost her in August of 2016 (5 months ago) and started trying again in November. Well, for the last few mknths, I have been experiencing night sweating. It happens almost every night. I am not drenched...but my chest is always sweating, and depending on the night, the back of my neck and groin. It never touches the sheets or pillow, but my shirt and underwear are sometimes damp. I mentioned it to my RE, who said it isn't perimenopause and didn't say much more. I know I am young, but I only have one ovary and it has a cyst. I am so afraid it is perimenopause. Wondering if it could just be hormonal or anxiety related. I don't have any other symptoms! What were your first signs of peri and did you have regular periods still? Thanks and sorry for rambling!"

Jay91157,2017-01-16T12:50+00:00,Menopause,"I recently went to my GP as I have concerns about the amount of facial hair I am experiencing, I am  59.  We are talking as high up as the cheek bone all the way down to the jaw line beard, moustache and under the chin. The night sweats are like a river and I have to get up and shower at least once in the night. I can cope with the sweats but not the facial hair. I went to the GP( a woman) who I thought would be understanding. She basically told me thats part of the menopuase for some and nothing available on the NHS, apart form HRT but I did not want to go down that route and she said it would not help the facial hair. I know HRT  delays the process so I do not see the point, and it would not stop the facial hair. She did do a blood test on the thyroid which was normal. I was basically told to either get laser treatment or electrolysis. She had no sympathy and was quite blunt about it all. The pain I go through everyday is causing me so much stress. I have heard work colleagues making fun of me. As the facial hair is mainly blonde with  just a few darker ones I am on the understanig laser treatment does not work on fair hair, otherwise I would find a way to fund it. Ihave source a few private clinics for laser treatment and they have all said laser does ot work on fair hair and also if it is homonal there is a good chance it will continue to grow back. I know electrolysis does work is very expensive and can take years and it is  very painful. I have so much hair it would take a life time to get rid of it, so this does not seem an option. I know waxing is another option but it would be every week and who knows what the hair would be like once it is touched. The GP did not say it could be anything else. Anyone have advice I would welcome it. Or if there is another medical condition that could be causing it."

Can you have hot flashes and nightsweats whilst taking the birth control pill ?

I've had a lot going on this year, appendix removal, UTI which I'm currently being treated for... the list goes on. My doctor says the pill should be masking those hot flash symptoms etc. I have been tested earlier last year for hormones and one was slightly raised the FBC or FBH? can't remember. They tested again and it was normal !  So i figured perhaps I'm not perimenopausal after all. Then I was put onto microcynon. I'm planning to have another hormone test done in February at the end of a pill break week, to see how things are then. Does anybody have any idea though ??? Thanks Caroline"

Most doctors are not skilled in the mechanics of hormones and the effects it has on the body. Especially for women. Many women are just given a prescription for anxiety, and a referral for the psychiatrist. I think they just don't know where to begin when it comes to dealing with women who are experiencing hormonal changes. Hormones are so complexed, and their job of keeping everything balanced is so huge.

For two days after administering I had light uterine contractions,intensifying then ebbing .   Has anyone else had these or other strange sensations of your body telling you somethings up?   4 weeks ago I missed a period and had another ultrasound that showed I had a total of 5 simple cysts in my ovaries all together about the size of a grapefruit.I had felt a bit bloated and missed the one period, but there are no other symptoms."

michelle46271,2017-01-09T12:35+00:00,Declining estrogen sore stiff joints,"Hi ladies I cannot believe that my sore,stiff joints are due to low estrogen. 2 years ago I was playing badminton and swimming with no sore joints. Now I have osteoarthritis in my big toe. My fingers are stiff and hurts to bend in the morning. The last week my wrist hurts to move. It's like I'm 90 not 47. I take all the oils and am on HRT but I still have it. God knows what it would be like if I didn't take anything. I've been through a terrible 2 years with the most awful symptoms: To begin I had headaches every day,depression,anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn't even take my kids to appointments. I could never plan anything in advance. Then I had burning mouth syndrome for 6 months. I don't sleep well at all which I know is one of the main symptom. I've had this for years. However 4 months ago I started a new part time job which I never thought I could do. I love it. It engages your brain. These joint aches are a nightmare,my doctor suggested a cortisone injection. Could it be I'm quite a way into my journey of menopause?"

I was given HRT but was taken off it after 3 months due to headaches. I've had no periods now for 14months. This part of it is great for me but I feel like absolute crap. I'm having loads of hot flushes mainly in the evening and through the night, and a couple of nights ago woke up absolutely soaking wet so much so I queried whether I'd wet myself!!! My memory is appalling and I walk around most of the time in a fog. I feel really low and feel completely useless. Maybe it's a midlife crisis? My sleep is appalling; I wake up after 2 hours and stay awake until I feel like I am nodding off which is usually about 4 hours later. I get itchy at night and basically don't feel like me. Does anybody know if this is maybe due to my hormonal changes or if there's anything I could take apart from HRT that may help these symptoms? Also, how long does it go on for? Any advice would be much appreciated!!!!!"

My question is can your blood pressure rise when your going through the change because this all seems to have happened since I haven't bleed at all. My doctor is now talking about putting me onto blood pressure tablets now so I am little confused by all this. Oh and he also said my migraines should be getting better as I'm not bleeding now so more confusion.  Any advice or help would be much appreciated  Thank you Karen"

patty818,2016-06-20T13:37+00:00,"Hot flashes,night sweats, dizziness & anxiety???","Hi I've been having a bit of a hard time.  I'll give you alittle info about me, I'm 53, I am hypothyroid, have recently been diagnosed with migraine associated vertigo (MAV), have health anxiety and GAD.  Alittle aboutthe MAV, I have dizziness on most day sometimes all day, it feels like I'm  rocking on a boat or bobbing in the water, it comes with headaches, neck pain and upper shoulder pain on both sides of the body.  Its an awful thing to have because you are dizzy, off balance, tired, headaches, anxiety comes with it as part of the disorder.   During perimeno I was a complete wreck, my panic and anxiety was off the charts, this is when the health anxiety started, I started peri when I was 46 and that lasted for about 2.5 yrs.  Then things settled down.   When I went into full meno about 4 years ago my last period was 3 yrs ago, I was so so for about a yr after last period then the hot flashes started, they weren't so bad, but in the past 1.5 - 2 yrs they ahve increased and lately become must worse.  I tried HRT but it makes things so much worse.  Now I have them a few times a day with much increased sweating sometime I have to wipe my chest and upper stomache with a cloth and my forhead gets drenched.  Does anyone have this with hot flashes? My night sweats are causing drenching at times followed by freezing, do anyone have this?  THis can happen a couple of time during the night, does anyone else have them more than once with freezing thing? I'm also noticing more that before the hot flash I will feel the dizzy off balance coming on then increasing with the hot flash.   i've read dizziness can come with the hot flash.  Does anyone feel it before the flash and worsening during the flash?   Of course my anxiety can get pretty bad because of all of this.  I've noticed more and more I don't want to go out much and when I do I just want to rush thru whtever I'm doing, like standing in line at a store, I want to run out, I don't like doing things I used to.  I know with the  MAV and it causing anxiety, I have more than one thing going on, so I guess the mixture could be making it all worse.  I have tried meds but I've had such bad problems with them I quit trying them.  I do take xanax when I need to, but that only about once or twice a week if I need to. I really hoped that after 3 yrs of no period the meno when be about over, but it doesn't seem that way.  My gyno has told me the hormone levels can continue to drop for years and the hot flashes can last up to 15 yrs.  Its all so confusing.   I'm seeing a psychologist about the anxiety and hoping that will help.  If anyone can give any help I would so appreciate it.   Thanks for listening"

gailannie,2016-12-31T22:17+00:00,Does it change over night for many of us?,"Ladies,     This topic may be a little off base.  But here's the question I'd love to have answered by WOMEN. And who knows, I may be mixing the menopause and aging issue into one big ball, when they actually need to be seperated.     I felt like I got to menopause pretty well intact.  I did.  None of those hot flashes, night sweats, or any of the many symptoms we usually hear of.   But then, several years later, I really took a dive.  Not feeling right, not sleeping well, vaginal atrophy and dryness.  My skin and hair started changing in very negative ways. I didn't feel good at all.  One endrocrinologist suggested that I was one of those women who went into menopause with a relatively high estrogen level, which held steady for quite a while.   So my question is, while I know we are all very different, did YOU see tremendous changes in your physical being immediately at menopause, or did it take several years before you really saw some change.  I know there is a portion of this that is simply the aging process.  But it makes me wonder, and am hoping other women will share their personal experience.  Cause I'll be honest, I don't like what I see right now."

Indifferent,2017-01-02T22:01+00:00,Health Benefits of Gelatin and Bone Broth During Menopause,"*****This is very basic, you really should research some of this on your own******and also research the effects of too much gelatin so you know. You can buy dry unflavoured gelatin in the grocery store, or you can boil down the bones of beef to use daily in soups to get the health benefits as well. Here is what gelatin can do for you.  I know, because it has done it for me time and time again.  I used the powdered form for three months the first time to heal fibromialgia symptoms and bowel issues.  It worked amazing.  I stirred two LEVEL tsp into my tea every morning for three months at first, and now use it sporadically just to make sure I keep it part of my diet.  I also make my own broths often from the bones of cows, and chickens, and use them to make soup at least once or twice a week. Make sure you drink lots of water when doing this, and research it more on your own. Promotes healthy bones (essential for women in menopause) Assists the liver with detoxification processes, assisting to rid the body of toxins Aids good digestion, restores gut lining and promotes a healthy gut – gelatin absorbs water, helping to keep fluids in the digestive tract, which assists bowel movements Assists with food allergies and intolerances Reduces joint pain Fights inflammation (in muscles too!) Inhibits infection (think colds and flu) and helps wound healing Assists with beautiful skin – gelatin provides glycine and proline, two amino acids that are used in the production of collagen… and is thought to protect against the aging effects of sunlight Promotes hair and nail growth Improves sleep quality Provides a good source of protein Helps with anxiety Assists with weight loss – increases the production of Human Growth Hormone and boosts metabolism"

It was a tough year and a half. I moved several states away to a new area, with what turned out to be the house from the money pit. This was me trying to get a home on my own for me and my kids after a tough divorceaftet 20 years. I'm47 btw. So after going through dizziness, nausea, pain in the joints, muscle pain., not thinking right... And what I now know it's health anxiety... And maybe just plain anxiety, feelings of dread...I can't see or hear anything upsetting ... tingling in arms and legs, bone cold chills,, and for a short period of time tremors that only I could feel but none could see. Lets not forget about fatigue,, dry skin and my face is definitely aging! I've had every test possible at every dr and finally found this message board. After reading what you all have shared I found some peace and strength. Thank you so much. Right now I am learning to be good to myself... I'm used to being the over achiever who takes care of everyone around her. I guess my body is telling me its tired of being in the back seat! I went to an endocrinologist and told her about what I suspected... That my symptoms are hormone related. She said based on my age that I'm surely in peri. She did blood work and everything came out ""normal for my age"". I remember her saying my estrogen was 195 . I get regular periods. I did pretty good the last two weeks and then two days ago my symptoms came back bad... And I realize I am in day 21 of my cycle. Is there a connection? I'm going to get myself a saliva test today and see if I can gather more info. I go to a menopause integrative specialist Feb 9 . Right now my biggest anxiety is the heart palpitations. I take chamomile tea to relax when I'm anxious. Do you think it would help that? Thanks so much I know this was a long post! I'm very open to getting to know anyone going through this and supporting each other so feel free to message me. God Bless!"

Then stopped using it for almost a year because I travelled, I returned to using it and I had terrible itching, I had to go to the hospital and I was given an injection, it relieved me in 3 days . It didn't itch me the 1st time so I don't know what could have caused the itching. I stopped it but I want to go back to using it now but scared. What can I do to prevent or stop itching so I can start using it again? The maca capsule I used then was a NOW product but the one I have now is Peruvian maca. Thanks"

jayneejay,2014-08-28T14:07+00:00,Magnesium Supplement in peri / Menopause helps insomnia taken just before bedtime,"Hi ladies.. I have been using magnesium and calcium for a while now, they work well together.. However i switched to calcium and Vit D ( Natecal ) chewable .. no longer having the magnesium ...  then i started effervescant magnesium ... i always take this by dropping in a glass of water, they range from lemon - orange flavour etc.. what I want to share is, as I have been an insomniac all through peri etc, I have  found that the effervescant form of magnesium, that you fizz and drink has totally relaxed me before sleep, i find myself in a lovely relaxed mood, and ready for slumber ...  Since this little difference, i have been researching magnesium and it also helps, tightened muscles, headaches, aches and pains.. worth a try ugh ? Drink it 30 mins before you go to bed ... Magnesium has many benefits to good health, one of them being its action as an effective natural sleep aid.  James F. Balch, M.D., author of Prescription for Nutritional Healing, writes: “A lack of the nutrients magnesium and calcium will cause you to wake up after a few hours and not be able to return to sleep.”   Chronic insomnia that occurs with frequent night time awakenings is one of the main symptoms of magnesium deficiency.   On the other hand, a high magnesium diet has been found to be associated with deeper, less interrupted sleep. This was proven in a study done by James Penland at the Human Nutrition Research Center in North Dakota. Mildred Seelig, M.D., the leading medical researcher on magnesium says: “Many people needlessly suffer pain – including fibromyalgia, migraines and muscle cramps – because they don’t get enough magnesium.” According to the University of Maryland Medical Center web site, inadequate magnesium also appears to reduce serotonin levels in the brain.   One study found that magnesium was just as effective as an antidepressant drug in treating depression.  In addition, researchers at Stockholm’s Karolinska Institute reported that for every 100 milligram increase in magnesium intake, the risk of developing type-2 diabetes decreased by 15 per cent.  Other studies have shown that people with migraine headaches have low concentrations of magnesium in their body. i intend to post more magnesium finding as i find them  this I totally second this info above as I really noticed a difference after taking effervescant magnesium before bed , and my curiosity lead me to find out more .. jay xx"

I was told this wouldn't change anything. So wrong!!!!!! my periods are regular but I'm moody, irrational, so negative, p*ssed off with the world, sooooo tired, no energy. Other symptoms but it's my moods and my overactive mind that is driving me and my family nuts. I can't go on HRT as I have a family history or breast cancer, but I'm desperate.

She does not have a partner. She has adult children, but they aren't always helpful.  Tonight I brought her dinner and dessert. After the holidays I thought of paying to send my cleaning lady over there just to do the bathrooms and kitchen. I volunteered to go to medical appointments and drive for her afterwards.

I posted a couple of weeks ago about my period changes and a lot of you made me feel so much better ?? Now I'm worrying again and really need some support. About three weeks ago I started 'spotting'. Felt like I had my period but really didn't have much blood at all. First day used a tampon but then didn't need one as the blood was only when I wiped. That was about three days then a day or two of nothing and then another four days of the spotting nonsense.  After that I felt a lot better and carried on, encouraged by the lovely ladies here.  Well I started 'spotting' again the other day (after about a week with nothing). Hardly anything at all but it has happened a few times. Again, just when I wipe. And again I feel like I have my period.  I am am reading a lot and watching stupid YouTube videos and everything is making me feel like this is NOT normal in peri and that something serious is wrong. I think I've had some minor spotting prior to periods a few times in the past year but nothing like this.  Im really freaking out. I can't think straight and just feel like crying. I don't know if this is spotting or just crazy light periods super close together! I feel so lost and have no one in my life who can help 🙁 I had had to leave work early today. I felt so anxious and scared about literally everything."

Guest,2005-07-27T10:18+00:00,I have been using Tibolone (Livial) for three years now....,I have been using Tibolone (Livial) for three years now. I previously used HRT patches but due to the length of time I had been using my GP suggested that Tibolone would be better for me. I have had previous hysterectomy and bowel resection due to Endeometriosis. I am now 49 years of age and HRT started at approx 29 years old. I had one son at the age of 27 and had a miscarriage at age 29 when I was 5 months pregnant. I have some concerns regarding Livial as I am currently experiencing - Joint Pain Severe Muscle Pain Some Visual blurring Fluid retention Very low metabolism (despite trying very hard to motivate and move around as much as possible) Require rest and sleep often Unexplained weight gain or fluid retention ? I have been attending my GP for the last 4 months back and forth with muscle and joint problems and also some swelling in the neck area. Some blood tests have been done but at the moment nothing has been found. Apparently Thyroid results are normal. A swelling ocurred on the lower right side of my neck around early February. I have not to date received a scan to diagnose the problem despite repeated visits to the practice and also visiting a private consultant in Murrayfield Edinburgh who wrote to the GP practive a number of weeks ago and who recomended that this should be done. I was suspicious at first that I had a thyroid problem but the blood results do not show. My concern therefore now is that Livial is causing my symptoms and I need to establish whether this is the cause or not and whether to continue with livial or not under the circumstances. Visiting the web site has been of benefit to me in order that I can read current research on Livial as I am extremely concerned that I have gone from a fit well active person to the current pain and progressive problems I am now experiencing.

I looked up about this online and found that there is something called 'Burning Mouth Syndrome', which often happens first in the menopause, and where you have a really sore mouth but it looks fine, and tests dont reveal that anything is wrong.  I am sucking mouth ulcer tablets and using antiseptic spray which does help somewhat. I also ordered some alpha lipoic acid tablets which I read have helped with some people with this.

Not to the point where I sweat,  just feeling warm which is uncomfortable.  I take Pregabalin for the anxiety and also take Mirtazapine for sleep.  I wanted to ask if anyone takes medication and also any herbal remedies. I did ask my doctor about them but they said they wouldn't recomment it. And I'm sure some meds can't be taken with some remedies. I haven't seen my doctor about it yet and some can just pass it off as only anxiety."

jayneejay,2014-10-09T17:05+00:00,Menopause & Post Menopause Phase .. useful info..,"The Menopause And Postmenopause Phase After you reach menopause (periods have stopped for 12 months) things start to calm down a bit. Hormone levels settle at a lower level, mood swings stabilize and hot flashes subside. Your body begins to accept its new level of estrogen production, although a small percentage of women continue to suffer menopausal symptoms for another few years. In the longer term, consistent lower levels of estrogen cause some new physical changes to your body. These include: Menopause Symptoms Vaginal dryness: Medically called vaginal atrophy, low levels of estrogen can cause the vaginal tissue to shrink and dry out. It is most noticeable when sexual intercourse becomes painful without lubrication. Vaginal dryness is the most common cause of painful intercourse in women. Vulva itchiness: The skin of the vulva dries and can become itchy. However always ask a doctor to check any changes in your vulva, as there are many other causes. See reproductive system disorders. Urinary incontinence: The muscles and tissues in the urinary tract become weaker, so you might have leakages of urine when you laugh or sneeze.  Urinary frequency: The need to urinate more often than you used to. Weight changes: Body fat shifts to the center of your body, away from the arms and legs to settle in the waist. This means you take on a more apple body shape appearance. This doesn't necessarily mean you gain weight, but a larger tummy may mean you still need to go up a dress size. See weight gain and menopause. Low libido: Decreased sex drive is a common problem in menopause and it can usually be traced back to testosterone levels being too low. See low libido in menopause. Depression: If you have been taking estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) to cope with the side effects of menopause (rather than going through the natural weaning process), you may find you are suddenly hit with a wall of depression when you quit.  Extra Problems Estrogen is a miraculous hormone (as no doubt you are beginning to notice) - as well as all the wonderful functions it controls in our body, it also acts as a protector. It helps protect against bone disease (osteoporosis), heart disease and a host of other medical conditions. Once we hit menopause, we are no longer protected in the same way, which is why the risk of heart attacks, coronary heart disease and osteoporosis suddenly increase. For this reason, regular health screenings become even more important, as well as taking regular exercise, maintaining a healthy body weight and eating a balanced diet."
Lara66,2016-06-15T10:15+00:00,Hot Flushes Like Never Before !,"Hi ladies. I'll be 50 in 2 weeks and have never felt so rough. I've had peri symptoms for about 5 years, a few hot flushes a day, about one a night with erratic sleep patterns, irregular periods, the odd bit of nausea etc etc. I've been thinking to myself that it's ok. If it doesn't get any worse, I can cope with it, but for about a month now, the hot flashes are almost constant, day and night. Woke up this morning feeling very nauseous. Went to work and my boss sent me home! That's never happened. I can usually manage, but not today. Trying to give up alcohol completely while going through menopause but it's hard. But whether I drink or not, the hot flushes have become unbearable. I have a docs appointment next Monday and, for the first time, I'm considering asking for HRT. But I don't want to get dependent on it. My friend is 65 and still takes it and every time she tries to stop, she has panic attacks and hot flushes so goes back on it. What are the best types of HRT? Advice appreciated."

I am on low dose hrt of estrogel - just 1 pump nightly , & utrogestan capsules for 12 days month. i also have the depo provera progesterone injection for contraception(can't be used as the progesterone part of my hrt as it's unlicensed for that use hence the utrogestan capsules). I have been on the depo injection for 4yrs, & only started getting erratic & prolonged periods last 2yrs so its not the depo causing it. My ultrasound has come back with thickened womb lining of 11mm & endometrium & myometrium appear merged (report wording). sonographer has recommended gynae assessment of uterus.  I just thought progesterone was supposed to keep the lining thin??? anybody know?  I have other concerns obviously but cannot do anymore until some gynae follow up done, but would like to know what effect progesterone ""should"" be having on the womb lining.

Lama22,2016-12-09T13:35+00:00,Premature menopause,I was wondering if anyone has been diagnosed with premature menopause regardless of current age. I was diagnosed many years ago and never questioned causes or reasons. I just sort of got on with it. My GP prescribed me HRT and was vaguely sympathetic but never explained or sent me for tests.  My mother had a  baby at 40 yrs so not hereditary. i don't know why is bothering me now but i never really let anyone know what I was going through as seemed little point. Just curious as to whether anyone has any views or opinions about this topic.

It went away and then a week ago I started bleeding again but this time it was bright red. My husband took me to the er because I had pelvic cramps too and I was scared. I also have a history of fibroids and endometriosis. They said the lining of my uterus is making it the size of a 4 month pregnancy and my fibroids aren't that big. I was told to follow up with my gyno within a week. The next morning I called my gyno but their message kept saying they were closed. Around 4:30 my gyno called me saying that the e.r. doctor called them and said to put me in for the following morning (which is today) and she (the e.r.) Dr would be there to do a endometrial biopsy.

wendy82992,2016-12-09T16:12+00:00,"Never ending bleeding, all treatments make it worse","Hello.  I am 49 years old and appear to be in perimenopause.  Unfortunately, instead of my periods becoming less frequent, they are becoming more frequent and lasting longer.  The first treatment my doctor tried was to put me on the pill.  Instead of keeping it away, my period started a few days after starting, progressively getting worse until it was continuously gushing out of me.  I had to stop or risk needing a transfusion.  I only lasted 6 weeks. Next, she tried a shot of depo provero that was supposed to last for 3 months.  My period stopped for 2 weeks (a record for me since this started) but then started again.  It isn't heavy like on the pill but it hasn't stopped.  That was nearly 3 months ago.  It's a steady bleed that runs all day, all night 24/7 without letting up.   I've been back to the doctor but she can't do anything more until this shot has worn off so I have an appointment in the first week of January. When I was in last she talked about other options including another pill, the mirena, and other hormone-based treatments.  Honestly, these hormones don't seem to work for me. I'm pretty sure she won't even consider me for a hysterectomy until she's run the gambit of all other possible treatments.    I can't continue living like this .  I cry all the time.  It's hard to work and my relationship with my husband is suffering.  I can't talk to anyone because it is shameful.  I'm terrified to take another hormone in case it affects me like the pill did.  On the other hand maybe if something like that happens they'll give me an emergency hysterectomy and end this hell for good.   Other than this I have no other symptoms (other than fatique and dehydration).  No hot flashes (actually I am chilled all the time), cramps or anything.   Please help!"

But we can't just let go what is happening inside of us can we.  We cannot escape it, nor can we run from it or ignore it.  We have to somehow roll with it and learn to deal with it.  And in that, if we pay attention, comes much learning about ourselves. I think the menopause, if we allow it, brings us to a point of freedom from many things we have carried with us in our lives.  I think getting there is the most difficult journey our inner self will ever make.  But we will get there.  Some of us kicking and screaming all the way.   Some of us will learn to enjoy the journey.  My hope is to figure out how to enjoy the journey. And them rabbit holes...avoid them at all costs.  I hit the first one like running in to a brick wall.  It took me by surprise.  A HUGE surprise. I am hoping the next one won't be so traumatic...and I am told there will be more to come.   These days I don't care if my butt is getting wider...if my boob hurts, if my head has pressure I don't care that I don't have the attention span of a two year old right now.  It is ME TIME And if the dishes don't get done, too bad.   I can't do all the things I used to do these days.  I am forgetful and can't think very well, but that is ok.  I am going to enjoy the bubble baths, and the good books, I am going to wake up in the morning and get out of bed simply because I still have legs. I am going to enjoy the rest.  I am going to TAKE the rest.  I deserve it.  I have served this family for so many years that they can learn to not have to lean on me for everything anymore. If I don't feel like making dinner, we will go out The pressure is off, and I feel much better. In the meantime I am going to learn all I can about me, and about how to deal with the meltdowns more gracefully when they come. And when I come out the other end of this, I am going to be changed in so many great ways, that the pain of getting there will be forgotten...like childbirth. Stay positive ladies.  It's hard.  but think of something to do for YOU today.  And every day.  Remember, it takes a caccon to make a butterfliy."

My husband said a loud bang cannot be the cause of this and he thinks it's having the extraction and me focussing and worrying the bang has caused this The reason I'm asking ladies is I had burning ears without the tooth pain a few months ago and heard it could be menopause related.

Just a cuddle every now and again but he is not the snuggly type.  I have felt so close to a brakdown the last two months.  Craving his affection which he is not giving. And this morning, after i slept in the spare room for the fifth time this month he told me i would probably be happier if i left. I responded with ""I will go back to my home town"" He helped me pack...in a huge snowstorm, and he knows I dreadfully fear driving in storms. I have no job.  I have never worked outside the home. My soul has just shattered.  I left, but I really have no idea where to go. You see i have always put my family in my #1 priority I don't even have any friends, they are all his friends since i moved to his home town twenty years ago and never had time to make any of my own. My heart is broken, I am so scared. He asked me if I have enough money to get a place of my own...I said yes, out of anger.  I would have to steal it from his account for the first month, but what then?  How can I sign a lease when i have no job and no skills outside the house?  I am such a mess at this point in my life that anyone would be crazy to hire me. I've been abandoned at the worst time in my life after I have given him my whole life.

Pamapause58,2016-11-21T01:13+00:00,Wow...what's going on?,"This is the first time I have ever done an online support group.  But I need to know if other's are experiencing what I am.  I can see they are.  I had regular periods all of my life.  When I was 56, I had an Endometrial ablation.  It has been wonderful not to have periods any more.  However, my menopausal symptoms are over the top.  (Started two years ago, so I seem to be a little later to the game!) My hot flashes are often, one to three an hour, and very extreme.  I ignite like a heating pad in high position.  My husband can feel them coming on when he touches my back or body.  (Luckily I am married to a gem of a man and he is very supportive, but it makes me feel bad that he has to deal with this new me).  After the flashes, I am freezing cold.  I carry a fan and coat wherever I go no matter what the temperature.  I feel nauseated a great deal of the time.  I feel irritated easily and work hard to control that.  I have always maintained a healthy and active lifestyle.  I have been a very active grandma with my grandchildren-involved playing with them, exercising, etc.  My switch has flipped.  I am tired, don't feel like doing much, along with all the other symptoms I just mentioned.  I had my gallbladder out last spring which turned into a nightmare experience.  So sick for months and just started feeling a little better when my menopause vamped up.  I have back and neck pain, feet hurt when I walk.  It's not ME...or I guess now it is.  That is the really hard part-trying to adjust to this new person I have become and the new lifestyle I am having to live.  Any way, I have worked with my doctors and tried different things.  No luck yet-like some of you-tests come out mostly normnal, Yeah right!  I am going to switch up and get some new medical professionals on board and try accupuncture.  Thanks for listening to me vent.  I feel for you all and see it can be so different for each individual.  I just have feared more serious illness with all of these symptoms, but I am going to try to calm down and keep labeling it all as menopause.  If anyone discovers a magical bullet-please let us know!"

Actiquser,2016-11-17T14:35+00:00,Ongoing menopausal symptoms,Hi just wanted people to be aware if they have ongoing menopausal symptoms for more than 2 years it needs investigation. Mine went on about 4-5 years and I regularly went to the Doctors about it. It turned out for the last 2 years I had had carcinosarcoma of the uterus. Needless to say it had spread. So ladies if your symptoms continue insist on a full examination and dont be like me and just accept that a GP always ios right despite logic telling me the time scale was all wrong for ongoing menopausal symptoms.

They are not particularly pleasant either.  Also I have a rogues hair which is the consistency of a pubic hair which grows under my chin.  Just one and it can grow very long in a matter of days.  I keep shaving it to get rid but it grows back every so often.  My periods are also very irregular now.  Recently I haven't had one for 3 months then I had one for 10 days (very heavy) with a weeks spotting then another 10 days of bleeding.  I'm 54 and suffer with severe health anxiety also.  I find my boobs get very tender and I sometimes get little sharp pains in them and I feel bloated as well.  Is this pretty normal for Menopause and if so Is this it in full swing now?  Any help would be appreciated.

I was resting yesterday afternoon and I somehow jerked my head the wrong way and now it seems I have this terribly painful muscle strain in the back of my neck. I have to turn my whole body if I need to look back. Of course this triggered all kinds health anxiety thoughts. I know me accidentally jerking my neck is what started it but I didn't think it would feel this bad! I heard that estrogen can make you more sensitive to pain and I am on my period right now too. Forgive me if I'm babbling. Just wondering if anyone is more susceptible to pain when their period is on?

I need your help in deciding if I'm going crazy or not, although my mom assures me I'm not. ive been getting these weird crying attacks for the past year, just once a month during pms.  I would cry hysterically for 30 minutes and then would be so tired I'd need a nap.   But for the past month they've been about every other day - and sometimes daily.   They come on like a panic attack......I get a twinge of burning heat in my upper back and then watch out - I'm in a fetal position balling and making almost primal noises.   Once that 'attack' is over a lot of times I'll start crying again because the attack was so bad.   While I'm crying I physically can't stop it and I really feel like any moment something inside me is going to snap and I'll go insane.    After all all this I'm literally too tired to do a damn thing and I just end up on the couch.    Im soooo tired of this!!!  I have a drs appt next week to see about antidepressants and I'm hoping that will help. has anyone ever had. Anything like this happen?   Can crying for hours a day actually be 'normal'? thanks so much for your feedback and any advise ! tracy"

I also have a burning mouth and tongue. My tongue is tingling to. I have loud tinnitus with it. I havent slept for 3 nights running now. When I lye down my nose throbs and I don't know how to help the pain. Also my jaw is weak and hurts and I find it hard to chew. My dentist was concerned and referred me to a maxofacial specialist who I see Wednesday. My nose will go red as the day goes on. I know burning mouth syndrome is related to menopause but this seems extreme. My teeth hurt but my oral health is good. When I eat certain texture foods it's hard to swallow it.

sharon7362,2015-01-19T17:56+00:00,Endometrial Atrophy,"Hello Ladies, I wonder if anyone has been diagnosed with endometrial atrophy.  I am 52 and post menopause.  After 14 months without periods, I bled fairly lightly for about 5 days in December 2013.  I went straight to the doctors and was sent to gynaecologist for scans and biopsy.  All came back normal.  11 months later, November 2014 it happened again, but this time was like a full on period.  On both occasions I had sore breasts etc beforehand and the hot flushes disappeared.  Again, just before Christmas I went back to the gynaecologist and again repeated scans and biopsy.  This time they diagnosed Endometrial atrophy as the lining was very thin.  There was nothing nasty, no lumps or fibroids etc and the lining was normal, just very thin.  The gynaecologist prescribed Vagifem pessaries for 6 months to put a coating on the lining as she said it was due to low oestrogen.  I really didn't want to go down the route of HRT as I am a bit nervous of it, so decided not to use the pessaries as the bleeding had cleared up.  However, I now am bleeding again and so I guess I don't have much choice but to try the pessaries.  I know there is a lot less risk with them as they are not systemic.  I have had a white discharge too for a few months and my GP took a swab last week to rule out any infection.  I was just waiting for that to come back before I started to use the pessaries, but began bleeding a couple of days ago.  I have read that when the lining is very thin it can become ulcerated and presumably that's why it bleeds.  Has anyone experienced endometrial atrophy on here, and if so, was you prescribed the pessaries and did they work?"

alesa17269,2016-11-03T17:16+00:00,Aniexty or peri menopausal,Hi. I'm new to this and really need some advice and support. Out of the blue this year I became very anxious and like I was withdrawing from my love ones. I think it felt like depersonalisation. I went to the doctors and they put me on medication and I got better so I thought. It comes and goes in waves sometimes i feel that I'm living  on my nerves it's so hard especially when I'm a mother and a wife and juggling everything. We sometimes have to be super women. It is so nice when i don't have it as there are times when I'm ok. At the age of 39 the doctor told me that I wasn't on the the change but after 5 months of being fine then not I was so fed up the doctors (I saw 5 different ones and each time up my medication) finally listened and put me on hrt after doing a examination the doctor finally agreed there might be a chance I was in the early change I Thought it was working until last week when I have had another spell of it! I have had 5 since March this year. I Went back to doctors where I no longer feel I can see her and I feel that she is fed up with me and not sure what to do next as I feel I'm wasting her time. Does anyone else feel like this as it feel so frustrating as aniexty and depression comes hand in hand with being peri menopausal and really some reassurance and guidance. Alesa xxxxxxx

My belly is throbbing tonite, fast heartbeats, not a good day at all! Anxiety just doesnt want to shift! Very down and low in spirits. I called chemist who made my BHRT tabs asked about side effects, he didnt think internal tremors were a usually reported as such. He suggested i stop them for three days to see if they improve. He didnt know internal tremors were common in menopause! I nearly suggested he come visit this forum for better information.

IM 46 this month and I have had my hormones checked twice over the last six months and The doctors keep telling me they are ""fine"". If they are fine then why do I feel insane? I have experieinced Vertigo, nausia, headaches and migrains, anxiety, sleep disterbances (feeling like im not sleeping well and some nights waking multiple times), digestive issues of all sorts, severe anger!, I work hard to keep my mouth shut because I often feel like I shouldnt be this angry over most things, Crying a great deal, blurry vision that comes and goes, not being able to concentrate or remember what I have just read (I'm a student of Phychology) although Im typically a great student the last 18 months I feel like a total idiot not being able to recall words or ideas, small areas of transient hot spots, thinning hair and hair falling out....again!, bad taste in my mouth, feeling detached from loved ones or apathetic about participating in day to day activities with people, numbness or tingling, feeling disconected or like im viewing life as a dream, vaginal odor that comes and goes with no discharge or itchy even though im a super clean freak, constant sinus pain and drainage with persisitnt throat clearing, I had two episodes of what I believed as well as the parametics was a heart attack but after being hospitalized and extensive testing there was no evidence at all of any cardiac issues, feeling too cold sometimes even when others say it feel fine, feeling tired and lethargic often and not able to complete physical tasks that I had been able to do two years ago with no problems. I was a fire fighter for ten years and finally decided I couldnt keep up any more so quit that job and went back to school to become a Phychologist. I feel like Im going insane but given my studies I dont fall into any ""crazy"" catigories. So here is what tests have been done and the findings: CT Scan normal (outside of a small fattly deposit not affecting any surrounding objects in the optic chiasm) We have known this was here for many years and it remains unchanged. This CT was done to find out why all the sinus issues and headaches that seem to be located in the sinus areas of my face and forehead. Nothing of interest noted! MRI: same findings, Nothing of interest noted. Extensive eye exam: nothing noted outside of general changes due to aging and possibly allergies. Extensive Phyciatric testing and two years of follow on counseling: nothing noted outside of anxiety and mild depresssion due to unresoved medical fears. Dr. continues to see me at my request and not because she thinks I have unresolved issues. Allergy testing and shots to ""fix"" the allergies that were cusing the sinus issues and visual problems. Didnt help either. Hormone levels checked twice and advised that they are all in normal range. I have a refferal to neurology with no appointment schedualed yet, still waiting Appointment schedualed with ENT next week to check sinus issues. Final comment on all of this. I began taking an over the counter estrogen suppliment about six weeks agao and my migrians, vertigo and nausia went mostly away. I forgot to take them for three days and they started to come back and once back on them they have been mostly gone since. It doesnt seem to help any opf the other problems though but if my hormones are normal then why does this help any at all? So the big question if you have stuck with me and read this far is: are any of my symptoms not something that others are experienceing? Does anyone see anything that they think I need to address as outside of the possibility of peri? Do you see any thing that I am experienceing that you think isnt peri related? I feel like I should be instatutionalized some days. PLEASE, please comment if you have any advice at all!!!"

I've been to the ER more than four time in a month. The cardiologists did stress test and othe rtests say it's anxiety or stress. I have no energy. mMy energy is up and down.

Julie7070,2016-10-28T14:20+00:00,"Anxiety is so bad, I feel like I am going mad!","Hi, I have been perimenopausal for 6 years now (since I was 39) back then i was having very long heavy periods and then missing a period on occassional months so my GP send me for a blood test which confirmed my hormone levels had dropped so I was entering the change a little early.  At the time I was on citalopram anti depressant which i had been taking for many years.  Then just over a year a go i had to come off of the citalopram due to it causing me a heart problem which is very rare but once off of the citalopram my heart went back to normal. 3 months after finishing the citalopram i started getting very tearful, dizzy and hot flushes. At the time i thought i was getting depressed again, but my GP said that the citalopram had been helping with the symptoms of perimenopause. My situation at the moment is that I am unable to take any antidepressants as I cant get on with any of them and the 2 i did get on well with made the heart condition return!  So now I am scared to take any medication. The last 6 months i have been suffering with terrible anxiety which has got so bad I have lost my job due to it.  Heart palps, feeling like I am going mad, sense of doom or dread, hot flashes, then feeling chilled to the bone like I am going down with flu, my joints ache and crying for no reason or for silly reasons, oh and dizzyness and ringing in my ears.  I've had 3 periods in the last year.  I also have no sex drive.  Can anyone relate to these symptoms and are they all down to menopause??  I have had bloods tests all come back normal apart from the hormone fluctuation, I'm waiting to get the results back for a 24 hours ecg check on my heart and the MRI scan i had last year came back normal ( i had the MRI done on my head due to the intense dizziness i was feeling.  I am taking a multi vitamin and a natural form of HRT.  Any advise or help would be welcome, especially on the crippling anxiety which is the worst for me at the moment.  Much love to all of the women going through this at the moment!!"

Mind you, this one isn't particularly heavy, but it is dragging on...and I'm having very annoying physical symptoms along with it (dizziness/lightheadedness, muscle aches, headache, feeling just generally ill)....and I've been crying at the drop of a hat (of course, that could be because I'm so frustrated by all of this).....I find myself getting increasingly anxious about all these symptoms, and I despair of ever feeling well again. I am taking supplements, but I'm not certain they're helping, and I'm trying to exercise as much as I'm able because I know that will help....but how do you exercise when you feel so dizzy and detached from your body?

My question is for those of you who use progesterone, either cream or pill, and stop it the week you bleed. Do you feel like you wish you can start it back up earlier? My bleeding is less than a week. And the instructions say to start it back up on the 8th day of cycle. But my symptoms came back after about 5 days off of the cream and I just can't stand it so I started it up again today even though I'm still spotting.

I have a vitamin D deficiency and was told my immune system was overactive and was put on medication to balance this. Sorry for waffling on so much. I went online for a solution and read the upper ear was related to the hormones. Was just wondering did anyone else have this symptom or maybe it was something else? xxxx

My periods have started to space out to about every three months so I just pray my days of ups and downs are close to being over.  Being hit with this at anytime of the year is horrific but so much worse over Christmas and New Year. I'm so lucky to have a very supportive husband who has been my rock.  It hasnt all been doom and gloom but when it hits you again and again you lose all your confidence and just go into yourself.  I have found it hard over the past 10 years to make really strong friendships as I can't trust what this body is going to do. (i know you can all relate to that)   I rather keep to myself when I'm like this as I don't have to explain myself.  After 10-12 long years I have given up on trying new things and have decided to just tough it out to the end.  Please give me the extra strength I need to get through this. I wouldn't wish this on anyone.  Love, health and happiness to everyone and I pray that all your troubled days are over soon.   My sister went through the same thing and when her periods finished she didn't have any more dips.  She is my inspiration!!!!  There is hope for us all!!!  xxxxxxxxxxxx"

When I heard women complaining about their horrible symptoms, I used to think they were crazy and needed to get a life. I never thought the day would come, that I would be in their shoes now. Live and learn. This experienced has taught me to at least have compassion for people when they tell me their troubles. You never when the shoe will be on the othet foot."

elaine62759,2016-10-17T21:04+00:00,Burning Mouth Syndrome?,Hi I'm going through the dreaded menopause and last year developed dry eyes. Now I seem to have a problem with a dry mouth and sore tongue. My tongue feels like a piece of sandpaper and sometimes feels sore as if it has been burnt. My doctor has been no help at all and my dentist has now suggested that I might have burning mouth syndrome. Does anyone else have anything similar? Can anyone suggest what food or drink would help or be avoided? Is there anything else that might help? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
pippygirl,2016-10-19T00:10+00:00,nausea in peri and menopause,"i'm 55 and haven't had children (polycystic) but have had nausea and dizziness for years.  it's such a drag!!  this is my first month where i have not had a period (i thought they'd never stop) and i have gotten so ill with what feels like a stomach/gut issue.  so i've gone dairy/gluten/meat free and am eating really, really healthily.  i wish i could say it was helping - i would like to think that i'm not making it worse.  for the nausea, can i suggest what sounds like capital punishment - raw ginger.  awful but it does actually help.  and interestingly, it will help with the dizziness because it has asprin like qualities that work well for dizzy/balance problems.  one other thing to try is 'yoga yawns'.  go to yawn but don't.  hear the creaking going on in your head?  that's your eustasion tubes (inner ear).  these are flexing and clearing when they creak.  do this as often as you like and it will help some of you for sure.  it's just so rough though, i shake my fist in the air and yell 'next time i want a penis!' - chances are i'll get one growing in the middle of my forehead....back to the ginger.... i take heart that many of you write that it gets better, that it evens out....."

misty36246,2016-10-18T02:59+00:00,HRT,The pain has gotten worse with stomach problems on a daily basis with muscle pain in the middle of the chest and breast pain. I ache all over. Three years of this discomfort I'm finally thinking about going to another GYN who will listen. The discomfort is debilitating feel like I'm having a heart attack I've had upper GI ekgs and an ultrasound all negative for cardiac problems. It's gotten frustrating. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms and what did you do I'm willing to try anything
MoonLeaf,2016-10-18T02:35+00:00,Methyl Folate,"Hey ladies, how much B12 should a woman (say ""44"" years of age) take, and how much D3 and do you have to take Calcium with D3. Also, my Doctor has prescribed me L- Methylfolate (a pharmaceutical grade nutrient, right?). Has anyone had any experience with this? And lastly, to anyone suffering from insomnia, Melatonin is so worth your time and effort to see if it works for you. I take 5mg at night on nights where I can't sleep, and it does the trick. If I take 2-5mg pills, I'm a little groggy the next day, but if the insomnia is severe enough 2-5mg is the max I have to go with Melatonin. I was shocked when I tried it and it worked for me. I thought, here, after all these years, I've heard so much about it but never tried it, I had actually even tried other sleep aids, and this--as a natural supplement--has worked wonders for me, especially during PMS(DD), when insomnia hits like a MAC truck. If you haven't ready any of my posts prior to this, I believe that I am in Perimenopause. I am scheduled to see a BHRT Specialist very soon. I live in a small town, so I had to do plenty of research and have had to wait a little longer than probably most would have to in a larger city. At any rate, Perimenopausal Insomnia has become an issue from time-to-time and the Melatonin is a godsend. So, give it a try if you're struggling. If we don't get our rest, nothing will repair itself and we'll continue to feel run down, not ourselves, so don't forget how important your rest is. As well as remaining hydrated. I have returned to drinking plenty of water throughout my days. I like to infuse it with fresh orange/lemon slices, mint and ginger, it breaks up the monotony and just tastes great! It took me a long time to admit to myself that, I do believe, I'm in Perimenopuase (which you can remain in for up to 10 years before entering Menopause!). After I began doing research, I finally started to figure out that everything I've been dealing with seemed related, and ""a-ha,"" the light bulb sort of just went off one day. Honestly, feels like the day I turned ""44,"" I went ... you know, I think there's something to this. I'm interested in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (because I don't believe my hormones have EVER been balanced, I feel as if this is the crux of my issues, entirely), and it is because of my research and my interest in BHRT, that I am set to see a BHRT Specialist. I'm not messing around with this quick-to-anger strange personality that comes over me, or this ""blah-mood,"" that bleakons everything in my day, or this anxietythat crawls out of nowhere, or the iriitability that sneaks up on me. I feel like a raging bitch most the time. And a weeping willow at other times. Like I said, if this can last up to 10 years (I think I've already suffered a few years in), then I just can't ... I need to believe there's hope, and more answers in Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy.  Sending you all positive vibes, hoping your worries and woes are worked out, and SOON! Peace. MoonLeaf ~ ;-)"

Dazednconfused,2016-10-16T07:58+00:00,Disheartened,"My closest friend has just basically told me to get a grip. We are of a similar age (46) and she says I'm the only women in our age group, including herself, she knows who is ' suffering' with bad peri/meno symptoms. Apparently everyone else is doing great and getting on with it. I now feel like she sees me as a complainer and weak. The thing is I don't personally know any women who are having it bad (which is good thing - I wouldn't wish it on anyone) so maybe I am just one of the unlucky few or I am a complainer and weak. Who knows, all I do know is the brain fog, dizziness, nausea, neck aches, headaches, extreme fatigue, hair loss etc etc is very real, if only to me. Sorry to babble on, but feeling sad and a bit alone right now. If your female friends can't sympathise it's a lonely old place to be. But hey, reading all your posts on here helps tremendously - l don't know how I'd cope without this place. Thank you all for your posts and I wish you all as smooth and symptom free transition as possible. Every day is a day towards getting to the other side! Happy Sunday! Love and best wishes Dazed xx"

I feel anxious about my life, lost virtually all of my coping mechanisms, feel angry and otherwise like a lump of concrete some days where feeling anything at all seems impossible. I can't talk to my husband and he's lost for words watching me sit feeling desperately empty and crying. Worst thing is my kids don't deserve a mum like this and these days are coming indiscriminately and without warning.

My doctor does feel I am in perimenopause - for the last couple of weeks I've been a walking hot flash, plus I have the mood swings of my worst version of PMS... I actually quit my gynecologist in a huff because her assistant was maddening on the phone. I work from home, fortunately, in a high pressure position, and am barely able to keep it together right now. I just started Pro Gest cream and am hoping for a good result.  Basically though I'm shocked at these emotional issues I'm having. I've never been a shrinking violet, for sure, but I feel like a walking ball of rage. Please tell me this gets better...(I know it's all individual) I have almost quit my job via phone so many times in the last couple of weeks I can't even tell you. Perimenopause for me seems to magnify my emotional reaction/response to a situation that really is negative, but can be reasoned through under other circumstances.

No cramping or pain either.  Then low and behold, 6 days post op, I had bright red bleeding the size of a candy bar on my pad.  Happened just once and the rest of the day and night, I had nothing.  Then today, it happened again, but the amount was more like a half dollar size...and nothing since.  I have been doing light housework, laundry, and carrying groceries.  Could that cause these spurts of bleeding?  Is it anything I should be concerned about?  I see my doctor for follow-up next Wednesday.

GP has prescribed Premique 0.625mg/5mg tablets but with no discussion, I knew I wanted to start continuous combined HRT but wasn't given any options on brands/choice/dosage - has anyone had any experiences with this HRT or any side effects? All my other bloods are normal so it's not linked to any other conditions & looks like definitely menopause. My tiredness, insomnia, flushes & night sweats are ruining my life at the moment - I need relief & want to know if this HRT is going to help as I can't go through another few months of 'trying' something to see if it helps."

My period is still regular but mostly over and done within a day, for the last 6 months I have experienced extended periods of moodiness, breast tenderness that can last for weeks, nausea not related to anything I have eaten, muscle aches which seems to be better now but the most annoying symptom is the feeling that just underneath my skin I feel tender, almost like a bruise.  This feeling is mainly on the outside back of my arms and occasionaly on areas of my legs. To describe it better, it's not my muscle or my skin but seems to be the area between my muscle and skin if that makes sense.  I've been to see my doctor who  has run a series of tests and apparently I am very healthy and has put these symptoms down to hormonal changes. I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced the tender body feeling and have you found anything to hep relieve it? Thanks"

Maestra,2016-09-22T23:25+00:00,Blood Pressure,"Heavy bleeding with clots sent me to the doctor.  They found a fibroid and she says that's the cause of the bleeding, but I think it's beginning menopause.  My doctor denies that I can be there becasue my cycles are still regularly happening.  I said this in another thread. Anyway, because I'm over 40, she said the heavy bleeding required an endometrial biopsy.  When I went in on that day, they said my blood pressure was very high  150 over something.  I was pretty sure it was due to the anxiety of everything.  As soon as I turn my car on to the road with the doctors office, I can feel my heart start pounding.  She ended up not being able to do the biopsy because of my anatomy or the fibroid in the way or something.  She gave me a couple of options, one of which was to just wait and see if things got better or worse. The whole thing upset me so much, I decided to just wait and see.  For several months my periods were not that bad.  Still heavy, but not so clotty or so long.  Then this month I started spotting/light bleeding around ovulation and it didn't stop. Then my cycle started, or must have because the bleeding got heavier and clotty again.  It's been several days of heavier than it's been the last few months. I really think it's meno and/or the fibroid, but I'm thinking I should go in for the biopsy just to put my mind to rest.  I called and she gave me some medication to take on the day of the procedure.  Supposedly it loosens things up, but when I looked it up, the effectiveness was kind of in dispute.  I'm not looking forward to going in and having them tell me again that my BP is high.  I bought a home monitor and it's slighly frustrating because sometimes it's up, then if I wait a few minutes, it's normal. Overall when I track it, it seems okay.  I think I have anxiety just over the whole BP issue in addition to the bleeding! Does anyone know if menopause is known to affect blood pressure?  I'm wondering if what I'm seeing real or is it just white coat syndrome."

Whino,2016-10-05T12:32+00:00,Heavy Bleeding After Menopause (With HRT),"I decided to start my own thread rather than keep repeating my story all over the place. I am 53, no periods for a year and a half, until this week. About four and a half months ago, fed up with hot flashes and etcetera, I got on HRT (hormone replacement therapy). I've taken a 1 mg. Estradiol tablet daily since then. It was wonderful and pretty much eliminated all of my awful menopause symptoms. Then, about two weeks ago, my doctor added generic Provera, 2.5 mg. tablet per day. After about ten days, I got lazy and skipped a couple of days of my HRT pills and now I'm on day five of flooding bleeding. I've even considered going to the emergency room a time or two so far. My doctor says I need an ultrasound and a biopsy (which I'll get next week). I am a giant wuss and plan to get some kind of anesthesia or heavy duty prescription pain pill for the biopsy procedure. (If my doctor says no, I plan to get a different doctor). Also, starting today, I'm taking myself off all HRT. Because of my research (googling) and the timing, I believe that in my case the bleeding is most likely because of the HRT (although of course I can't be certain of it). It was lovely to get a break from all those menopause symptoms but it's not worth this. Has anyone else had bleeding after menopause with HRT?"
lori92895,2016-10-08T20:20+00:00,Should I be concerned?,Should I be concerned.  I had spotting with clots which my doctor termed old blood most of August into September.  Then in the middle of September I began my flow.  It won't stop.  It's been three weeks.  Instead of getting lighter it is getting heavier.  I am tired and just want it to stop!!   What should I do??  Should I go see the doctor.  I feel like I should go to the emergency room.  I feel like I'm slowly bleeding to death.  I don't like Perimenopause.

I've also got this buzzing,vibrating sensation all over my body with my heart racing and pressure headaches for months and months.

The first big one that happened was about a year or so ago where it hit me so hard I had to sit on the floor from fear of passing out. Fortunately, my later episodes have not been that severe and they most certainly have lessened in frequency. Seconds only but feels like an eternity lol. The ones I have been having since then have been very mild in comparison and jsut a second or two of a slight ""whoosh"" sensation and then I 've learned to just go on and tell myself its just part of it. Click here to view image So last night, I was going along fine, although I had noticed a heightened sense of energy and slight anxious feelings all day but in a good mood and had just finished dinner, helping my girls with their homework, gettting them ready for bed, took care of feeding the animals, etc... hubby not home yet... went to fix some coffee and felt it coming on .... almost feeling like it did last year where I had to sit down for a few minutes. I drank some water and called my mom who talked me through until I felt better. My legs felt like jelly too. I got hot and started sweating again and turned the air to 66 degrees LOL. However, I did calm down and felt normal again and was able to go about the rest of the evening although it stays in the back of my mind and I wake up this AM wondering if I'm going to have another episode again. Even though I've had these before, it freaks me out every time. And then mommy guilt sets in as I think I should be able to handle anything and be there for them 110%. When I talked to the doctor about it... She's not too concerned about it saying it could be hormonal, silent migraine related, or inner ear related as one time it happened I did have an ear infection.(but I think that was just coincidence) I have noticed a pattern during this journey... most of the time it happens mid cycle or right before my period is due. Doctor said fluctuating hormones can do many weird thigs throughout your body. So I've noticed that at the time estrogen drops at midcycle and then before period is perhaps when this occurs, maybe it drops faster some months than others and that causes the severity of the symptoms?? And then when estrogen is supposed to be rising, I tend to get the migraine starts. Sooooo I was told by others if I noticed a pattern then plan for those days!!! Ex. plan to stay home, don't schedule appts or activities on those days! PROBLEM!!!!  First, I have an 8 year old and 6 year old to take care of. Second, I have a job I can not just skip out on regularly. Third, my cycles range from 24 days, 26 days, some times 30 days since I've started this journey of hellish perimenopause so how can I PLAN?? And the problem we have during this time is that hormones are very erratic so it could happen anytime throughout the month and not just twice a month as I've noticed.

She was also having like a weird occasional feeling in both her arms, she said it didn't feel so much like pain but sort of a weird feeling. ?of course, she was concerned it was heart-related so went to the doctors yesterday, although she was feeling a lot better generally. Apparently the doctor was very thorough and tested her blood pressure and said it was fine and she didn't now what else it could be. She is testing her cholesterol next week too. ?It put my mind at rest a little, but i'm starting to really worry because reading up on women's symptoms on heart probelms is really scary and  it mentions things like pains in both arms which can appear early on before having an attack. ?Although she wasnt feeling good at the weekend, bear in mind I've also come down with a cold and haven't had any energy at the weekend, just not as bad as my mum, so it could be something we both picked up. And in terms of her menopause a lot of this seems to link to it and be symptoms of potential menopause, especially since the doctor said she was fine. However, I'm just curious about the feeling in her arms she gets. she said she thinks it started after we played tennis and golf on holiday about three weeks ago, becuase we don't usually play sports, that may have caused it. ?Basically wondering if any of you lovely ladies would say that you've experienced this?

I have an appointment at the end of next week for a second attempt at a biopsy related to a fibroid diagnosis.

Blessed_Mimi,2014-08-09T03:19+00:00,Relief for Symptoms of PMS and Perimenopause,"Hey ladies! Click here to view image Was doing some research on my symptoms tonight and come across this article. I guess Dr. Phils wife has followed this and feels better at 50 then she did in her 40's. I would love to feel better soon. Has anyone tried this or heard of this regimen?  Flaxseed Oil High in lignans, a natural hormone-balancing substance, flaxseed oil is as effective as hormone replacement therapy in lessening hot flashes and sweating. It's also good for depression and fatigue. — Recommended dosage: 1 to 2 tbsp. a day. An alternative is to buy ground up flaxseed, and sprinkle it on top of your food (such as oatmeal and popcorn). Evening Primrose Oil Helps in relieving breast tenderness, mood swings, anxiety, irritability, headaches and water retention. — Recommended dosage: Two weeks prior to the start of your period, take 1,000 mg a day - half in the morning, half at night - after food. Multi-vitamins and Magnesium Having sufficient amounts of the essential multivitamins listed below, along with magnesium, will help to relieve mood swings, insomnia, anxiety, tissue dryness, and water-retention. Recommended to start with: — Vitamin B complex, 50 - 100 mg a day — Vitamin C, 1000 mg three times a day — Vitamin E, 400 - 1200 iu a day — Magnesium, 500 - 1000 mg before bed Zinc Helps to lower estrogen (too much is as bad as too little) and increase progesterone levels. Also helps to build strong bones and improve your immune system. — Recommended dosage: 15 - 50 mg a day Natural Progesterone Cream This can help in relieving fuzzy thinking, fatigue and fat gain. Rub on your throat, the fleshy areas of the inner arms, and in the palms of your hand. Exercise Work out vigorously for at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week. De-stress Stress amplifies symptoms and causes the body to produce the hormone cortisol. Too much cortisol can cause diabetes and high blood pressure. Stress also zaps the body of essential minerals and vitamins. Adrenal Refresher At times of high stress, replacing lost minerals and vitamins can help the adrenal glands produce less stress hormones. — Recommended: B complex vitamins, Vitamin C, Adrenal Gland Extract, green and yellow vegetables and sea vegetables. Soy Phytoestrogens Soy can help in diminishing the intensity of hot flashes and night sweats. Consume moderate amounts of soy isoflavone supplements"

sharon1984,2016-10-01T23:40+00:00,What is happening to the hair??,"This is just plain horrible, all of it.  I'm  50  years old- as if the last four years were not hard enough- fatigue, achy joints, fibro, weight gain and no energy.  I think this might be one of the hardest things yet - my hair texture and thickness is changing big time.  My asset has always been my hair- thick, soft waves my entire life, (as probably many women).  I think I am having major hormone crashes because the hair is breaking off, falling off and actually looking thin. The hot sweats don't help because I think it is drying it out further.  My hair has gone from healthy, full and wavy to getting scraggly looking and thinner in just a matter of a few months.  Just entered menopause this month because no period for last 12 months.   Ladies, this menopause is unbelieveable-- not only physically but mentally. It is bad enough to not feel good but now I have depression over the condition of the hair, as it drastically affects the way I look.  I guess we end up letting go of everything we had- just so depressing.   I should stop being so vain and think of those losing their hair totally with chemotherapy or other stuff.  At least I have hair. Still...this menopause really strips your life."

Crying, anxiety is dreadful, constant ringing in ears, lightheadedness all the time, acid reflux, mood swings, feeling really sad ....... Went to the docs and they put it down to anxiety.

I am 44 and just missed my period. A period I could count on like the sun raising every month. The sudded heat flash at Bed Bath and beyond and then the freezing chills to the I am going to murder someone in 3 seconds, when 4 seconds ago I was having the best day of my life. The weird tingly tongue and the weight that magically came on around my belly, And let's not forget the entire summer feeling like a small breeze would make my sore nipples feal as if they were going to fall off from the pain. So this is really it! My anxiety which I always had in life has gone from hummm ""I hope I don't run out of gas"" to I am dying completely dying. I have tried to talk to all my friends, some have started missing or irregular or just plain mood swings.But with this anxiety I seem to think all day and all night about it. So tell me all you brave woman fighting this beast they call a woman's rite. What to do next? Other then drugs how do you deal with this anxiety? heat flashes? dread? mouth issues..And it goes on and on! My stress level is beyond and anxiety sky high. I somethings think who will care about sweating when I have full blown heart attack from all this.  Appt with OB next month so I will ease my mind reading your comments and experinces. It is good to know there is an army out there and there is this site. I have read everything and anything about perimenopause!"

Periods are now 4/5 monthly and very light when previously very heavy. I've had hot flushes intermittently too that usually last 2/3 months then go and then come back again and feel nauseous alot/mood swings etc. I take Black Coosh which helped at first but think it nowit doesnt. New symptoms I'm experiencing is feeling weird, hot, but not flushing, weird feeling in feet and legs, achy back and a fussy head, think the anxiety is now creeping in too as am getting tearful, which really isnt like me, and like others have said am thinking there is something seriously wrong with me and that it just cant be menopause that is making me feel so crap. I've been to GP and am awaiting results of blood tests. I usually do alot of exercise but I worried to do this at the moment as I feel so weird. I've asked for HRT prevously but they are reluctant to give it to me because of the side effects. Thiis page has helped me to see what works for others and that Im not alone in feeling like this."

I have been to see the long standing nurse practitioner of my GP surgery today. She listened and listened, questioned me to find things out, took into consideration my family history and then said yeah I think you're peri menopausal, she has took loads of blood and is getting EVERYTHING checked from my hormone levels, estrogen, to my thyroid and rheumatoid arthritis along with all the normal checks of organ functions. Finally feel like I'm getting somewhere. My rib pain (my worst symptom at the minute)she is checking for inflammation possibly costochrondritis or fibromyalga and says to just take painkillers and use heat pads when necessary and to check in for blood results on Wednesday where we'll discuss further.

graham27298,2016-09-30T10:19+00:00,Could my fiancée be in peri menopause ? Any advice appreciated,"Dear all, I have been very worried of late about changes in my fiancée.  She turned 40 a few months ago. She's gone from utterly sweet, devoted and loving to cold, hostile and easily provoked. She's become paranoid too, accusing me of controlling her, of not being good for her (when all she could say in the past was I was the best thing that ever happened to her). She recently hasn't called me for 10 days and when she did reappear she was cold, indifferent and complaining.  I don't recognise her anymore. She was so affectionate and sweet, now she's hard as nails. I have been in agony feeling so estranged from her, as I love her so much and thought we were soul mates.  My mind has run the gamut from is she depressed to is she seeing someone else, but somehow these don't convince.  She's literally turned into another person, and when I found an article on peri menopause I started to wonder... She has a history of gynaecological problems so she could be a candidate for getting it early.  When we we on holiday in July she was complaining about fatigue all the time, like even if she had 10 hours sleep she didn't feel she had rested.  She also started getting problems with her nails, sore gums, various little symptoms which I didn't realise were common in the menopause.   Does anyone believe this is plausible ?  The trouble is how can I broach the subject without upsetting her even more?  Does she even know the effect this is having on my mental wellbeing ?  Thanks for reading.  Bless you."
HopeAgain,2016-09-24T03:51+00:00,Can sex be good after menopause with no HRT??,I went through a nightmare of perimenopause. Panic attacks and a terrible loss of feeling in the vagina. I lost my libido which was horrible because I've been married for 31 years and we always had a great sex life and the last 2 years have been horrible. Not due to pain but due to the panic attacks and lack of feeling in the vaginal area. My question is....can you NOT take HRT and still enjoy a great sex life? Is the feeling still really good?? Does it take forever to get aroused? If you don't take it does your vagina stay dry forever? I guess I want to know if eventually it all works out and you gain your libido again and the lubrication. If you have tried any method of HRT or not let me know what worked for you please! I also want to know the difference you might have noticed with oral HRT or just the vaginal creams. I want my sex life back!

My usual HRT wasn't available earlier this year and the alternative made me bleed, my GP gave me Livial but by then (April) I had decided to go cold turkey and stop so didn't take it, I notice that since April my skin has really dried and looks wrinkly, libido decreased, and I am getting hot flushes again although not too bad, no energy and a bit emotional. I am thinking of going onto Livial/Tibolone but want to know if everyone gains weight and if the benefits outweigh the risks. Would love to hear from others to help me make up my mind.

Eveything was good except for my estrogen leavel was very high at 388 and I am 54 so it should be in the double digits or less. Dr. did another test it came back at 285. So I had transviginal ultersound that showed a cyst on the right ovary a utrine polyp and fiborids and my utrine linning was at 12 mm. So my dr. sent to a gynoecologist. He did another ulter sound everthing was the same so he did a endometrial biopsy no cancer and he did one more ultersound the other one done about a month agos. I have not had a period in three months, I know tha I am in perimenopause from the blood work. I feel like I am starting my period with cramps and it even feels like I am flowing but nothing or it like water. I am bloating all the time. I get what feels like a pulled muscel on my upper thigh and gorain arera. I go back to my regular doc. to go over what the gynecolgist. When I talked to the gyno. He advised me of three opitions-Waite and see if the cyst and poloys go away but I still have the fiborids to deal with.2-Hystercopy to get rid of the cyst and polyp 3- Hysterectomy. Any ideas of why no periods? I do not if it is part of the peimenopaue or the cyst or polyps. Have a good day"

Jaxywaxy,2016-09-28T17:14+00:00,Vaginal tightness with menopause,I have been perscribed vaginal tablets Vagifem which I insert daily.  Although it helps a bit with some symptoms I am still unable to have penetrating sex with my partner. I want to go to doctor but I find it difficult to discuss because she is so young.  I am due another smear test and am terrified to go because of the use of the instrument they use would cause me to split.  I am wondering about pushing to go on to full HRT to solve this issue. I am 53. I exercise regularly and consider myself healthy although probably drink too much wine. Any suggestions would be gratefully received.

I would just go to bed because I couldn't stand myself. I also have a 6 year old, GOD Bless him he sees mommy in these terrible stages since birth. Lately I feel lifeless, lack any drive, my mind feels crazy or a sense of dread, trapped in my body and wondering wear thereal Kim is. I decided to look up menopause, since I haven't had a period in about 6 months. From reading other stories don't feel so crazy, but I am going to see what my doctor can give me. Being female right now sucks, I don't know this woman I see in the mirror, the words I say can be so hurtful. Thanks to all who have shared"

I exercise 6 times a week - not just walking but high intensity interval training and weights. I have been on tibolone for 2 weeks and have already put on 1 kilo. The benefits of tibolone for me are no more hot flushes, improved sleep, my old happy self back again, increased energy, less fatigue and no more foggy brain. In other words, it's made a huge difference to the quality of my life. For all those benefits, I'm willing to put up with a few kilos weight gain, but does anyone know how many more kilos I can expect to put on?"

I have noticed that it happens mid cycle as well as right before my period most of the times ... but it doesn't happen always. I am on Effexor as well for anxiety and thought maybe it could be the med too. Idk.. it's just a weird strange feeling that makes me sometimes grasp hold of something .

This medicine is estrogen based.  I'm only on 25mg, but since taking it I am more tearful, more anxious and my pmt is a lot worse.  I've been having peri symptoms for a few years.  I don't know if it's the spironolactone, or if that is a coincidence and it's hormonal. I just think if spiro is estrogen based I should be feeling better not worse??  I also have ?Endometriosis and M.E/EDS. My last cycle was 38 days, but haven't really been keeping a track of it before then, although generally around 28 days."
hannah11786,2016-09-25T21:29+00:00,Estriol cream.,"Hi. Ive been suffering for a few months now with feeling dry down below and stinging when i pee. Its been such a rollercoaster ride for me being in and out of the doctors trying to get to the bottom of finding out what the problem is. Ive had swabs, blood tests, urine samples.. antibiotics (many courses) and all came back clear etc. Its only when i moved from home to a different town with my partner, registisering at the doctors here they told me its a UTI and that im lack of oestrogen. Ive been prescribed estriol cream with the applicator using twice a day for 2 weeks then after that once a night for 2 weeks. Im hoping this works for me as this problem has been brimming my self asteem down for a while now, the pain is sometimes unbearable and VERY uncomfortable. It lasts a little while then can go for days or even over a month then just hit me hard unexpectedly. :-( as of my age 23 i wouldnt of expected to experience something like this. Totally oblivious to these kind of problems. I wouldnt wish this on anybody and for all of you in this forum i hope it works a treat too."

Maestra,2016-09-26T03:39+00:00,Came close to public embarassment today,"I am on what I think is day 10 of my period.  It could be more because I've had little spurts almost each day since I ovulated this month, but counting from the heavier bleeding, I think it's day ten.   Yesterday, it seemed to be finished.  I went out and ran in the morning and had only brownish/dark red spotting through the day.  It was stickier, like it was just the leftover stuff. Today we had theatre tickets.  Just as I was getting ready, I felt a rush of blood and there was some new bleeding, so I put in a heavier pad just in case.  During the play's intermission, I had some clots, but not much bleeding.  Then at the very end as I stood up for the ovation, I could feel the rush of bleeding/clots.  I had to be rude and dodge around older people with canes and walkers and of course I was at the furthest point from the bathrooms in the theater!  There was a whole rain of clots and I'd absolutely flooded the pad.  I think if I'd let it go any longer, I would have had a stain on my dress or the chair or just had it running down my legs. I think that's one of my biggest fears.  I can deal with the pain, but I'm very afraid of being at work (I'm a teacher and can't run out of the room) or in public and having a serious situation.  I'm seriously considering purchasing dark seatcovers since my car's upholstery is light grey!"

My heart goes out to all of you going through the anxiety/panic/low mood stage. 9 solid months of anxiety and panic and low mood. This stopped me from going anywhere and I definitely could never plan anything. I didn't want to do anything. I left my job last January as I couldn't cope. 9 months on things have improved a bit. I started a new job last week part time and I absolutely love it. Been out and about with my kids and husband and have been fine. I'm looking forward now where as before I didn't want the next day to come. I still have chronic headaches but have been told today that I'm having a mri scan of head and neck at last! Some of you know I am on HRT and it looks like it could be starting to work after adjusting it although not so good on the days of progesterone. It has taken months to accept that going through menopause is a natural thing and accept the really horrible days as there is only so much you can do. Eating properly and exercising as much as you can even if you just walk for 5 mins. It is hard to do but you can do it! Hugs everyone x

I have been having perimenopause symptoms for several years and periods have been getting heavier and heavier with clots and closer together. This last one 10 days ago was 4 days late which is very unusual. And now this. I don't know if this is going to turn into a period or what. I know I have read on here that other women have had erratic cycles. I guess I am just looking for some reassurance."

I find that, at times, my vision seems off or slightly out of focus. I find myself wanting to rub my eyes to see if that clears it up. It will be like this for one or two days and then will be ok for a week or two until it happens again. Had my eyes checked a year ago and am due again for routine check but worry that if appointment occurs while vision is off my lens prescription will be wrong. Has anyone else noticed this? Thanks☺"

beckbjj,2016-09-17T20:21+00:00,Anyone have experience w/ continuous birth control (oral) & menopause?,"I turned 49 in July, and have been on continuous (no placebos ever) oral contraceptives since 2001.  I've had occasional spotting over the 15 years, but very rarely.  I have no idea if the pills have spared me most perimenopause symptoms or if I'm just not there yet.  However, since June I've had bleeding (bright red ""new"" blood rather than dark ""old"" blood, and heavy for me but I think about average for most) about 1/3 to 1/2 of the time.  I've also had that kinda pulling, crampy, heavy feeling along with the bleeding.  It's becoming quite annoying given that I'm not sure why it's happening. Does anyone have experiece with continuous birth control and menopause?  Does this seem like a normal occurrence for someone who's been on continuous birth control very long term and who is now approaching permenopause/menopause?   Advice appreciated!"

Perhaps this group is even better, since it appears to be people futher along the process than I. I am 44 and over the last year and a half have had heavy periods, clotting, shorter cycles and a lot of anxiety.  I was diagnosed with a fibroid, so I know that is the cause of some problems, but I think I am also in perimenopause.  It's hard to tell because many symptoms are the same.  My doctor said it's not peri until you skip periods, but some of the info I've found on the we disagrees with that and says the periods closer together are a sign."

I am on citalopram , an anti depressant following a severe bout of depression , anxiety and grief following my mums death last year . This really has been my year of hell and I was hoping that I was gradually coming out of it . I had so many tests . I've never been to the doctors so much , even when I was pregnant . Before that I hadn't really been to the doctors for years . Sorry for waffling . The thing is as soon as I get an ache or pain I think the worst . Previously I was convinced that I had stomach cancer , as I've had lots of issues with appetite and sicky feelings . All this came about since losing my mum . Now this sends me into meltdown and I don't want to be in that place again and the constant health worries . Does anyone know where I'm coming from ? I hate all this .

Guest,2016-09-12T23:41+00:00,Walnuts ----> Help with pain & depression!,"Just thought I would share this because we all suffer from hormonal depression & pains!  The following are my top 10 reasons to eat raw walnuts: 1. Walnuts are great for joints. They provide lubrication and cushioning. 2. Ever notice that a walnut looks like the two hemispheres of the brain? Well it just so happens they were made that way for good reason; they are excellent for cognitive function and memory support. Research also shows that walnuts can improve depression. 3. They are rich in polyunsaturated fats, which lower bad cholesterol while keeping good cholesterol intact. Walnuts also lower blood pressure. Between these two benefits, walnuts may reduce your risk of heart disease. 4. Walnuts are anti-inflammatory. This provides benefits to anyone with chronic pain, such as those suffering from arthritis or fibromialgia. 5. Research has shown that walnuts help prevent breast cancer and slow tumor growth. 6. Walnuts contain the highest levels of popyphenolic antioxidants of any edible nut, making it a fierce free-radical scavenger.  7. Walnuts help keep your skin and hair healthy and prevents dryness. 8. Men: super-charge your fertility. Two handfuls of walnuts per day have been shown to increase the motility, vitality, and morphology of sperm. 9. Eat walnuts, lose weight. The fat, protein, and fiber of walnuts contribute to a sense of satiety, reducing your urge to snack on junk food. The fats found in walnuts have been shown to assist the body in using fat stores as an energy source. And when you get the good fats in your diet, you’ll find that you are not craving bad fats quite as much, such as potato chips or fried foods. 10. The healing properties of walnuts are so powerful that the FDA is currently trying to get walnuts listed as a drug. I kid you not! I couldn’t make this up! Read more about these recent shenanigans here: FDA Says Walnuts are Drugs"

Having been on HRT for 16 years I didn't expect to have to go through menopause as I have no ovaries. However I came off the oestrogen HRT 18 months ago and I was and still am awful. Hot sweats all the time - I can have a shower go to dry my hair and by the time I've finished my head is soaking wet - mainly scalp, forehead under my eyes and the sweat drips down my face. If I do anything even try to iron or Hoover the same happens. The doctor thought it was excessive sweating and put me on Clonidine 100mg X 3 daily - they have helped a little but I'm to embarrassed to leave the house and with any exertion it still happens. I'm home 24/7 I also suffer with odema in my legs from knee down and my feet/ankles swell badly - I did see a GP over this and they gave me water tablets but they didn't help.

After 5 months on that, started up the spotting/bleeding again.  Doing a hysteroscopy and D and C on October 6.  Doctor wants to look for polyps.  I am still concerned about how often and how long I bleed.  I may go several months or weeks with nothing and then it just appears.  Hangs on for a couple of weeks mostly spotting, sometimes more like a light to moderate period.  I know I have asked before, but if you have had experience with polyps, please tell me all you can about your experience.  My last bleed/spotting was just a month ago and lasted two weeks.  Now I am doing it again!  The constant bleeding plays with my mind as though there is something terribly wrong. In addition, I sometimes feel crampy as well.   Please, anyone else like this?

Guest,2016-09-01T21:25+00:00,total hysterectomy..Mayo Clinic,"Are Pap tests still needed after removal of the uterus (hysterectomy)?Answers from Sandhya Pruthi, M.D.It depends. A Pap test, also called a Pap smear, is a routine screening test for early diagnosis of cervical cancer. If you had a partial hysterectomy — when the uterus is removed but the lower end of the uterus (cervix) remains — your health care provider will likely recommend continued Pap tests. Similarly, if you had a partial hysterectomy or a total hysterectomy — when both the uterus and cervix are removed — for a cancerous or precancerous condition, regular Pap tests are still recommended as an early detection tool to monitor for a new cancer or precancerous change. You can stop having Pap tests, however, if you had a total hysterectomy for a noncancerous condition. Your age matters, too. If you're unsure whether you still need Pap tests, discuss with your doctor what's best for you. My sister thinks she does'nt ever have to be checked down there since her total hysterectomy after reading this I guess she's right since she did not have any precancer only fibroids. This stuff is so confusing"

A transvaginal ultrasound is a type of pelvic ultrasound used by doctors to examine female reproductive organs. This includes the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, cervix, and vagina. “Transvaginal” means “through the vagina.” Is the vagina also called ""vulvu"" and if there is something wrong with vagina  would it show up a transvaginal ultra sound? Do gyn when given pap smears do they normaly look at opening for anything looking suspicious? When doing pap smears and biopspies can they see if anything is wrong with vulva or is that a special test?

Last week I visited the GP and had a blood test which I have to wait a week for the results. The thing is I've had no symptoms of menopause ! Oh except for painful finger joints and back ache etc. So can this be menopause ? X"

A recent blood test showed that my hormones are very depleted and so I have started HRT as of 2 weeks ago. I am still waiting to feel some difference...For those of you who are taking HRT how long did it take before you started to feel better?

When I take the utrogestan I feel odd,all wired up. I read on other forums that instead of taking it orally a lot of ladies use it vaginally. I don't think it is licensed in the UK. I spoke to my doctor today and asked her. She hadn't really heard about it but said for me to find out more. I wondered how other people have got on with it orally and vaginally?"

menopolized,2016-09-05T14:55+00:00,Worst batch of symtoms,"Hi again girls ! Ive come to experience almost all symtoms of menopause. But they come in batches...some disappear for some time...reappear with vengeance. At one particular phase which set of symptoms have been the worst torture for you ? For me the stomach problems like fast motility of food in food pipe ( dumping ) causes hypoglycemia so i have to eat frequently ( maximum 2 hours gap) so at night i have to keep food near the bed. But for fasting blood sugar test we need at least 8 to 12  hours gap after last meal at night. So I can never get a reading for fasting because i never fast !! and The last reading i had was indicative of the possibility that I might have diabetes at this particular time of life. Then again this trap Ive fallen in right now - the coughing bouts trigger bladder problems...everytime I cough i pee in spurts so have to wear under garments accordingly and be careful i dont eat food that may cause cough. I dont know which batch of symtoms is worse. I also suffer from tremours, nausea etc etc Please share your worse set of symtoms at any particular time."

When I do finally fall asleep, I seem to wake up every 2 hours with a feeling of dread. Not too mention the strange dreams I been having since menopause. Has anyone experienced, or is experiencing this strange issue? Before menopause my sleep was always restful. Now I am lucky if I get 4 to 5 hours of sleep now. Someone on this site told me about lavender oil. Put a few drops of lavender oil on my pillow at night. It is supposed to help you sleep. I will definitely read up on it, and purchase a bottle. It can't hurt."

bri1206,2016-09-03T19:15+00:00,Am stunned,"Ladies-- I am 51 and am less than 2 weeks away from the official one year of no periods--experiencing hot flashes, night sweats and chills, insomnia, and mood issues. I have a history of ""manageable"" back issues for years due to car accidents. These issues have increased and now know I have severe spinal stenosis at C4-C5, small herniated disc at L4-L5, and facet joint degeneration at L4-S1--all of which are being addressed via pain mgt. I thought the facet joint hip and butt burning were unbearable.....until I suddenly started having HORRENDOUS joint pain everywhere. It has been debilitating and I have been truly frantic about what is happening. Then I came across this website and literally cried and laughed (not that any of this is funny). Admittedly, I have been a bit clueless about the totality of menopause. I was STUNNED to read all of these posts--so many of the responses could have been written by me. I promptly made an appt with my nurse practitioner and saw her yesterday. I love her and she patiently listened to my tearful story. We did blood work to rule out auto immune issues and she was both validating and reassuring during our HRT discussion as the possible next step. She prescribed a non-steroid anti-inflammatory and it has only been 24 hours and I feel some much grateful relief. Clearly I have other issues going on with my back and have an appt with my pain management doctor on Friday. He is not yet aware of this new joint pain but will find out. I trust him and he is awesome, but let's face it.....he is a guy. No offense to the males in this world, but he will not get what I am experiencing despite his care and concern. I am finally feeling some hope of pulling things together for an overall treatment plan to get my life back. THANK YOU to each of you for sharing your stories. I wish all the very best and will continue to follow this discussion!"

sentoholistics,2016-08-15T16:05+00:00,Hysteroscopy concern,"I have to have a hysteroscopy on 2 Septermber to take biopsies to check I dont have endometrial cancer.  I had a hysteroscopy in July 2015 as I had a thickened lining and a polyp. The polyp was removed and biopsies were taken which came back as all clear. At the time I was having heavy periods and a lot of pain, but mostly normal cycles. I was in perimenopause and sometimes my cycles were longer and sometimes shorter. I had one period in the April that dragged on for nearly a month but was very light most of the time.  After the hysteroscopy the pain subsided and I had 3 normal periods. I then started my November period as expected but it was extremely light and would disappear for a couple of days and then come back and then disappear again. This carried on for a few weeks until towards the end of December when I had very heavy bleeding and clots for a while. I continued bleeding until end January when I stopped for a week. A Vaginal Ultrasound at the beginning of Jan showed thickened lining still. I then bled for three weeks in February, three weeks in March, one week of brown spotting in April, bled for the whole of May, three weeks of no bleeding and then bled for the whole of July. One week of no bleeding and then I'm bleeding through and still today.  I am beside myself with worry that the hysteroscopy is going to show cancer because of this abnormal bleeding. The GP had wanted me to have the coil but I refused and it wasnt until May that they referred me to gynae - only getting an appointment last week with a consultant.  I asked the consultant if it was cancer and becasue I had been bleeding so much since Dec, would that mean the cancer would likely by now have spread outside and she obviously couldnt answer that.  By the way I am 49."

CCinCal,2016-07-21T21:22+00:00,"""Victories in Self-Compassion/Self-Care/Self-Nurturing""","Hi ladies, I was reading a few posts and saw a theme about wanting to be more self caring and self loving towards ourselves. And I thought maybe we can share what we've done to be more gentler to ourselves. I remember over a decade ago a friend made the comment that I was so hard on myself. It took me by surprise and actually I had no idea what she even meant. Since then I've realized that I'm what you'd call a perfectionist. And now going through peri, perfectionism and being hard on myself is really working against me. So I thought maybe we can share on what one or two things that we've done daily to be more self compassionate with ourselves. I can start. I woke up late today. 11:30 am. I always put myself down when I wake up late. Thinking other people are at work, I've wasted half a day. I'm lazy etc. Today I followed those thoughts with compassion for myself 1. I'm still recovering from surgery so I can give myself a break, listen to my body and give it what it needs 2. I don't have any place to be today so it's OK. 3. I'm sure there's others in their pj's at that time. Anyone else being nice to themselves today? ??"

Instead of thinking I can't do anything to change what is happening to my mind and body, I want to start changing what I can and close the book on these last seven months of ongoing health issues.

natacha66,2016-08-28T06:06+00:00,A great read,"Ladies. A very good friend of mine sent me his uncle's book about menopause. He is a very reputed gynaecologist in Paris and his book has been translated in many languages. It tell women in details what to expect for the next 30 yrs after becoming perimenopausal. I though I'd share it with you all and shed a glimmer of hope in this journey of night sweats, hot flashes/flushes, uncontrollable tears, fears, anxiety, weight gain, pains and strains, etc... It called: THE MENOPAUSE and it is written by Doctor Jean Pierre Naccache. Hope it will help. Xxx"

My Dr. sent me for a colonoscopy, as everyone should have one from age 50 in any case. I am phobic about all these screenings... All was fine. Then he sent me to the gynie, who did a smear, an internal vaginal ultrasound and sent me for an external lower abdomen organ ultrasound. All was fine other than a small fibroma in my uterus. I was so pleased to be over it all and felt blessed. The gynie also recommended Femarelle pills, all natura,l to stop my sleep issues and hot flashes. After a week I felt results-amazing. Then during the second week, I got premenstrual symptoms- tender breasts/nipples. I haven't had my period for about a year. A few days later, I woke up spotting. Very little. So now I have to go back to my gynie. I am hoping it is just the Femarelle or estrogen waking up after a long nap. Can it be that something changed in less than two months? It seems never ending. Last year I had a biopsy after a mammo found a lump, which was just a fatty lump, but all that stress..."

Guest,2016-08-26T19:34+00:00,"""How should a Christian woman deal with menopause?""","Question: ""How should a Christian woman deal with menopause?"" Answer: Like childbirth, menopause is a unique experience for women. There are no hard and fast rules on how it will affect women, only guidelines. Some women experience menopause very early in life, and others much later. Some women go through menopause with little more than hot flushes or night sweats to deal with. Others turn into mad women with a Jekyll-and-Hyde personality shift. A lot is made of the negative side effects of menopause—graying hair, drying up of natural body secretions, loss of libido, tiredness, waking up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat, or being zapped by hot flushes, usually at the most inconvenient of moments. These flushes are sometimes called “power surges,” but in their wake they leave the poor woman feeling exhausted. With the change in female hormone levels, the urge to have sex diminishes, but this does not mean women go completely off sex. It simply means that affection and tenderness become more important than passion. Let’s be honest; menopause is not a lot of fun! However, it’s not all doom, gloom, and despondency. Although the process can take years, it does end. Post-menopausal women emerge stronger and often more assured and content. Like puberty, menopause is a transition, a biological change. Although change is always a challenge, the Christian woman can turn to God’s Word for wisdom to help her and her family to get through it. Because the Christian woman is not self-centered but God-centered, she can take comfort in the knowledge that it is who we are on the inside that matters to God, and not what we look like on the outside. “Charm is deceptive, and beauty is fleeting; but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised” (Proverbs 31:30). The aging process, including menopause, is not to be feared, and we have the assurance that God’s grace is sufficient to get us through whatever life throws at us: “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9). The Christian woman can be assured that God will never leave her or forsake her (Hebrews 13:5). The godly woman will take her anxieties and fears to the Lord in prayer, seeking His guidance, His wisdom, and His strength in order to overcome. “Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you” (1 Peter 5:7). If she is married, the Christian woman will also confide in her husband and communicate as best she can why she might be behaving erratically or why she doesn’t seem able to cope. Husbands are not mind readers, and they generally find it easier to deal with domestic situations when they know what the problem is. Communication between husband and wife is never to be underestimated. When asked for his help and understanding, no Christian husband can refuse! In God’s arrangement, husbands are to love their wives and to cherish them (Ephesians 5:25). As Matthew Henry observed, “It has been said that Eve was not taken from Adam’s head to lord it over him, nor from his feet to be trodden underfoot, but from his side to be equal with him and from under his arm to be protected by him.” As his wife goes through the transition of menopause, a godly husband will make it his business to encourage her. He will show patience when emotions run high and his wife behaves strangely. He will be there for her to give reassurance and comfort. Instead of worrying, the couple will present their petitions to the Lord in prayer, confident in receiving divine help: “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:6–7). The promise of Hebrews 4:16 is for all of us, women going through menopause not excepted: “Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.” The Christian woman who is going through menopause does not need to feel helpless or alone. We are known intimately by God, and He cares for us. “If you make the Most High your dwelling—even the Lord, who is my refuge—then no harm will befall you, no disaster will come near your tent. For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways” (Psalm 91:9–11). This is God’s promise to all who love Him. Let Him be your refuge and your strength. And take comfort in knowing that this, too, will pass."

paisleygirl,2016-08-19T19:09+00:00,Post Menopausal and Symptoms back with a vegeance,Hi all I am new here and am so glad to find this forum it brings me some comfort to read that I am not alone. I am 60 years old and have been post menopausal for 9 years now. I had the perimenopause from hell and thought that once I became post menopausal it would end ...unfortunately it didn't. I have done well over these last years with only occasional bouts of anxiety and of course hot flushes and gastro intestinal issues. I just turned sixty in July and these last few weeks my menopause symptoms have come back with a vengeance the anxiety is ruthless I feel like I must have every dreaded disease going which is ridiculous I know in my heart I am extemely healthy. The hot flushes are to the extreme and the shakiness and ringing in my ears is on and off. I feel like my face is on fire at times with the flushes. I am also experiencing muscle spasms in my back I guess due to the anxiety.  I am trying to console myself with the fact that maybe this is the last big bang before everything settles down for good but have read that some women experience some of these symptoms well into their mid sixties or longer. I don't want to go back onto anxiety meds so I am looking for any suggestions on what to take that is natural for not only the anxiety but also the extreme flushes. I can deal with the inside shakiness that is only fleeting and few and far between but this anxiety and flushes has to go I can't believe I am dealing with all this once again. Any input would be much appreciated

Im on school holidays, but a holiday is far from how it feels with a hyperactive non compliant child, I dread this time of the year. Period several weeks late and def not pregnant, feel like im going to get a period I have all the symptoms and the pain but it doesnt come, im bloated constantly and moody constantly it doesnt end.

jayneejay,2014-10-10T13:30+00:00,Menopause - Bladder- Flushes-Migraines-Post Menopause Bleeding ..Useful Info..,"Menopause Menopause signals a change in women's health needs. To address these changing needs, a woman needs to first understand the facts. Technically, menopause marks the time when the level of estrogen produced by a woman's body gradually declines. The symptoms of estrogen loss may include hot flashes, insomnia, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, urinary incontinence, and vaginal dryness. Over time, the loss of estrogen in the body can also lead to an increased risk of diseases such as osteoporosis. Supplements for this must be concidered .. During menopause, the body makes less of the female hormones, estrogen and progesterone. Some women may experience troublesome symptoms such as hot flashes (a sudden flush or warmth, often followed by sweating) and sleep problems at this time. Sometimes, women have other physical problems such as vaginal dryness. While many women have little or no trouble with menopause, others have moderate to severe discomfort. Here are some of the most common health topics relating to menopause. Signs and symptoms of natural menopause *Hot flashes: why they happen? *Bladder health during menopause *Migraines and menopause *Postmenopausal Bleeding *Blood tests to check hormone status Signs and symptoms of natural menopause As a woman’s body prepares for menopause, there is a gradual change in her menstrual cycles over several years. This is called peri-menopause and it means “around the time” of menopause. Menstrual cycles may become longer, even heavier, with occasional missed periods, and fewer days of flow or lighter flow. Women often experience flushing spells or hot flashes, night sweats, during this period. The degree to which these flashes make a woman uncomfortable is unique to the individual. Some women have intense experiences, while others have minimal physical discomfort.  Other signs and symptoms of natural menopause include: vaginal dryness, night sweats, thinning bones, decreases in the level of heart-protecting high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and rises in the level of harmful low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Along with hot flashes, there may be some sleep disturbances. Changes in sleep patterns can be very disconcerting and challenging to one’s emotional health. When sleep is significantly interrupted, women may experience increased “blues” or anxious feelings. Similar to adolescence, pregnancy and the postpartum period when the body is adapting to changing levels of hormones, it affects our emotions. Emotions are an expression of how we are experiencing the environment – changes in our hormones, change how we feel. This stage of life, like all the others, has its challenges and opportunities. For many women, mid-life is the first time they’re able to focus attention on their health, career, hobbies, home, recreation and romance. While there is great reward, mid-life may also be the time when you are caring for elderly parents and family members or when your children are leaving home. These are new stresses and new experiences and you need to prepare yourself. Hot flashes: why they happen? Hot flashes, the most common of menopausal symptoms, are sudden feelings of heat that spread over the body, often accompanied by a flushed face and sweating. A Hot Flash is the way our bodies naturally cool down, during menopause . During a hot flash, which typically lasts from 1 to 5 minutes, the heart beats faster and blood vessels dilate causing a flush. Women may also sweat or suffer a wave of anxiety, body perspiration may smell stronger, become excessive, also underarm perspiration may become bothersome, when in stressful situations and increased anxiety.  In the not-too-distant past, a woman was told that hot flashes were ""all in her head.” We now know that these uncomfortable waves of heat are the body’s response to declining estrogen. What is still uncertain is why hot flashes last only a few months for some women, and persist for years or never occur at all for others. Some women may experience night sweats, a drenching sweat that can often disrupt sleep. While these symptoms are disruptive, they’re usually temporary. Treatments are available to help alleviate these symptoms. Bladder health during menopause Women going through menopause can experience a number of physical changes, some of which can contribute to irritation of the bladder or bladder control problems. Among these changes are: weakening of the pelvic floor muscles, which makes it difficult to prevent urine leaks caused by coughing, sneezing or lifting heavy objects thinning of the lining of the bladder and urethra, which can lead to more frequent trips to the bathroom (frequency) or unusually urgent needs to urinate (urgency) ( overactive bladder ) . decreased responsiveness of the bladder and urethra to nerves and hormones, which can make it difficult to control the urge to urinate. These changes are present in all women going through menopause and are responsible for many of the bladder control problems and urine leaks that some middle-aged and older women experience. If you have had multiple pregnancies or difficulties with bladder control in the past, you are more likely to experience bladder control problems during or after menopause. If you are having bladder control problems as you go through menopause, there are a number of treatments available to help. These therapies include prescription medicines and pelvic floor muscle exercises such as Kegels. Even if you think that your bladder control problems are due to menopausal changes, you should discuss them with your physician or clinician. A medical evaluation will determine if these changes are being caused by another condition, such as an infection, heart problems, medicines, or nerve damage due to diabetes or stroke. It is important to take care of yourself and stay in control with sensible diet habits (limit your caffeine intake and eat plenty of fiber) and by retraining your bladder to hold more urine (for example, try to train yourself to only go to the bathroom once every three hours). Urinary tract changes As estrogen levels decline during midlife, several body systems are affected including the urinary system. The lining of the bladder responds to lower estrogen levels by becoming thinner and more easily irritated. This means that some women will experience problems with bladder infections or other urinary symptoms.  During menopause, there is an increased chance of vaginal and urinary tract infections. ( Bacterial Vaginosis & Yeast Infections) If symptoms such as painful or overly frequent urination occur, consult with your physician or clinician. Infections are easily treated with antibiotics, but tend to come back in certain individuals. To help prevent these infections, urinate before and after intercourse, be sure your bladder is not full for long periods of time, drink plenty of fluids, and keep your genital area clean. Douching is not thought to be effective in preventing vaginal and urinary infections. Migraines and Menopause The prevalence of migraine is 2-3 times higher in women than in men. The character of the headaches also differs between the sexes. Women tend to report higher levels of pain, longer duration of headaches, and more associated symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting. Visual symptoms are also less common in women. There is a long recognized association between ovarian hormones and migraine. Over half the women who experience migraine report an association between their headaches and their menstrual cycle. The frequency and severity of migraine is increased commonly with the use of oral contraceptive pills and during menopause. Because migraine is affected by hormonal fluctuation, estrogen use during the premenstrual period is sometimes helpful. However, ironically, estrogen may also trigger migraines. Women should discuss with their physicians the use of estrogen such as oral contraceptives and hormonal therapy for migraines. Stress often triggers migraines, so women who are habitual sufferers should learn relaxation and stress management techniques. These are especially helpful in aborting headaches when warning signs are felt. Massage as well as relaxation exercises of the neck, shoulder, and jaw muscles may all be helpful. Rest in a dark room with cool compresses can prevent the headache. Foods such as alcohol, aged cheeses, chocolate, fermented or marinated foods, MSG, artificial sweeteners such as aspartame, and caffeine all may trigger headaches; diet should be monitored to reduce or eliminate intake of these. Nicotine may cause migraine — yet another good reason to give up smoking! In summary, each woman's migraine pain, her triggers, and her ""headache calendar"" (when headaches tend to occur) are unique. Treatments are also unique for each case. To properly plan treatment, individual triggers, lifestyle issues, stress levels, eating habits, and willingness to accept drug therapy, must be considered. Women with moderate migraines may need prescription drugs for relief. These could include agents that affect neurotransmitters (the chemicals that are the messengers in the brain) such as sumatriptan and various antidepressants. Other drugs might include agents that dilate (widen) the blood vessels in the brain. In some cases, painkillers are prescribed. Postmenopausal bleeding Postmenopausal bleeding is characterized by any vaginal bleeding after you have become menopausal, generally defined as having been without a period for 1 or more years.   This is not uncommon, occurring in 30% of post menopausal women, however no matter how light the bleeding is, you should always see a gynecologist if you develop any postmenopausal bleeding.  The most common cause of postmenopausal bleeding is that the lining of the uterus or vagina may be inflamed, causing sloughing, and superficial ulcerations that lead to bleeding.  Other benign causes include the presence of a cervical polyp, or overgrowths in the lining of the uterus.  There is always a risk of cancer in the cervix or lining of the uterus, which is why it is so important not to delay seeing a gynecologist if you develop postmenopausal bleeding. Evaluations of postmenopausal bleeding include an examination and often an ultrasound.  Additional testing may include a biopsy of the endometrial lining, a hysteroscopy to take a close look at the uterus and D&C. Treatment for postmenopausal bleeding will be based on findings from the evaluation and often times includes topical hormone replacement, D&C or in few instances, even hysterectomy. Blood tests to check hormone status A blood test is sometimes done to check hormone status in perimenopausal women. This test measures the level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH.) The problem with interpreting this test, in women approaching midlife, is that one measurement doesn’t provide enough information. Perimenopause is a time of hormone fluctuation. You may find that your periods are irregular or changed in amount of flow or duration compared to earlier years. Some menstrual cycles are anovulatory (without ovulation). These changes in hormone levels may actually vary significantly from one week to the next. So if a blood test shows a normal FSH, it doesn’t mean that that it was normal 5 days earlier, or that it will be normal 5 days later. To accurately predict how the levels of FSH correlate to a woman’s peri- menopausal status, in early perimenopause this result often comes back as normal as the hormones are too erractic to test in early perimenopause. One signal that the midlife change is complete is when FSH levels are above 40 mIU per milliliter on two separate occasions, measured 1 week apart."
Guest,2016-08-19T21:09+00:00,I got my results today,"For those that have been following me know what all I have been through for  the last 2 months and half of tormenting fear! This nightmare started June 2, 2016 when I woke up at 59 years old (post menopause ) blood gushing out of me after NO period for 19 months which was only spotting for 7 days and then 9 months later June 2, 2016 I woke up bleeding so heavy I had to be rushed to ER thought I was hemmorraging!  After test ran and a transvaginal ultra sound which showed 9mm lining thickness I was told I had to have a uterus bisopy done.  I just got my results all back today NO CANCER!  NO hyperplasia either! They said my results was perfect! BUT heres the kicker the blood work showed that I am NOT menopause after 19 months of no periods! She said that I am peri-menopause at 59 years old! Said I may have a few more years yet before menopause. She said the body dont know those months of the usual 12 months that says you are menopause. She said I may even ovulate again! They canceled my next appointment which was in two weeks said just come back next year for your regular appointmen! I thank God for my awesome report! I thank all of you ladies for your prayers!"

gailannie,2016-08-17T18:27+00:00,"Needing help, stopping HRT","Ladies I really need the experience of this group.   I had a horrible time in perimenopause in my mid 40s.  I tried HRT to attempt to resolves the problems.  The HRT was worse than the symptoms.  After trying for two years, I finally gave up, and went back to using nothing.  Continued through menopause in the next 10 years, but  it was a breeze.  Years into menopause I developed vaginal atrophy and dryness, and that's where I drew the line in the sand. My OB gave me vaginal Estrace.  I didn't like how I felt when I put it in, so I used it ver infrequently.  The atrophy and dryness continued, and got worse.   So like it or not, I started using the vaginal estrogen regularly.  All of a sudden it was like my entire body sprang back.  Slept great, felt great, energy and mood like I was 30.  But then my scalp started itching and my hair started falling out big time.  A dermotologist told me it was the Estrace, and to stop using it.   Fast forward through seeing a dozen different doctors and specialists.  I worked with a ""hormone"" expert endocrinologist, who charged ""cash only"" through the roof.  Patiently hoping this woman would be able to help.  But must admit the side effects of the estradiol patch and progesterone were miserable.  Finally, when she thought by looking at labs that I was adjusted....I QUIT her practice.  If this was ""adjusted"" this woman is crazy.   So with that background, can someone, any one, please give me your experience coming off hormones.  It seems that everything has changed.  My skin is saggy and baggy.  My hair is completely brittle, and my nails are the same.  I get strange pinging sensations throughout my limbs.  None of this is fun.  It sure seems that the hormones would have left my body quite some time ago.  Is my body now trying to adjust?  And how does this take?  Will I ever simply feel normal again?   Love to hear what other woman have experienced when they dumped the bioidentical hormones.  Thanks for your time."

The twitching and muscle jerks have lessened a lot. Trying to eat some bananas? lol. Not sure if that helped. Anyway, I always have some degree of health anxiety. I take an antidepressant and Ativan if it is really bad. This morning a friend of mine called me to check on me bc she said I wasn't acting like myself last time she saw me. Well, anxiety immediately went up, my appetite went out the window and I wanted to cry. I have dr appt on Friday to go over routine lab work, and now I'm scared he is going to find something wrong.

mary27160,2016-08-17T13:21+00:00,Vaginal atrophy,"I know I have vaginal atrophy.  I'm using vagifem regularly but even with additional lubrication penetrative sex hurts.  It hurts enough for me to want to give up sex altogether.  I'm only 55 and don't want to do this, but I don't want to continue with this pain (like pulling off a plaster on a hairy limb).  My gynea wants me to have a vulva biopsy but I've turned this down since I don't have any swellings, or problems outside my vagina.  I've heard of the mona lisa treatment and wonder if this might be an option for me.  Is there anything else I can try.  I've also read I should do sex more frequently to 'ease the pain' but that just seems mediaeval and sexist.  I'm due to finish my tamoxifen in 13 months time.  Do you think this atrophy will clear up after that?"

patty818,2016-08-16T19:33+00:00,"Hot flash, night sweat and chills questions","Hi Ladies: I have a few questions about hot flashes and night sweats.  I'm 54 and been post meno since 2012.  My hot flashes have been much worse over the past year.  I also have generalized anxiety and health anxiety, am hypothyroid and over the past year have been diagnosed with migraine associated vertigo (MAV) its a dizziness that comes with headaches and without, but the dizzy part is mostly constant.  I think having MAV in the past year has made my life much worse, because i never believed them when they told me that was what it was, I alway thougtht its my heart or something they were missing and when the dizzieness is bad my anxiety is off the charts.  When i went thru peri meno my anxiety and panic was all day everyday.   To the the hot flash stuff, I have them every day and at night I can't sleep well because one minute i'm so hot and throwing off the sheets then the next i'm shivering and freezing, lately I've been waking up with my clothes soaked and my hair wet.  Sometimes before a hot flash I will have chills, do any of you have this?  I feel hot all the time, is this normal with menopause?  I know the weather here in Florida is not helping its so hot and humid.  Its funny at night when I put on my pj's which are shorts and a tank top set, I am could and put a rob over me will watching t.v, but as soon as I get in bed, the heat starts.  During the day I have flashes and I get soaked, I can wiped of my forhead and my hand is soaked, between my breasts and my back.  Does all this sound normal? I don't take HRT,have tried and I can't.  I take xanax when I need it for my dizziness and anxiety and of course my thyroid meds.   Sometime i""m just miserable and depressed, since all this started when I was 46 and went thru peri i felt bad, but now I thought 4 yrs of no period and all this would be about gone.  But the gyno says it can gon on for up to 20 years..  I just want to feel well.  I know my anxiety plays a big part because I worry about health and every symptom I have is a death sentence sometimes.  Like today I felt like a pressure inmy cchest before the hot flash and I freaked.   Also do you find your hot flashes seem to last for a while? Any help would be so much appreciated. Thanks"

Hot flushes (flashes to you folks in the US) and running to the loo (bladder spasms) are bad enough but I've also been diagnosed with A F and had big problems with that, now under control with meds thankfully.  Can't take HRT (family breast cancer issues) and nothing else really helped..given up caffeine and just have an odd glass of wine...you all know the problems, don't want to whine on about them! The thing is, we know there are dozens of different symptoms the Meno. can inflict upon us but I didn't expect still to have them at my age....has anyone else had a Menopause lasting as long as this??"

I became concerned a little as to why it wouldn't stop, then out of the blue it sped up so fast and hard. Bp went sky high and at one point the heart rate was so fast, the bp machine couldn't detect the bp. Heart rate on phone app detected 238 once and the rest of the readings were 160. Pretty scary time. Once I got a bp it was 201/ 118. I of course took a xanax and the bp pill as it was about 3 hours from being time to take it, layed down and about an hour later normal again. Bp 128/78 and heart rate 69. Crazy stuff!!"

DearDoe,2016-08-07T12:51+00:00,5 am and Flooding....,"5 am and I have just slipped back into bed. Here is my story, can anyone relate? I wake up to the sensation of flooding and realize I better get my arse headed to the bathroom. I jump out of bed only to realize that the blood is running down both legs as well as sizable clots and that I am gonna leave a trail that I am going to have to come back and clean up. All this happens in seconds, and before i can even get moving, a massive Charley horse hits me in the back of my right thigh and leaves me cussing like I am in a scene from the exorcist. Finally it subsides and I run to the bathroom, kicking something laying in the hall floor and ripping my little toenail off. Great, more blood loss. I make it to the bathroom, clean myself up (no small feat) and change clothes and then begin the clean up of the trail and bed. Finally, I crawl back into bed, knowing I have this to look forward to again. The hubby is snoring peacefully. At least the dog missed me. Lol. It used to be 7 or 8 days of heavy period, light clots and lots of cramping. For my entire life......in knew what to expect. Now I'm know what to expect...7 to 8 days, but 2 of them I will be unable to leave the house due to the tidal wave of blood and clots that are huge. The rest of the time its pretty light. Oh well. At least the cramps are gone and the crippling anxiety is getting better. Phew! Lol Anybody else experiencing the flooding and clots? Been doing this about a year. I am 45 and been in perimenopause i would say for about 5 years. Still have regular periods, they have just changed. So flat I started taking iron pills, they have been a lifesaver.

Beckyboop,2016-08-04T07:32+00:00,Hopefully help people,"Hello Ladies, I am just off 57 years old and have been experiencing menopause symptoms for several years, heavy bleeding, migraines etc. I was fine for years on the Dianette pill, but my doctor insisted I come off and go onto the mini pill. I did this and straight away I started to experience peri-menopause symptoms. I was told to keep taking a break to see if my periods had stopped . Once I took a break about 3 years ago, I went into full blown menopause. My doctor decided that 52 was the age I should accept that the menopause is something all women should go through, it's life! Male doctor I should add! He wouldn't prescribe HRT because my mother died of Cancer which started off as breast Cancer. Anyway, what a time it has been but, now at nearly 57, I am through the worst as I took natural medication and suffered like hell. I live in Italy so the summers were even worse. My periods stopped over 2 years ago, so I am post-menopausal and don't look too bad considering I haven't had a face-lift... Which I would if I had the money! My symptoms - no sleep, hot flushes, huge hair loss, acne, constant bladder infections, on-start of Oesteoporosis (mum had it), dry skin, constantly needing a wee which is not always possible so I have a love for hiding in bushes etc. I know I can't share medication that helped for me, but I am happy to inbox anyone. I did try HRT after becoming desperate, I demanded it and was given Angelique here in Italy, I signed a disclaimer form, it did not suit me, I only lasted 10 days, i started to bleed again, had stomach cramps, constant headaches, dry itchy skin etc. I feel better now, if you are on HRT, whatever age you stop, you go through it all again. My hot flushes are controlled, my hair is now healthy and shiny, my skin is nice without using over-prised products, I walk every day and take calcium supplements, I didn't take black cohosh because I was told, long-term, they can effect your liver. I still go to the loo a lot, but not as bad, I take a very few sleeping drops to make me sleep, the recommended dose is 20-25, I take just 8 along with .25 Xanax. I only suffer from depression now if something is bothering me which in my case, I have family problems but, I have a very supportive husband. I can't share brands but, I take calcium, cod liver oil, hair tablets, sleeping drops/half Xanax and a fab product that stopped my flushes. My skin is now better as is my hair. I have lines like anyone else, but learnt the art of applying make-up which I only really do if going out. I always wear eye-liner and lipstick. There is light at the end of the tunnel, if you take HRT, you just prolong it, but I would have done if I found a suitable one. Plus I am skinnier"
Melanie0680,2016-08-10T18:27+00:00,Normal or not?,"I am 47, soon to be 48 in Novemeber. I have had normal periods my whole life. Usualy tender breasts a couple days before it starts and usually a stomach ache the day before and the day of on the bad days. I usually have a day and half of bad flow and seven days total time length in my cycle and usually on time. The last few months I have been spotting a bit in between cycles then in July it never would stop all the way but 3 days then it started again light for two days then this past three days it's been really heavy, more than normal and witht the stomach cramps. Not severe but I know they are there. I am not feeling any anxiety other than not knwoing what is going on. Does this sound familiar to any of you? i keep waiting to see if things go back to normal before I panic but it is getting harder to do that. My Vitamin D levels are at 65 so that is good. Been taking more B vitamins and iron since reading all of your posts."

I have been in peri probably past 6 years but only realised that this was the case about 6 months ago. I am 46. My periods were always fairly regular, in the past year or two much heavier. Recently however, past few months, I seem to start by spotting for about 5 days, it's light and on and off, then it can be fresh blood for half day, then spotting until it gets to regular bleeding, usually 3 days quite heavy and then spotting for a day and that's it. As it happens during the right time of the cycle I am thinking it must be just changing due to hormones, but I don't like the on and off aspect of it. Also previously my period was 4 days now it's extending to 8-9, the interval is also shortening, instead of 26-27 it's now 24-25. Is this normal? Or is it something to worry about?"

tonilynn,2016-08-06T06:27+00:00,I want to be my old self again!!!!,"Peri sucks...How I found out....When I took an ambulance ride to the ER for a bp of 225/125. Body was numb and breathing was abnormal. On the heart floor for 3 days being monitored and bp stayed normal. Was told it was anxiety..One NP told me to get checked for menopause that she was looking in a mirror at herself when she looked at me..So went to my doctor and asked her to check and sure enough my levels showed I was peri and very close to menopause. That was 6 months ago. Since then, I have felt like a ticking time bomb, not knowing what symptom would appear next. I have had: heart palps, pounding, tachycardia 130, feeling like passing out, fluctuating bp from 110/68-170/108 (now on low dose of Norvasc) fluctuating glucose too high to low (no meds) irregular heart beats, off balance, dizzy, ears clicking, shaking internally all the dam time, tingling, headaches, sour stomach, indigestion, nausea, head pressure, electric shocks, left hand numbness, whole body numbness, hot flushes, cold flashes, 1 night sweat, cold hands, and feet, aching joints and muscles to muscle tension especially in shoulder/neck brain fog, difficulty concentrating, dry skin, brittle hair, ANXIETY and PANIC ATTACKS irregular cycles, heavy bleeding about a year ago, now spotting to light stomach feels full from a small meal, but brain says I'm still hungary severe fatigue Insomnia bad I could go on...but I have felt like this has taken over me and I cant control it... I am a nurse and normally energetic and now I cant hardly go anymore. I have become homebound most of the time because I just dont know what and when a symptom will flare up as it is quiet embarrassing in front of people to feel so bad you check to see if the bp is and glucose is ok all the time. I have to eat every two hours to keep glucose from going to low. This has been a nightmare!!!!!!!!!! Thank God, I have a wonderful husband that tolerates and understands me during all this due to my bad mood swings and irritability. I have had no treatment during all this. I can say that some things are better or less severe, so I am praying that the worse is ending and things are leveling out. I still have cycles but they are light to spotting. I did go 7 months 2 years ago without a cycle then it returned the 8th month..Uggghhh. Has anyone else gone through this this severe?"

david99999,2016-07-27T08:22+00:00,Fiancee has gone of sex due to menopause symptoms - not sure what to do?,"Hi There I am a 40 year old healthy male and i have been with my finacee for a year and a half, our 1st year was amazing and since the start of this year she started getting loads of illnesses and have supported her through these, our sex life was always problematic, i have a higher libido than her and it has always caused tension but we decided at the beginning of the year that scheduling it was the best option to relieve tension between us and it helped for a while but over the last few months she has been struggling with menopause symptoms and has been ill a lot and the times she has not been ill she is not in the mood, she has been having irregular periods and generally really distance with me, we have good communication and she has said to me that it is nothing personal and she still finds me attractive but her symptoms are making her agitated and uncomfortable and she has to put our sex life on the back burner until she gets these symptoms under control, she also suffers from depression and was on fluxetine for 15 years and this also did not help her libido but we went to the doctors together and it was decided she try coming off them which she did, she has been off them for 3 months now and has not had any depression come back apart from the odd down days, ever since she has come off them she has been different and emotionally distant, she says its not the depression but its the menopause symptoms, am trying really hard not to take it personally and she assures me its not me and she loves me very much and is still attracted to me and wants us to have a healthy sex life but she has put it on hold now indefinitely until she finds a solution, she recently has blood tests taken and they have highlighted she is in premenopause stage, she has the doctors next week to she what can be done and her symptoms can be quite bad and she is not sleeping very well. its been 2 months since we have had sex and am struggling with the lack of intimacy as its a struggle to even get a cuddle out of her or a kiss, i love her so much but am a very emotional person and am finding it very hard to deal with this, have even thought there was a deeper meaning to the lack of intimacy but she assures me there is not, am at my wits end, i have even got the point where i have contemplated leaving but that sounds selfish and unsupportive but we all have emotional needs and i have started feeling anxious all the time now and its getting worse, i bring it up all the time and she tells me she feels pressured, i know she is trying with the doctors to sort it out but am getting to the stage where i don't think things will ever be the same between us, any ideas what i should do, am i being to selfish and impatient?"

I had 35 days without a period and I felt the best but now my period is hear I can feel my mood getting lower again. Does anyone else feel like this during peri and when they get a period?"

My GP recently warned me about stroke risk because of my advanced age (69) & I cut down to 1/2 a tablet (1.25mg) per day about three months ago. I've now lost about 5kgs in weight.  GP said it's not possible that this has caused my weight loss & sent me for a CT colonography to check for colon cancer.  The result has just come back as non-urgent.  Could this reduced dose of Tibalone have caused the weight loss after all?

sophie83338,2016-05-07T21:46+00:00,Is this peri menopause?,"Hello- I would very much like some advice. I am 38 years old, and over the last year particularly I seem to have a constant and ever growing list of symptoms, leading to where I am now. initially I started with pains in my stomach, especially around my mid cycle, severe pelvic pain (like my pelvic bone was throbbing with pain), and sore breasts. My periods have got heavier and I was referred to the gynaecologist for tests for endometriosis. The Dr didn't think it was endometriosis and asked me to keep an eye on my symptoms and see them again in 6 months. However, those pains seem to have been replaced with worse ones- particularly palpitations, to the point I ended up in A&E, when I thought I was dying but in fact had a panic attack because of the palps. All ECGs have been normal and my Heart rate and blood pressure is low. Since then I have been told I have iron deficiency anaemia and are on iron tablets while also waiting to see someone at the palpitation clinic. Since having the panic attack I can feel the axiety sweep over me every time I have a palpitation and I hate feeling like this- it makes me feel physically odd, it's the only way I can describe it. Like I'm worried, scared and have a feeling of dread at the same time. Like someone's told me some bad news. I've never had anxiety before and I'm finding t hard to deal with. ive also started having hot flushes (hot face noticeable to other people) and some nights am like a hot water bottle in bed with the skin between my breasts wet through. Anything else?! Oh yes, electric shock feelings up my neck and throat and pains in what feels like the muscles between my ribs on my left hand side. I feel like a hypercondriac.  My question is- how would I know if I'm experiencing perimenopause? Does any of this sound like perimenopause or am I too young?  Or am am actually falling to pieces and/ or going mad?"

At least I can eat again - the indigestion seems to have subsided...wonder what's next...."
Acejohnston,2016-07-30T13:08+00:00,Am I near menopause?,"Am so glad to have found this group! Have been a member of this site since my gallbladder was removed 18 months ago! I'm nearly 45 had my bowel removed at 22 due to ulcerative colitis and had a bag and had it reversed 2 years later. I had good health for 10 years until I got a mirena coil fitted for contraceptive purposes and it caused my hormones to go crazy and bleed for a year and had to have it removed. Unfortunately it triggered my bowel to act up and I was put on steroids for 3 years and ended up in hospital with severe adrenal issues from the steroids. My hormones have not been right since and attended an endocrinologist who put me on dhea as my levels were very low due to the steroids. I felt well for a while and became pregnant and had my son in 2010. Since then I've been having what I now know is perimenopause symptoms. Headaches, horrendous bone pain, night sweats, hot flushes,nausea, middle of night waking and my periods coming every 21-25 days. I developed gallstones and had my gallbladder removed only to get much worse and spent last year vomiting on and off with horrendous nausea and diarrhea. I then found out I had a 9cm cyst on my ovary that was there in 2014 when they found the gallstone but forgot to tell me. They said surgery was too risky due to my history so I went to an acupuncturist who for the first time explained to me what was happening to my body and how all these things were connected to a hormone imbalance. Like many here my gynaecologist, GP and surgeon fobbed me off and actually told me it was a rare side effect of having my gallbladder removed! I took some herbs and milk thistle as recommended by the acupuncturist and I started to feel better so much so that I stopped taking them 8 weeks later and within 6 weeks all my Symptoms came back. I went to a second gynaecologist who told me the cyst was making me sick. I started researching it and asked my GP to check my progesterone and estrogen levels as well as other hormones. My progesterone was on the floor and my estrogen was low too but the gynaecologist wasn't concerned and I had the cyst aspired but still felt unwell and the acupuncturist put me on other herbs which helped somewhat. I decided then to go to a clinic specialising in hormone and fertility issues and they recommended b complex and a hormone saliva test over a full cycle. I stopped the herbs and supplements when doing the test and started feeling unwell again from mid cycle and my period didn't come until day 38! This has happened a few times in the last 9 months. I've also had brown spotting midcycle on a few occasions for a day. However on day 13 of this cycle the brown spotting started followed by bleeding a few days later. This is still happening 8 days later now and I have a horrendous headache and dizzyness and nausea. I got the results of my saliva tests the other day and my progesterone is very low as is my testosterone and my estrogen was erratic low and then on one or 2 days high. On the peak days both progesterone and estrogen were low. They said I didn't ovulate but am still producing estrogen but in spurts. They recommended I get my GP to test my fsh levels as they think I'm near menopause now. They recommended dietary changes a few months ago which have helped the night sweats and flushes and I'm back taking the b complex which helps with the insomnia. I also take tumeric, fish oil, vit d, magnesium oil, vit c, probiotics and Manuka honey. My diarrhea thankfully settled down and I now get constipated which is very unusual with only having the small bowel. The clinic said they will recommended either black cohosh or Agnus castus based on my blood results although my fsh levels were OK in January I'm not sure if it's a reliable test. I'm so annoyed at my endocrinologist in particular as it turns out he never checked my estrogen and progesterone levels in the 8 years I attended him. I'm just wondering about this bleeding I'm getting now and if anyone can shed any light and also is there a light at the end of the tunnel? The anxiety I experienced last year in Particular was frightening and I've never suffered from it in my life and of course my GP wanted me to take anti depressants! Can anyone recommend something natural that helped them? Maca gave me really high blood pressure and anything that's a stimulant doesn't agree with me. I am praying that this won't go on for much longer. Sorry for the very long post. Tia"
beebop,2016-07-30T16:06+00:00,Is this menapause?,"Started with 4 visits to the ER this week.  I am 47, a bit overweight, and smoke less than 1/2 a pack a day.  I am on NO medications and do not take any kind of drugs, recreational or street.  No family history of heart issues, diabetes, cholesterol, etc.  BP is always fine, cholesterol is a bit hight...240-260 range.  First trip was due to chest pain but only felt it with deep breraths, it was not constant.  I have also been having discomfort in my left arm (for about 2 months) which I think the best way to describe it is overuse of the muscle.  I also had a rspid heartbeat that only lasted maybe 15 seconds and I just felt a little off.  At the ER I had a full work up.  EKG's, blood work that all came back negative for sugar, cardiac enzymes, thyroid, etc.  Chest xray that showed my heart and lungs looked fine.  Also had a CT scan with contracst to check for a blook clot in the lung...negative, also did an US on my left leg as I also had a strange sensation in my thigh that lasted less than a minute.  Negative for a blood clot.  I was not short of breath, just a bit scared.  I am someone who pretty much just has an annual physical.  I do not get sick.  Needless to say I made 3 more trips to the ER.  One doc was thinking anxiety (I am not and have never been an anxious person or depressed).  I had two episodes of catching my breath (tears too!) while waiting for the ambulance.  Blood pressure has always been good, although it did drop at the second ER visit to 110/44 and I started having a sensation high in the chest that I can ony describe as being a bit scared seeing my bp drop making me feel like I might start ""gasping"" for breath.  The doc listened to my lungs/chest and found nothing.  I left and ended up back at the ER that night and the next afternoon due to feeling so exhuasted and just not myself.  I was reassured that all was well.  More blood work, EKG's, all negative.  Saw my PCP, he does not feel it is anxiety, knows that I am not one to go to the doctor due to a sniffle.  I have a stress test set up next week to see if that will revelal anything,  Menopause was mentioned at my ER visits and my PCP feels it may be perimenapause.  I am completely wiped out (although today I am feeling a bit more like myself).  Eating the last few days has been a chore.  I know I need to eat, but geez I really had to make myself eat.  A few times I wanted to just vomit even though I did not feel sick to my stomach.  After much research on line this is what I have found for symptoms that are listed that I have:  My period this month was 2 weeks late (you can set a clock by me..I am NEVER late), for about 2-3 weeks I was having electric shocks, only at work.  Everytime I handed someone paperwork I gave them a shock or it I put my hand on a doorway or door knob, I got a shock.  I also have had 4 UTI's in the last 2-2.5 years (I have only had one prior when I was in my early 30's).  For the most part I am a healthy person as confirmed by the doc.  This has really got me concerned as I know my body, I am never sick, and this really has me concerned.  Is this what some people go through with menopause or perimenapuse?  If this is truly what it is I must say it totally sucks!  I have never been so wiped out before.  Ugh!!!"

I went to my GYN on the 18th..she did an exam and read my monthly diary of symptoms and said it is nothing to worry about..that sometimes it can go longer like this..anyone else had this experience? It worries me, which is another symptom I have..obsessive anxiety. I google my symptoms an have myself convinced I have every disease known to women!! Thankfully I have a patient hubby. <3"

My nail beds feel thin and I cannot get a manicure because the scraping on top gives me pain.  I have to pee more than usual, especially at night.  I feel pressure in my lower abdomen when I am ovulating in the middle of my cycle.  But, I think the worst really is the saddness and down feeling I feel from out of no where.  I actually go from being happy and content to feeling angry, anxiety, frustrated and just plain weepy.  I feel like hopeless and very emotional.  Then it does pass eventually.  I take Xanax for the anxiety and it make me tired feeling.  I feel so alone sometimes even though I have have two great kids and a great husband.  Help I feel terrible right now."

I have found this forum a huge comfort to know I am not alone in this!  Alongside all this my periods have been increasingly erratic being anything from 16 to 40 days apart and lasting from 4 to 12 days. This month though there's a sinister new development in that it started as usual and was done in 4 days flat, but then after 3 days it started up again and is now flowing pretty heavily. I feel really frightened by this as although I've got used the variations in timings and length, this feels wrong and I can't find any examples on the internet anywhere.  Anyone else had it happen? I guess I'm just desparate for someone to tell me it's all part of peri and not to worry. It's a 2 week wait till I can get to see my doctor.  Urgh."

tmpearce,2016-07-25T17:36+00:00,Confused about HRT,"Hi Ladies, I'm so confused about all of this ""to take or not to take HRT"".On one hand I hear that when we are in menopause and our estrogen levels become depleted it puts us at a higher risk of heart issues and breast cancer.On the other hand I hear that taking HRT can put us at a higher risk of heart issues and breast cancer. So...what does one do? I'm 55 and 8 months ago had hysterectomy removing uterus, cervix and fallopian tubes. Ovaries were in good shape and were left in on the premise that they would still continue to produce estrogen putting me into a slow menopause instead of immediate surgical menopause. I still feel the hormone changes I did before my surgery but can't tell exactly where in my cycle I am or how much my hormone levels have declined. I have symptoms of occasional nighttime hot flashes...not much during day. Guess I'm lucky...my GYN Dr says 10% of women don't have a lot of hot flashes. What I do have is terrible gastrointestinal issues, especially acid reflux. Also just plain tired and no energy and anxiety/worry issues are pretty bad. Lots of other minor issues that go along with this but the above mentioned three are the worst. My question is...should I or shouldn't I pursue HRT therapy? I have high blood pressure and hypothyroidism which are being treated. I'd appreciate any feedback from you wonderful ladies! Thanks??"

Guest,2016-07-24T12:17+00:00,UTI and food choices,"This is my third full day on Cipro.  I am drinking lots of water; still experiencing urgency and frequency but no other symptoms.  Drinking so much water is keeping urine very clear. The biggest problem I have is the Crohn's.  Antibiotics can cause digestive trouble, but some of the foods I can usually eat are off limits as I am avoiding simple carbs, anything too starchy or sugary, at all - no pasta, rice, white bread, etc.  I can't have whole grains, bran, or anything with high fiber.  Usually, I do okay with oatmeal, but lately I've had to avoid it because there is some active disease and it was causing some problems. I really need some kind of bread or carb that won't feed the UTI bacteria.  Looking online, I see that sourdough bread is an option.  Does anyone know if this would be okay with the UTI? Also, does anyone know if unsweetened cranberry juice helps if the bacteria is not E. coli?  I think cranberry is the source for d-Mannose, but I don't have E. coli according to test results and don't want to drink something that won't help.  I also read about blueberry juice.  I know sugary fruit juices are not an option. Trying to stay optimistic, but this is a nightmare."

The last few days I've had a fast heart rate and a tight chest. I didn't want to go to the doctor because I feel they think I'm a nuisance. However yesterday I made an appointment in the morning. It was not my doctor. I explained to her how I felt and told her I knew it was anxiety related. I told her I am having cbt sessions too. She checked my pulse and it was 127bpm. She said to me no wonder you felt terrible. She put me on beta blockers. She was very angry with my doctor for not being more helpful. She didn't actually make me feel like I'm mad. The fast heartbeat and feeling wired is awful. I'm on propomolol beta blockers,a low dose. A slight improvement perhaps. Fingers crossed. Take care ladies xx"

It went away for several days but came back last week this time with severe abdominal cramping. I went to the gp who ran blood work. My white cells are on the high side of normal. Poop test not back. Meanwhile she basically gave me no guidance other than to say that I am overdue for colonoscopy. I am feeling overwhelmed and want to just get the ultrasound under my belt. Anyone have stomach issues with menopause. I feel like I'm walking a tight rope here. I can't really take much more. It's like I turned 52 and I'm falling apart. I am in constant distress with my digestive tract and worried to death about the upcoming tests. I have family coming into town today and just don't know how I'm going to get through this."

She told me the name of the bacteria involved and it isn't Ecoli, which I'd read could be helped by d-Mannose.  The type I have is susceptible specifically to Cipro.  This NP is the nice, thorough one whom I saw for my sinus infection.  She made me feel reassured.  I'm following the Cipro instructions about timing, food, etc. to the letter!  I continue to appreciate your reassurance and am always so glad we can help each other here.  Praying and hoping I'll be better soon."

Just light spotting with horrible cramps. I have also had diarreah on and off for 3 weeks. I went to the dr and had pelvic with pap smear. The results on the lab isn't back yet bit she said all looked and felt normal. She dismissed the diarrhea issue as a possible virus. I have a referral for a pelvic sonogram that I am waiting ins clearance. But I'm scared here. My back is hurting but now I am seeing everything as a symptom. Scared"

Guest,2016-07-22T23:43+00:00,"PTSD to peri, getting back to good health","It was 3 years ago this week that I was in a bad car accident.  The worst of the PTSD lasted for about a year.  I got into some bad habits that year to try to comfort myself.  Overeating was the worst one, and eating lots of sugar, just giving up.  Won't mention all the others, but I lost sight of myself.  Peri-related panic started just over a year afterward, too, then my sister divorced the next year.  And then this year of health concerns has been tough... thought after I had ovary out in April and got through all those months of hurdles that I'd never take anything less than the best care of myself possible, but trying to get back to ""normal"" got me back into those old habits.  This is why I got so upset about the UTI and want so badly to have good self-care habits again."

Guest,2016-07-21T17:34+00:00,"Clinic/UTI follow-up news, really upset","When I saw the NP at the clinic on Sunday, she prescribed macrobid for a possible UTI and said she'd call if we needed to change to something else.  Found out during my lunch time at work that it is a UTI this time, not just irritation, and identified bacteria will not respond to macrobid - must change to Cipro.  I told her on Sunday that I'd taken Cipro before (the one other time I thought I had UTI and it wasn't an infection), but she wouldn't prescribe it.  I know how the irritation/infection occurred and hope it doesn't get worse.  Feeling bad that I took the macrobid for 4.5 days for nothing and it can cause C. diff later and ulcerative colitis, and I have Crohn's.  I am at work trying not to cry.  I know those who are used to getting UTIs probably think it is no big deal, but I am new to all this and don't want to wind up at the urologist's office again or the gyn or any of them.  I just need this ongoing year of medical/health nightmares to end and I'm afraid it won't and that I'll never really be well again.

I've been in peri-menopause for about a year now and I can honestly say that this is the worst things I've ever had to deal with in my life! I'm pretty certain that I have every symptom of peri there is, and probably a few more. I've had several test run that all come back negative. I've had scans and xrays and sonograms, etc. and I'm still not satisfied that something other than peri is at play here. Such a horrible feeling to always be concerned about your health!  Of course some days are more ""tolerable"" than others, but lately I've been having those days where I think I would be just fine to just lie on my living room, doing nothing, until this is all over!!!

michelle46271,2016-07-19T22:40+00:00,Making sense of all the symptoms,"Hi everyone I've been thinking about all the mad symptoms and experiences that I've had the last year. When I feel ok ish I just can't believe what has happened to me over time. Do you all feel the same? I think the mental symptoms have been the worse for me. I cannot believe that I have been bed bound for a bit (not know,dealing with it slightly better) The intense anxiety and panic feelings accompanied by palpitations and tightness. When you know you you are going somewhere you get worked up and really dread going bringing on the panic. I remember a year ago I was so bad with anxiety I would ring my mum up to come over,even in the middle of the night (when my husband was working) I worried about driving taking my kids anywhere. I would get my husband or my parents to drop them off. It seems insane looking back over all this. However I have made myself do things and it HAS been ok. I feel I have to be in control of where we go and get really anxious if we have to go further away. Looking back I thought I was actually going mad and I even felt like I wanted to go to a relaxing retreat but next day my outlook changed. My poor husband must have wondered what was going on. I was constantly in the doctors surgery and even took myself to A&E twice. I felt ashamed of myself and thought all my family must be so fed up. On top of the mental part are all the other symptoms Acid reflux Burning mouth syndrome Headaches every day Adrenal surges Doom and gloom No enthusiasm in anything Tmj The last month or so I've made myself do more and trying to brake the negative thinking and accept this phase of life. I really want to laugh and be happy with everyone and go places without a thought. We just have to be patient. Anybody have any stories? Sending hugs xxx"

She listed some details of an exam that she didn't actually do and completely made up a reason for my symptoms instead of writing what I told her.  She also listed a medication that I don't take in my records.  After so many doctor visits and surgery earlier this year, this is just more craziness I don't need.  Sooooo tired of this stuff!

cynthia00141,2016-07-16T05:39+00:00,Anyone losing weight? I live in yoga pants.,"I started the broken sleep at 44, the hot flashes at 48, the weight gain at 50, the stiff body parts at 51 and the heart palpitations at 52. My last period was October 2015. It's now been 8 years of feeling like a totally different person. I don't even like me anymore. I have no sex drive, and I only do it to keep the marriage going. It's sad, but it's life. I started using a little over the counter progesterone cream that has helped me get to sleep quicker when I wake up throughout the night, and the cream has helped the palpitations disappear. Cutting sugar out of my diet helped with the hot flashes, but it's the weight gain that bothers me the most. In the past year, the scale skyrocketed up 22 pounds (almost 10 kgs). It's mostly in my tummy area. I'm trying everything from eating healthy and exercising, watching calories, not eating too late, getting enough sleep, etc. I've always taken care of my body so eating healthy has been easy. I'm 6 feet tall, and I feel like a huge horse at this weight. I cry easily, and this makes me even feel worse about myself. I boxed up all my clothes, and I'm going to give them away if I can't lose this weight. Currently I live in yoga pants. My husband just doesn't get it and never will. Sorry to sound like a sad sack, but this has been so hard to deal with. I probably sound crazy to say this, but I liked getting my period. It never caused any problems. My mom breezed through menopause so I was surprised by all the changes. I never realized until now how hormones control everything. How is your weight? Did you gain a lot too? Has anyone out there had any luck with weight loss? I'd love to hear your stories."

I ache all over, cry at nothing and wake up mad as hell. I have many nagging headaches.  Its too hot to go outside.  I cringe when I think about going out in a crowd.  One other person in the aisle at the grocery store is one too many for me. I drop things and after 3 attempts, I just throw things. I run into furniture and doorways,  I can hardly utter a complete sentence without losing my words.  I just want to be alone!  I used to be the person that everyone came to with their problems.  They still do, but I find myself so much less sympathetic.  I want to scream ""Boy, you dont know what a real problem is!""   What makes me smile?  My husband leaving for a long business trip.  My beautiful granddaughter.  A funny movie. What time of the day do I enjoy?  Bedtime.  All of the days expectations melt away and sleep is my favorite escape. It's the one thing I'm still good at. I obsess over every conversation, every comment made to me, everything I do, everything they do.  Even the past.  Things I thought I had gotten over already.  I'm an over anxious, boring, teary-eyed, violently shaken bottle of soda. I take black cohosh, evening primrose oil (really worked on my sore breasts btw), and chasteberry, calcium with magnesium, on top of Fetzima.  And I would trade sore breasts for the mental anguish anyday. Nobody I know has had it this bad.  It sometimes makes me doubt the hormonal angle, and think I really am losing my mind.  Thanks for letting me vent."

Chuckj,2016-07-16T15:50+00:00,Coping with menopause,"I have been reading the posts on and of, and it has been a revelation that so many women are suffering so much. I have to say perimenopause was more difficult but actually not as difficult as premenstral tension. When I think back now that I am a year into menopause, perimenopause was unpredictable, periods coming when they wanted, still suffering acne outbreaks, headaches, mood swings and night sweats. But I coped without medication even though I had been through a bad time at work and then redundancy. Now in menopause, my blood pressure went up so on medication to control that. Had a breast scare, but found it was fatty tissue and now experiencing digestive issues, like IBS. However, the positives have been, my skin has cleared up, the best it has been since 16! I don't get the swings I mood, and where I might get annoyed with a situation, I can think it through rather than be reactive. I do still get foggy moments, but writing myself notes around the house or at work is great, and really boosts confidence when people are amazed you remembered to do something. I have noticed I had gained a few pounds, mostly in my belly region, not helped by the caesarean section I had 14 years ago, which makes that part of my body a bit of a bugbear for me. But on the positive side, I haven't gained that much weigh, it is more the fact that my body shape has naturally changed. The way I cope is keeping active with gardening; this helps to work up a sweat as I am beding, stretching, digging, pruning, pulling, therefore using various muscles. Also I watch what I eat and drink. Having developed headaches from drinking coffee, I don't drink this now. Having become lactose intolerant, although I suspect I have had IBS for a long time, and tolerated it I have reviewed my diet, and have low fod-map diet and take vitamins. I make an effort to meet up with friends and colleagues, and volunteer as well as work full-time, this avoids me isolating myself and becoming depressed. My home life is busy, with hubby and 14 year old daughter. Manage by having our own hobbies and interests. Sexually, I still feel interested, and that side is more Ok for me Tha my husband. I think men also have problems in that department as they age! I just wanted to put a positive post about this natural stage in women's lives, so that women don't feel completely down about menopause. Let's put it this way, I rather have my wisdom and knowledge than go back to being a naive 18 year old! Although physically, this would not be the case!??"

I can't remember if i've been tensing my neck or if it just happened as part of peri.  Anyway, i've been holding my neck rigid for so long now that I'm scared to move it around incase it makes me dizzy or lose my balance, I don't know how I'm going to correct this because i'm too scared to let anyone touch it I think the symptoms have got worse since my mum passed away in January this year.  I just wanted to know if any ladies have experienced this weird sensation, I can't really explain it but here goes.  As I said I dont really turn my head left or right or look up or down, i tend to avoid this, but sometimes when acknowledging what someones saying my head kinda nods by itself not noticeable  but as if it nods on the inside which makes me feel queasy, don't know if the nausea is anxiety or part of these horrible meno symptoms, it's really weird The sensations are causing me to suffer from panic disorder and very low mood as I can't see how I'm going to fix this Id be grateful if anyone can relate to this and offer any reassurance I've been on tibolone for approx 4 months Thanks, hugs Brenda xx PS I had a ct scan last year on head and neck which was normal"

When you do try to deep breath your body feels weird. Probably because it's been held tightly for so long.

Guest,2016-07-14T08:08+00:00,Menopause,"I have been taking HRT for 22 years. I have tried to come off the tablets only for the symptoms to return. I am now on a low dose and am trying to take only every other day to ween myself off them. My mum who is now 88year, is still having hot flushes, not as many as she used to have, nevertheless they still come, especially in the night. She tried HRT treatment many years ago and it was not suitable. I have always felt really well on HRT and upto now for me it has been safe. I am very fit and have no trouble with aching joints. I am told that I look a lot younger than my 66 years and I put this down to taking HRT. Is anyone else out there like me?"

One gyno said I was too young to start menopause and the second dr said that was going thru it. I have to say that i have been rather lucky throughout this 3.5 process with the exception of weight gain (which this alone is enough for a murder sentence) the night sweats are tollerable, no signs of depression or anxiety.  However, recently ive been experiencing lower back and abdominal discomfort similiar to how i use to feel when i was about to start my period.  Is this a sign that i might start or is it my body trying to tell me something else? With the exception of getting my A$$ to the gym any suggestion on how to get rid of my BELLY fat?

My main symptoms are: severe lightheadedness, dizziness, strange (metallic) taste in mouth, blurred vision, feelings of being off balance, anxiety and generally feeling 'out of body', lack of concentration. The GP has suggested HRT but not for at least two weeks as my blood pressure is too high (has put me on meds for this) and needs it to stablise first. I've no reason to be depressed or anxious but I'm worried I'll never be 'me' again. Many thanks, Debs"

All tests were ok, lab , ct ,ekg, etc. few days later had gallbladder out. Had to stay in hospital as I got a huge hematoma and became anemic. But nausea got worse and worse so 4 days after surgery got endoscopy. Said it was gastritis. So been taking Protonix. Acid reflux is incredible. Nauseousness better but still get it a little daily. Lost 10lbs in 3 weeks due to lack of appetite. But worst thing now is my neck turning, diagnosed as cervical dystonia got worse after surgery and it severely pulling to the left. My entire neck is so stiff and painful. Mostly I'm is sitting all day icing it against the back of the couch. Tried driving but too difficult can't look to change lanes or back up. Got Botox treatment yesterday so praying that will give me relief. Please keep me in your prayers. I feel like mine are not being heard. ??????

DianeH,2016-06-24T20:48+00:00,Endometrial biopsy ... should I be worried?,I continue to spot after 14 months on HRT. An ultrasound found several small fibroids in my uterus — none positioned in a way to cause bleeding — and a normal/desirable thickness (3 mm) on my endometrium. So I've just learned they want to do a biopsy. I know this is just a diagnostic tool and that it could be something other than cancer. But I'm worried. Hoping to find that it's just atrophy or even a polyp — though I realize a polyp would likely need to be removed. Anyone out there with a similar experience?

Irregular bleeding with only 9 days between, had a uterine biopsy taken which was all OK. Eventually I had to take prozac because of anxiety and panic attacks becoming uncontrollable. I haven't had a period for 2 weeks but I have had really bad aches in my lower back and thighs, before all this started I used to go to fitness classes 3 to 4 times a week, now I can't even go for a walk without the onset of aches. I also get some slight cramping in my uterus I also get what I describe as 'merry go round' feelings when I wake in the morning which I think are adrenalin surges. I take evening primrose , B6, Magnesium, zinc, agnus castrated & Flax seed oil I haven't experienced hot flashes but I do sometimes get feelings of hot waves for a few seconds.

I had a  hysterectomy 8 yrs ago , and have been   Struggling on with symptoms , I've hot flushes mood swings and joint pains ever since, . I didn't want to go on to HRT as I lost my mum just after my  hysterectomy ,due to breast cancer, which she was told by her surgeon at the time was  properly  caused by the HRT that she had been on, . Which she started on nine yrs  previously , and the cancer first showed its ugly head about 8 months after she went on the HRT. But having seen consultants ect who tell me, that because of the length of time my mum was actually on it, it was I fact quite unlikely that that was the cause. So after nearly 8 yrs of worrying about it , I couldn't stand it any longer, the hot flushes and mood swings are one thing , but the joint pains are so  debilitating , they first said it was  fibromyalgia , then after 5 years ruled that out,mainly due to the fact that I have  Osteo arthritis in my knees, which is why I had the half knee replacements in both legs,  so   Recently they did  x-rays on upper body, looking for the same, but nothing, so now they say it's caused by menopause , so I'm on 1 mg climaval, and in to my 3 rd week, and no change,. Any body else on it for the joints? Do I need to be upped ? I was sooo hoping it would work, I'm terrified I'll go the same way as mum, I can hear her saying already, "" I told you so"" but at the same time, I don't sleep, I have great knees now but walking in the cold weather with the dogs kills my upper body, I just want my life back.😩Would be great full for your input. ."

Got the feeling back and seemed normal.  But then I started thinking about it later in the day - that it had to be something deathly - as everything is these days.  And my head feels weird but I'm not sure if I am just imaging it because I am freaking out or what.  And then I start pacing and my legs start to feel weak and such a strange sensation comes over me - another anxiety attack.  Then I just start to cry to my husband who has been wonderful but can really never truly understand whats happening to me.  I called the neurologist on call and he seemed to think it was a pinched nerve in my neck that I was sleeping on it - given that an MRI I had earlier in the year came back normal.

BugglyBot,2016-07-03T14:32+00:00,Spotting,"I've been worrying all week. I found blood in my urine so the I went to see the doctor who acted quickly for me. I had a slight infection but just to be sure, I was referred to the hospital and on Friday, I went for a Cystoscopy. Thankfully my bloods were okay, (kidney and iron levels), and my bladder is fine. There was still a trace of blood in my urine so routinely, I'm being referred for a CT scan. Fingers crossed there is nothing to be found and everything is okay. I'm a worrier but I'm pleased the doctors just want to be sure. What is worrying me just as much, if not more, is that I've been spotting blood for over a week as if I'm having a period. I've done this before but this time is upsetting me. Everything down below is scaring me. The blood started off as dark/old but is now pink/red but it's because I'm still slightly spotting that I'm so upset, even though, again, I've had similar events before. I have had the Mirena coil for about four years now and given that my periods were extrememly heavy before, it's no surprise that occasionally I'll get a bleed over so many days. It's because I'm on high health alert that any rational thinking has gone out of the window. I'm having PMS symptoms that are all over the place, could this cause the spotting? If I wipe and it's clear, I feel less anxious but if the pink/red blood is present, I go back down again. It's been about nine days now and it is less but sometimes it's still there.  I've been feeling brilliant for a while. My sex drive has returned big time, poor hubby looks half scared of me sometimes. I'm glad it's back, it made me realise just how long it's been missing. I only have to look at a picture of him and I'm off. It is funny but at the same time I'm glad I have it again, although pleasantly surprised. I've started with losing weight and feel so much happier for doing something about it. I hate feeling so helpless with the health alert and now I'm scared I'll need to go back to the doctors and have even more tests.  I use small Tena pads anyway and the blood isn't a full period, to be honest a panty liner would be fine. I hope someone can understand what I mean here. Has anyone else had spotting like this while having the coil or even without one? Thanks for reading my post."

When it started I said that it was the one we had watched together in its entirety two days ago. She denied this in strong language and I tried to remind her of things she had said during the programme. She became madder and madder and said I must have indulged myself and watched it without her. I tried to point out that this was not possible but she was adamant, stormed off and went to bed slamming the door on me. I am worried that this is going to become a pattern and my wife is not going to accept that she is sufering from menopause related memory loss. What can I do?"
Guest,2016-06-27T16:41+00:00,Rough day,"I've been crying for a couple of hours and can't stop.  Last week, I figured out that I'm not going to make real progress with improving my health unless I get help with my anxiety.  Over the weekend, I talked about it in a forum here under Anxiety Disorders that is really super helpful and also talked with my sister about it.  Tomorrow morning, I have the colonoscopy that had to postpone due to my surgery recovery after having the ovary and polyps out in April, so going through the prep for that today.  Understanding now that with anxiety, Crohn's, and peri, I may be able to make better choices for managing the Crohn's and peri if getting help with anxiety becomes first priority.  Last two colonoscopies were a bit rough - had benign polyp removed in 2013, then had bad car accident, then had to have follow-up colonoscopy in 2014 because of previous polyp and was a nervous wreck - cried when GI doc came in to do procedure - but no polyps that time.  Wouldn't have guessed I'd be going into it this time less than 3 months after gyn surgery.  I know the tears are the anxiety talking, and know I have to learn to cope and manage.  Just realizing so much at once, it's really hard today."

Absolutely shattered (had about 20 hours sleep in the last month)no kidding. I feel anxious all the time now. I just can't relax,my body is so tense. Burning mouth Headaches and tinnitus constantly the last 5 months. Lightheaded. I'm sure certain things are due to the high anxiety. My thoughts and mood changes every hour. Well my doctor has not been that understanding. She put me on HRT because I asked her. I've had no discussions about it. Months ago she advised me to contact the NHS anxiety and depression service which I did and spoke with them a bit What annoys me is that she just thinks it is me I'm sure nothing to do with the menopause. When I rang her last week about possible checking hormones she replied that it is definitely not my hormones and to contact the anxiety and depression number again. That I had to do it for myself. Where do i go from here? She said there's nothing she can do . I don't want to feel like this,all this is getting me down.

sharcerv52408,2016-06-21T19:55+00:00,Here we go again!,"I saw a new GP today because I felt like my previous one who was much younger could not identify with my symptoms. So the new doctor who is much older and is a female saw me today. She said that she didn't think that the symptoms were peri menopause related. The only one that she did mention that was hormonal was of course the heat flashes. She indicated that my anxiety and panic attacks are not medical but rather circumstancial as if by some external stimuli. I told her that some of my symptoms I felt could have been side effects to my blood pressure medication (Amlodipine). She in essence discounted that claim but said that my digestive upsets were probably a result of the medication. But the other symptoms aside from the hot flushes were not hormonal in her opinion. She did do an EKG which was normal. But it is so frustrating and exausting trying to get these doctors to see that these symptoms are hormonal. If you're still seeing your periods normally and your bloods are in the normal range, they don't think you're in peri. It's a never ending story."

Sort of like a lot of things going on in my head at once. Like starting 10 things and not being able to finish anything. Does anyone feel like that. I am 55 yrs old and this past year and half have been going thru menopause. Sometimes I don't get my period for months, then I get it 2 times a month and now I haven't had it since March. This just came on all of a sudden. Does anyone else feel like this. It is making me crazy. I don't even want to do anything or go outside. I feel more comfortable when someone is home with me."

michelle46271,2016-06-20T12:41+00:00,Some improvements,Hi ladies I thought I would let you know the last 2 days haven't been as bad. Saturday I took my daughter and her boyfriend out for lunch and after went for a walk on the coastline. We did a couple of miles with some climbing on pebbles. It was a lovely sunny day. Yesterday I cooked for 7 of us for Father's Day. Today I'm going to do a few chores in town and take my daughter to have her prom dress adjusted. If I can stay in a positive mindset it may help. Here's hoping. I've been really concentrating on my breathing and slowing myself down. It is hard but before I was all hunched up and stressed terribly and rushing what I did. It's hard but it surely must help. Also looloo I have taken 200mg of utrogestan the last 2 days like you advised. 😊

Vile, vile - just had some more blood tests as am wondering if I am anaemic again!  So bored of it all now??!!!  have had all sorts of tests (including cardiac investigation) as health anxiety kicks in and have been convinced I am not long for this world but everything comes back 'within normal range,'  Does anyone else have these symptoms despite being on bio-identical replacement therapy???"

Suffered with health anxiety for quite some time (years) but recently have been feeling a lot better. Today though, I had that weird rushing sound in head and like their was pressure around ears and temples and it always makes me feel like I am going to pass out. Haven't had this for a while so I guess I am just seeking reassurance. Been on my period this week and not really taking great mental care of myself so I am wondering and thinking I probably stirred my nervous system back up. Been dizzy the last couple days too which is one of my biggest anxiety symptoms. What are your guys experiences with feeling like you are gonna pass oit?

Don't scare me with cardiac, blood sugar, and other such issues I have been to see the Dr and told it is anxiety and menopause) Click here to view image"

Last month and also in June,  I came over wth worse problems--my back starts hurting, then I feel bloated, my chest is aching, and I feel like my insdies (mainly ovaries) are being shreded. I felt like I had the flu last month (symptoms listed above). This month I didn't get a migraine but I have these miserable pains that lasted 5 days...today I am okay but aching on the side unless I take a pain pill. I can't get into a doctor right now (hooray for American medical system) but I did go to a walk in place. The doctor had no idea why I felt like this. I feel like my hormones have gone insane. If anyone has gone through this--please reply. I think maybe I have a cyst and it bloated me up but I don't know. My doctor's appointment is next month so right now I just need to hear from others. Oh, and I also lost my appetite. The first few days I can't smell food or certain smells without being put off (similar to pregnancy--which this is not!). Thank you!"

michelle46271,2016-06-16T17:23+00:00,Really really fed up.,Hi ladies Well I've come on here to express myself. I don't want to talk about it to my family. Some of you may remember I am on HRT. Certain things have slightly improved but nowhere near enough. I've been going back and forward to the doctors for months now. At the start of all this i was in bed with fear and panic. Now I can go places but don't feel comfortable for too long. Acid reflux is a bit better. Still got tense aching muscles. I have got burning mouth syndrome and a jaw problem which makes my head feel like it is blowing off and my face tingles and ears ring. I had a biopsy of my mouth and waiting for results. A week or so ago my blood pressure was low and I was told to have more salt . Also my throat is fluttery and a burning sensation (not the same as sheer panic) I cannot rest anywhere. I've been trying to accept that it will ease eventually. My mum reckons thyroid as a lady on here pointed it out but my doctor said I don't need to have a blood test because I had one nine months ago! Surely I should have one now? Overall my symptoms are still: Severe head and jaw pressure Tingling face Burning mouth syndrome Tight chest due to fluttery feelings in throat So tired and fatigued . I can take a lot but this is something else! What do you ladies reckon? Also I'm awaiting a neurologist app re my headaches and twitches. So down.

jamie50513,2016-06-02T22:04+00:00,Anxiety Attacks,"Hello Ladies, Since this whole hormonal business has started I have been thrown into anxiety. I vaguely remember having a little anxiety as a kid going through puberty but my mom said I did. Well fast forward to now, I know that some of the sensations and symtpoms can make me feel anxious to the point it plays on my mind. But what I didn't know was that I have been expierencing panic attacks. It just hits me out of nowhere and has me frightened to do anything. I can be driving, watching tv, or cooking and then all of a sudden I start to feel tingly all over, my heart starts racing and thumping hard, and then I begin to shake uncontrollably. It takes a while to calm down. Does anyone else expierence this just out of the blue? And is this considered a panic attack? I have been prescribed antidepressants but I rarely take them. Just wanted you all's take on this."

fiona69095,2016-06-14T10:14+00:00,Our own worst enemies,I think we are all ignorant of what menopause and perimenopause have in store for us. I had only heard of hot flushes and mood swings until it started happening to me. I know I am embarrassed to be honest about it at work and with friends. Who wants to admit that their reproductive era is over... Who wants to admit to work that they are struggling. I've been the only female on the work team all my life. I can't admit to them that my female hormones are affecting my performance. Men must feel the same when their prostrate starts to fail. Why do we keep hiding these issues?

When it's really bad I find it difficult walking or moving my head I've also got a sore stiff neck now, don't know if that's hormone related or if I've tensed my neck so much that I've caused it I was suffering from severe stress last January when the severe meno symptoms started the the weird off balance shaky vibrating symptom started, it's driving me crazy and causing me to be depressed and very anxious I also lost my mum in January this year which has not helped I just feel totally overwhelmed I'm 52, small built, the reason I'm saying this is someone told me if your slim you suffer more as your body cannot store estrogen, don't know if this is true I also suffer from migraine & nausea. Can any one relate to this, my GP and gyno have written me off as suffering from an anxiety disorder as they havd never heard of anyone suffering from severe meno symptoms such as mine I had a CT scan last year which was normal, seen an ENT specialist who said I may have vistibular migraine but I couldn't tolerate the nortriptyline med he prescribed I'd be grateful if any ladies can relate Love Brenda X"

lynda20916,2016-06-13T21:05+00:00,Endometrial Hyperplasia?,"Hello, all, I'm new to this group. I'm 67, and have been in full menopause  since age 40 because of a thyroid condition.  On April 14, 2016, I found some brown discharge, not much, but since then have had cramping mostly when I sit or lie down. Not bad cramping, just enough so I know something's there.  My OB/GYN gave me a pap smear, and had blood taken to test for ovarian cancer markers.  In the US, it's not recommended to do pap smears after 65, but my doctor disagrees, he said that the recommendation was based on the expense of the test.  So, pap smear normal, no indication of ovarian cancer markers in blood.  I also had an ultrasound and my uterine stripe measured at 8mm.  Next step is a biopsy done in office and I'm scared to death. Would any of you be willing to share your experiences with that procedure?  I'd really appreciate it!  Thank you!"
sazzie42,2016-06-12T19:23+00:00,Scan day,Hey ladies Had scan today - the young lady was very kind. I can contact the doctors next week for results. Walked out and just burst into tears. The waiting room was busy so I gave them something to laugh about. Had an embarrassing moment at a friends last night. I had braved it out - (took me 10 minutes to knock on the door. Then I totally flooded my underwear and jeans with an untimely period?!! I left the hospital and just wanted to go back to bed. Husband wanted to go for breakfast!! He reminded me he kindly picked me up this morning and it would be nice to do. I agree with this but not with how I was feeling. I try and explain but I'm not doing a very good job of it lol. In the restaurant again I was the entertainment for others- Not through choice. I got very upset - I could not stop the tears - hubby frustrated with me ( rather loudly) what have you got to cry about?? I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me. I wanted to hide under the table. ( I do have a bulging disc - to add to the pile) which has not helped. Finally got home and just wanted to go to bed. It was only midday. Totally drained and feeling so low the panic and dread of work tomorrow started to make my head and heart pound. The awful thoughts drenched my mind - breathing got harder- thoughts of not being good enough at work tomorrow ( on a phased return to work due to disc).so I feel like I'm being tested -- paranoia or what!!!! This has to stop? I laid my head on the pillow. The next I knew it was two hours later. Felt a bit wobbly but much better than earlier. Hubby bought up a cup of tea saying - this is not meant to make you cry but it's OK if you do I'm trying to understand!! We locked eyes and for that split second we smiled.- then I cried!!!!! What a roller-coaster of a day. Managed a walk before the rain. Had tea as a family and yes more tears. Ok if I'm going to do lots of crying that's the way it is. I will have to stop what people are thinking or that I have ruined their day as that makes me feel worse and I wonder if people are worried about me when they see me in tears - I doubt it. Let's see what Monday brings x Hope it made you smile ladies and please do laugh I know your laughing with me. Big hugs all.

That of course sent me into panic mode. I had to accompany my son's class on a field trip to the movies. I was anxious the whole time and couldn't enjoy myself at all. My reflux flared up which is what triggered the arm pain. It was awful! I felt so out of it the rest of the day. I was tempted to go to the ER but knew it was just a horrible case of anxiety. By bedtime I felt more like myself. But I can't wait for menopause to be over!

Now, a week later after that incident, I woke up with a sore throat and heavy bleeding AGAIN.  I am a little freaked out.  Has this ever happened to anyone?  I had a intravaginal ultrasound and an abdominal ultrasound about a month ago because I was really bloated and wanted to make sure all was well, and both tests were fine.   I should also mention that my pap smear 5 months ago was normal.  Are there any tests I missed?  I am going to call my doctor Monday am.  Thanks for your help."
cheryl99068,2016-06-03T05:09+00:00,Glad To Know I'm Not Going Crazy,"I'm so happy to have found this discussion board.  Each time I read a new post, it lets me know I'm not alone in what I'm going through.  I can't talk to anyone in the family, as my grandmother was the only one who went through meonpause, as the other women in my family had hysterectomies before menopause.  I had an andometrial ablation 6 years ago and it worked up until the past 7 months, with the last two being periods for 2 weeks with heavy clotting and flooding.  I actually ended up in the ER two weeks ago as I was bleeding so heavy.  I was advised to call my GYN on the Monday following and they worked me in within a few days.  My doctor told me he was shocked that I'm still having my periods as I'm 53 and will be 54 in Oct.  He gave me 4 options, another ablation in which he didn't advise, an IUD, Depo shot or hysterectomy.  I can't use birth control pills due to high blood pressure. So, I elected to go with the Depo shot.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed as since having the shot on Tuesday I have read horrible things about the shot, one being how it makes you bleed more.  I have been bleeding nonstop for over two months now, so we went with the Depo in hopes it would stop the bleeding.  I'm curious to know if anyone else has used the Depo shot to help stop the bleeding and if so what has your experience been like? So, like I said I'm keeping my fingers crossed that Depo shot works for me. In the past two months I have started going through things that made me think I was loosing my mind.  I'm usually a heavy sleeper and barely hear my alarm clock in the morning.  Now, I'm waking several times during the night, up about an hour or two before my alarm goes off.  Not getting much sleep at all needless to say.  I'm so jittery, with hands shaking, jump at the slighest of sounds and high anxiety.  I have no energy, in fact after work I have things I want to get done around the house when I get home.  However, by the time I get home all I want to do is take a nap.  One thing I don't seem to suffer from is night sweats or hot flashes.  I do have a weird thing though, my upper lip gets cold and a light sweat on it at times, and it doesn't even have to be hot out when this happens. So, I guess I can say I'm in perimenopause, and maybe finally heading into menopause.  I sure would like to get my life back to some sort of normal, where I'm not afraid to leave the house for long periods of time or go to far from home in fear that I will suddenly start bleeding heavy again."

Guest,2016-06-11T03:31+00:00,Is this an eating disorder? Body dysmorphia?,"Recently, I've shared in the forum that I came up with a new eating plan to try to lose weight and keep my Crohn's disease from rearing its ugly head.  It has only been this year, as the peri has taken hold, that I have hit my highest weight ever, but I've been struggling with a gradual weight gain off and on for several years now.  Last weekend, I found that I had lost 1.5 pounds.  But things got a bit scary this week. My sister invited me on a one-week beach vacation with her and her two young sons.  I came here determined to eat only healthy, Crohn's friendly foods and not to gain weight.  For the first four days, I drove myself nuts, being extremely diligent about what I was eating, pushing myself to take long walks on the beach every morning and to go to the exercise room in our hotel daily.  I was getting in about twice as much activity as I had at home, according to the unforgiving FitBit that I started wearing not long after I finished a month of recovery from my surgery (I've worn it daily for a month).  For those four days, I got in about 5-6 miles per day of walking and also using a treadmill or exercise bike.  I avoided having more than something small for a sweet treat, like a small cookie, once a day.  And I was hungry a lot. Yesterday, it all caved in... I had a Crohn's attack and got very sick.  I cut back on the exercise and fell back into eating more comfortable foods that helped to stabilize things some.  But the guilt I feel is huge.  Today, I was disappointed to ""only"" get in four miles of walking, in spite of the extreme heat outside (which of course helped bring on the attack).  I feel bloated and fat again.  I went out sightseeing this morning in the heat and had to go into a cool building because I felt sick on my walking tour.  I have a scheduled colonoscopy in two weeks, just had surgery two months ago, and I am really starting to feel at war with myself.  I hate my body.  I worry about my weight making my health worse.  It has become a constant fear.   Perimenopause feels like like another disease to me.  I can't seem to find a middle ground with this, accept that I don't have to be perfect.  But I look and feel terrible about myself all the time now. I don't know what to do."

michelle46271,2016-06-09T12:27+00:00,"Doctors,doctors,doctors!","Hi ladies Well like all the lovely ladies on here I am fed up with the doctors. The last 6 months my menopause symptoms have been unbearable at times and that's no exaggeration. All the times I went to the doctors they never mentioned perimenopause. They prescribed me antidepressants. I started with terrible head pressure which radiated to my face. Doctors said sinus problems. Kept fobbing me off. I finally saw an ENT specialist which put the camera up my nose. Surprisingly my sinuses were clear. In January panic swept in,couldn't go anywhere. Doom and gloom set in. No interest in anything. I felt frightened all the time and honestly didn't know where to turn. I actually thought I was loosing it! All my doctors said was'poor you' . They gave me sleeping tablets as I was desperate to just get some sleep. The panic has been a struggle but is slightly easier after finally asking my doctor for Hrt. I've been on it 12 weeks now. I just can't believe how many frightening mental things there are. Well I went today as I feel so Lightheaded when I get up from bending down and no energy. She said to me did I feel like I needed to adjust my Hrt? That's what I went to her for! As I was just about to go with no advice she took my blood pressure which was 89/67. She looked at me and I'm sure she was surprised it was low,I had the feeling again that she thought I was making it up. She told me it was very low and I have hypotension. Eat salt and do everything carefully. I have to go back next week to see my own doctor(who is never there). I will be talking about adjusting the HRT. I am waiting for her to refer me for a scan for my head. Also a neurologist. The ENT specialist suggested this but I'm still waiting for her to refer me. I've even said I will go private. It's taking such a long time to get anywhere. I'm so fed up. I actually feel like I shouldn't go to see the doctor that they will be thinking oh no not her again! I'm 47 next birthday. I'm doing all the research not my doctor. I'm beginning to think I should see a private menopause specialist! Moaning over ladies x"
sentoholistics,2016-01-13T19:28+00:00,Endometrial Hyperplasia Advice,"I had an ultrasound scan in May last year which diagnosed endometrial hyperplasia with a lining of 12mm. I had a biopsy and this came back all clear and I was told I didnt have womb cancer and the cells were simple.  I have just had another ultrasound and my womb is 13mm thick and I have been bleeding since 27 November (heavy since 1 Jan). I have been told this is just due to hormonal imbalance of the perimenopause and nothing sinister.  My GP wants me to have the mirena coil but I am concerned about this. I want to try and go through this as naturally as possible and my thoughts are that putting progesterone into my body every day, when it doesnt normally produce it every day, and when my progesterone levels are declining naturally, is the wrong thing to do. However the coil will thin my lining. If I leave it as it is, then I could be at risk of developing womb cancer, especially if my oestrogen isnt being balanced by progesterone.  Anyone have any thoughts or advice they could give me as I cant decide what to do for the best."

In about 10 minutes, I could get up, get to the car, and drive home.  Now I am lying down with a fan on me and I have a headache.   I'm pretty sure this could be my induction into the world of hot flashes.  It was awful.  I'd love to hear stories and advice.   Thank you!"

I have been on anti depressants since the end of January when I felt like I was having a breakdown . I had been unwell with numerous problems for a few months . Anaemia due to heavy periods , unsettled stomach , general aches and pains , migraines and headaches . I even went to A&E with chest pains , but after a thorough check up from a consultant was told that it was all down to anxiety . I'd had a lot to deal with in the previous few months following my mums death . Each time I have visited the doctor they have put it down to a mixture of grief , anxiety and my age as I'm 48 . The thing is this full feeling in my stomach has come back along with nausea . I feel like if I push my stomach it makes me feel more nauseous . When I get this I keep coming over really hot , but is it the nausea causing the heat surge or the heat causing the nausea ? I don't have any pain . I did just have a period that was heavy , stopped but I've still had an ache low down then this morning two days after I finished I had a bit of blood in my discharge . Are all these things related ? Is it peri ? I just want to know what this stomach issue is . Has anyone else had this . I hate it and I really don't want to continue feeling like this . I really think I should go to the doctor but my husband and daughter say that it's nothing to worry about , but they're not the ones feeling like this . I hate feeling sick like this . Jane x"

I have a history of lower back pain, but doc is saying it's not able to travel up my spine that something else is going on.  What???  I've had ct scans of abdomen, ultrasound of abdomen, transvaginal us.  The only thing that comes up is a thickening of uterus requiring a D&C.

Only cholesterol elevated which I have known about anyway. She is the first doctor to actually say to me 'you are perimenopausal. She said I could try hrt if I wanted but said that there is a risk of clots so offered this drug Effexor. She said it is an antidepressant but is used in peri for the hotflushes and moodswings. My main symptoms at the moment ( i can cope with the rest) are anxiety and flushing so am considering taking this. Has anyone else on here tried it? I am 48 and probably have a good few years to go before menopause is over so not sure which route to take. I just can't cope with the 10 or so days a month where the mood swings are severe.

Some of them barely showing anything, and others being long cycles like 70 days instead of the usual 30ish. Luckily they have not been heavy bleeds or very crampy and last 6-7 days. My most recent cycle was 64 days with a 6 day bleed, and then on day 16 I had some spotting as I went to bed. Was all clear next day and the same thing happened again at bed time with another sign of spotting. Now today I am spotting ie there is some blood with a little mucus every time I wipe after I pee. This week I have hormonal acne on both side of my chin and feel a little hormonal, bloated etc. That has not happened in a LONG while. I've been very active what with bending and stretching with gardening lately. Would that kick something off?? I am trying not to panic, but of course that is easier said than done.  I also have Hashimoto's and trying to get that into remission. I know that can play havoc with hormones too.  So, I am going to get checked, but in the meantime I am so scared!"

They had been irregular before then for about a couple of years.  Since my last period I have had some, what I'd describe as, blushing.  Not like I remember my mum having hot flushes, but just hot cheeks, several times a day. I've been achy in my joints for two or three years, but not worse now.  I feel pretty calm and relaxed.  Should I just wait and see what happens or should I get a blood test to confirm menopause? Is it necessary to see GP if I don't feel unwell as such?  I feel older, but not unwell!  The other thing I'm worried about is that my period might start randomly and heavily somewhere embarrassing, as I have no idea if and when I might have another one.  Is it possible for periods to stop without any major problems, or am I kidding myself that you can just pass through menopause?"

There is no pain but at times some cramps. Has someone been through this and found it was ok? They did an ultrasound yesterday and I am waiting results . Also prior to the periods stoping in December I had hot flashes for the first time around October of 2015. They were intense and I suffered about 8-11 episodes per day. These stopped in January.

CCinCal,2016-05-12T04:21+00:00,Help! Dr Says it's Not Peri,"Hi Ladies So today I went to see a new gyno (female) and told her my symptoms below. She said since my fsh is only 7 that I wasn't in peri yet. This is my 4th gyno. The first one put me on birth control and after 6 months or so my pms symptoms came back tenfold. For various reasons she wasn't the right fit. The second and third gyno were not very supportive. They rushed in and basically wanted to give me the BC pill before rushing back out. They also said I wasn't perimenopausal because I was still having periods monthly plus because my symptoms were with me all month and not just around my period time. When I kept telling the second gyno my symptoms, out of frustration and lack of time (only spent 10 min. At appointment) he wrote out prescription for HRT. Then he rushed out the door. When I got home and looked at the prescription it was for the highest dose. When I emailed him, he didn't even remember. And when I asked how I should take them, he said it was up to me since it was experimental. I don't want to start HRT without a good supportive caring doctor so hence the fourth gyno. The fourth one seems supportive and she wants to check my fsh and hormone levels this next period on day 3. None of the other ones did any testing except fsh. So she seems more thorough. But she is saying BC pill rather than HRT. After being on this board and having so many identical peri symptoms I'm sure that I'm peri. I'm 47. I feel so confused. Do I keep looking for a new gyno? Do I just experiment and try HRT on my own? Any suggestions, thoughts would be appreciated. Some of the symptoms I have: Feeling generally horrible Depression Anxiety Irritable Off balance feeling Fatigue Doom and gloom feeling Brain fog Waking up middle of night warm all over Forgetful, can't concentrate/focus Wobbly legs Nausea Heart palpitations Cramping Nauseous Overwhelmed with the littlest of things"

suzydoo,2015-09-01T19:06+00:00,Hope my story on menopause may help?,"Hello I have been reading these discussions and this is my story and I hope it may help. my menopause/peri menopause started when I had my last baby at 33 years old I was ignored by my doctor at 35 - she said you are too young (my mum had early menopause) I suffered and boy I Tsuffered till I was 37 my periods had completely stopped for 8 months and I had done a diary and taken every herbal remedy - the last straw was when I was on my way to pick up the children from school at around 3pm and I nearly fell asleep whilst driving. I went armed to the new doctor who immediately put me on HRT one week later confirmed I was in full menopause.... HRT saved me, I felt me again no more night sweats anxietyweight gain depression constant hot flushes mood swings fatigue bones aching headaches just a few of the symptoms - fantastic wow brilliant all gone with my magic pill.  I am now nearly 49, oh dear the last few years tons of changes including divorce new home older children being abusive to me like their father. New partner then that ends mother with invasive bladder cancer and dementia moving end of partnership court cases with ex husband for custody him lying I won. 7 years of bad luck - then my health started to go down hill around 5 years into this. 6 months ago just want it to all end so depressed tired and the fatigue hot flushes weight gain achy bones all the symptoms again however I didn't recognise. Thought it's my age? Been seeing the doctor for anxiety and depression since last year all foggy so tired! June this year doctor does extensive blood tests for everything- all clear my liver kidneys heart everything good! So what's wrong? the night sweats must be cancer so bad the lack of sleep!! no a new doctor after a run around as I said I feel I'm going through the menopause- my body doesn't like proestrogen so new HRT now taking wow amazing I have energy I feel normal no more mood swings no aches no headaches. My doctor said we will review HRT as other doctors have when I am 50 years old I said I will sign a disclaimer I never ever want to come off. My new doctor said that is my choice I can have as long as I want and if I want to try another HRT fine. To add to all this I have had scans a smear and a mammogram all clear.  Reading some of the discussions my reply is why oh why come off if it makes you feel so miserable love it and except and just keep up the checks and be happy - if I die at 90 I will still be on it. I said to my doctor I will sign a disclaimer I have the right to choose. Don't feel guilty. If we have a headache we take a tablet same thing."

I have been through hell and back with so many symptoms  that left me completely worried, I have been to all check ups without  any concrete answer. This started 3 years ago,  is there anyone who's been through this for such a period? My symptoms range from anxiety, depressed, tensed joints, bloated stomach, foggy sensation in the head and very painful neck pains. I also had problem with fibroids and had them operated on last year with the hope that the feeling would be better but the change is so minimal that I feel so depressed and not more energetic like before.  Is any  one going through this and what are the best remedies to handle this . Please help me out."

I hope someone here can give me some good advice.  You see, my wife who was formerly quiet, sweet, and charming has turned into major bitch since menopause.  She now tries to micromanage me and other family members, she demeans me and others, she yells at counter attendants when we go shopping, she reaches over and blasts the horn at other drivers when I'm driving.  I could tolerate most of all that if it weren't for the fact that she has shut me out sexually for a year now.  I've tried to discuss it with her, but she just shrugs me off.  She further refuses to discuss it with her gynocologist.  I'm at wits end and ready to give her an ultimatim.  Please help."

Incidentally I also wondered if any of you ever experienced odd twitches and or tickling sensations in your head/scalp? It has been annoying the heck out of me!

I am reading that it is due to prostaglandins building up in our bodies and this can be very common. Has anybody else had this? I am also reading just to take Motrin to help with this. I felt awful last night, took a Motrin and felt great until just now. The low grade fever is back, as well as the achey feeling and sooo tired!"

Guest,2016-05-07T12:22+00:00,Depressed,"I am 4 weeks post-op now and went back to work 2 days ago.  It is not going well.  I've mentioned this somewhere else in the forums, but nothing has changed... I had this idea pre-surgery that I'd feel better after I got ""back to normal"" or ""into my routine"".  Had my post-op evaluation on Wednesday, which went fine.  Somehow, during my recovery leave time following the surgery, I did a better job of taking care of myself than usual, especially the 4th week, and really took the time to eat properly, get plenty of rest, etc.  Now that I'm back to my life, so to speak, I feel awful.  It doesn't help that I found out yesterday at work that my gyn's office screwed up my medical leave paperwork, telling my employer that I was cleared for only one week of leave while my gyn told me at the pre-surgery consultation that I was cleared for 4 weeks, which I took and needed.  So now I have to straighten that out.  It never ends.  When I found that out yesterday, I just put my head in my hands and started to cry at my desk.  On the way home from work, I was sitting on the bus and thought, nothing is any better, I feel just as sad as I did before the surgery.  Came home to the evening routine I'd hoped to change, too, that involves going to a nearby grocery store, buying a ""meal"" of more than a meal should be, and eating it all at home, then doing nothing.  Binge eating just makes me fatter.  Even my 13-year-old nephew, who is into healthy eating, told me the other night that I eat too much sugar.  He's way too young to understand, of course, he just wants me to be well.  My life doesn't feel like a life, yet I have many good people in my life and things I wish I could do.  My gyn did not talk with me on Wednesday about the peri or anything, she was in a hurry and it was a brief consultation.  My family has had a lot of serious problems going on for over a year now.  I have a colonoscopy scheduled next month because of my Crohn's.  There has to be a way to feel better and be able to function and deal with everything.  Every time I think I can do what I need to do to get help, I get sad again and end up in bed just lying around.  My job is in a highly intense, competitive environment, and I feel that it's making everything worse and wish I could find something in a smaller organization with less craziness, but the benefits are great and I've been there almost 13 years because I need the good insurance coverage and leave time.  That's what keeps me there.  So there is the heavy feeling daily of wanting to do something new layered over the peri, the family troubles, the post-surgery letdown, the Crohn's, etc.  My gyn is a nice doctor and I really like her and feel at ease with her, but her office staff, other than the nurses, are not helpful.  It took literally 4 weeks pre-op to get them to turn in my leave form, and now I find out that it's incorrect.  I faxed a letter to the doctor about it because the woman who handles the forms won't return my calls.  I don't know what to do.  Functioning on a basic level is getting a lot harder, even though somewhere in my mind I can picture doing things I want to do.  I just want to be me again.  I feel stuck, as though this will go on for years and the best years of life are over, but I don't want that to be true."

TopsyUK,2016-05-07T19:13+00:00,Help! Has anyone experienced red-brown spotting midcycle?,"Last saturday on day 13 of my cycle I started spotting - nothing major just there when I wiped.  Nothing on sunday (relief!) but started again on monday which went on till tues pm - stopped then restarted weds pm and since then every now and again but getting less each time.  Its now a week later and when I think its finally stopped I'll visit the loo and there's a tiny bit still.  Not always though.  I am terrified to go to the loo and so aware of every feeling. Im in pieces over this :-(  Up and down and worried.  Had a pelvic scan recently and have a thin uterus which I understand is good in terms of any nasty conditions.  Also have a couple of fibroids but GP says they won't cause bleeding as they're not in a certain place.  Have an appointment for a womb biopsy which totally terrifies me (I should not google!). Anyway, just wondering if anyone else been through similar and if its peri or fibroids or even stress - Starting a new job on monday which must be taking its toll. Would appreciate any pearls of wisdom.  I'd explode with madness if I wasn't so tired from lack of sleep worrying.  Crazy. Crazy. Crazy. Thanks x"

My left seems to be more achey and feels tender sometimes when i press it in then other days when i press it in theres no pain. Sometimes it feels like when you stretch a ligament in my left. I have had a good feel and i can't feel anything myself. I am worried because the GP didnt feel my abdomen and just put it down to perimenopause because my FSH  and LH were raised. I have gained weight all over but particularly around my lower abdomen. Google is my worst enemy.

I seem to start getting symptoms around ovulation time which for me was always around day 10 or 11 and giving that my period has extended from 4 days to at least 7, it really doesn't leave a big window. I am also no good 10 days leading up to my period and so often there is no break. One of the thing I suffer with is breast tenderness and joint pain.

I had a marena coil fitted then and had blamed that for my lack of period.  Other than that I had no symptoms.  I had the coil removed when I was about 45 and - no period.  I  should have sought advice sooner but as I was symptom free and I didn't bother. I was also not in a relationship so sex was not an issue but now I realise my libido is zero and my ahem - lady bits - are like a desert, I realise that sex is no go and that thought makes me very sad.  I feel I am still young and active.  I really feel I have been dumped on the scrapheap big time. Does anyone have any advice on increasing libido and also suggestions for either eostrogen cream or lubricants that might help. Can you use eostrogen cream long term? Please help!"

karenskip,2016-02-17T13:28+00:00,Menopause and fsh level low?,"I may sound stupid but don't know who to ask on this. I am 50 years old and when I was 48 my periods started going all over the place. Firstly I would be every couple of weeks and then now I can go 3 months . Of course I thought menopause as I had night sweats although never any daytimes flushes. My gp tested my fsh and it was only 5. Apparently she said it needed to be over 20 for years to be perimenopause usually so it was ruled out. I was sent for ovarian scans which said I had a dermoid cyst but only small. I was told they would rescan which they did a year later and still only small. I continued to get no periods only every two or 3 months. They redid my fsh which again was 5 or less so again they have said I am not anywhere near the menopause. I have now gone almost 3 months without any period and my moods are swinging and although still not got any daytime hot flushes, I do have some night sweats. I have dry skin, my hair is changing texture and I have numerous other niggling symptoms. Would anyone say I am approaching the menopause although my docs say not as my fsh is that of a very young person. Can you have a low fsh but be in the menopause."

michelle46271,2016-04-28T11:55+00:00,Feeling a bit better. Could be HRT patches.,Hi ladies Just sharing something which may be of interest to some. I started the HRT patches about 6 weeks ago and I think they are starting to help. My panic and anxiety has eased a lot the last few weeks. I havent had a night sweat for 3 weeks now. The horrid bitter taste in my mouth has eased a bit the last few days. This was horrid. My burning mouth and tongue has felt a bit better the last 3 days. Still got it a bit but not as much. Not as many palpitations. Got out for a walk with my husband on Tuesday on the coastal path (no panic) Went out in to town and got things for the house. A few weeks ago I would never thought this. There are things still there a bit but not as bad. People do say they take a few weeks perhaps that's what is happening with me. If there are any ladies who are thinking about going on it I recommend it. I wasn't planning on going on HRT but I want to enjoy the next few years with my family. In 5 years or so my kids would have left home so I'm making the most of it before they do.

I've been peri-menopausal for at least 5 years but NOW...O.M.G!!! ...what in God's name is going on with me???!! So I was used to knowing when my periods were going to start:  I'd have breast tenderness, lower back pain, ovaries would hurt, a little hormonal and moody, but NOW...my PERIOD (when it shows up) has it's own agenda!   About 4 months ago, I noticed that my periods where getting longer.  I swear I was literally bleeding for 2 weeks (I was thinking I should start taking Iron Pills!) Then my periods would become unpredictable - which is what's going on now.  My period is 2 weeks late!  I hate this!  I feel like I now have to plan my life around my unpredictable PERIOD! What if it starts while I'm (insert activity here)? Not only that, I'm exhuasted ALL.THE.TIME.  Even after I've slept...I could go right back to sleep.  Now, keep in mind, I'm very fit, and very active and in good shape.  My workouts just leave me drained now.   A part of me feels like ""wait just one damn minute!  I don't look 50.  I don't feel 50.  But my body is reminding me that it's 50!""  It's like Nature's cruel joke...but I'm not laughing! More hotflashes, I cry at the drop of dime!.....no, really.

Although there's freedom in 50, it comes with this menopause crap!   Unfortunately, I can't take HRT (had a pulmonary embolism with my last child).

manuela67667,2014-12-29T04:46+00:00,HRT- when to start with it????,"Ok, I am 41 years ""old"" and one of the unfortunate to go through menopause early... I skipped periods in late 2012 upon which I went to see a GP and we did a bloodtest which revelaed a FSH of 110 (he didnt think anything of it...). I had an uterine poly so I saw a Gyno who removed it and that one said I might be in perimenopause...- ok....mmhhh. So I continued on with life, having bouts of anxiety, feeling a bit bloated with fluid retention, putting on weight etc... In May/ June I started to feel progressively worst, mainly anxiety wise...I started to get brain fog, dizzyness, feeling slugish etc which made my anxiety even worst. Thats when I started to see a Psychologist as really I didnt think it had to do with hormones as such ( I was prone to anxiety before).....I was on a AD that time also but I ditched it after 5 years as seriously the AD didnt do anything opposite, I found it made my confusion with brain fog even worst... I found then a new GP in June also, who did the full blood test which revelaed my progesterone was down to 1. FSH 75. So she gave me a progesterone cream in order to protect the uterus and getting regular bleeds. Well that worked for 4 cycles, but with the last 2 I started to feel even worst...just a general feeling of not being well, tired, very sleepy, anxious, brain fog etc... So in November we checked FSH/ Oestrogen and Progesterone again. FSH went up to 110/ Progesterone gone up to 11 as well but Oestrogen dropped to 80 (lutheal phase). - So I figured my worsening is due the Oestrogen drop... My GP suggested to keep up the Progesterone Cream, and gave me an AD again..(I havent filled it as it is Paxil and I read its bad withdrawal effects...). I told her that I think I dont need the AD just yet, but maybe Oestrogen??? On which she stated that HRT ususally isnt given until a woman has not had the period for 12 months as the hormones are still spiking.... Now I wonder about the ladies on here, when did you start HRT? And also, do you use synthetic or natural? I know that yes, generally let nature let its course...but with 41 I feel I am too young for that. I think in my case it might be wise to go and use some sort of HRT (as low dose as possible to counteract some of the symptoms and health problems) for maybe another 4-5 years. I am just confused now as to why my GP said to wait until all is over...Surely one can go on HRT if still in the perimenopausal stage (according to having bleeds still anyway)?

jayneejay,2014-10-09T18:15+00:00,Menopause - Side Effects of a Hysterectomy .. useful info ..,"What Are The Side Effects Of A Hysterectomy? Quite a bit of research has been carried out into the effects of a hysterectomy procedure on a woman's body and general well-being. As with so much of science, many of the results have been conflicting. The Maine Women's Health Study is one important piece of research which has shed a better light on the subject. Researchers investigated the long term effects on nearly 800 women who had undergone a hysterectomy between 1989 and 1991. Overall it appears that the surgery improved a woman's quality of life, particularly if she underwent the procedure for less 'serious' problems like fibroids or endometriosis (as opposed to cancer). It found that hysterectomies performed to correct severe pelvic pain and heavy periods left 71 percent of women feeling much happier (physically, mentally and sexually). New problems that arose as a result of the hysterectomy (where the woman did not have the problem before the operation) included hot flashes (13 percent), weight gain (12 percent), depression (8 percent) and less interest in sexual intercourse (7 percent). Hot Flashes A hot flash is where you feel a sudden intense heat which starts in the neck and flows up to the face. Hot flashes usually last around 30 seconds and can be one of the first signs of menopause. Women who have their ovaries removed immediately enter menopause (if the woman is still young, it is referred to as premature menopause). They may be given short-term estrogen replacement therapy to help manage the problem. Interestingly, for reasons unknown, women who have not had their ovaries removed can still have hot flashes. Presumably this is because their hormone balance is upset. Fortunately this is usually a temporary complication. Weight Gain Although a minority of women gain weight after a hysterectomy, it is thought this is less to do with the procedure and more to do with inactivity during the recovery period. Weight gain is avoidable by following a healthy calorie controlled plan until you resume normal activity. See also our article weight gain during menopause. Depression While some women may feel depressed after a hysterectomy, there is no evidence to suggest that it is a physical or chemical response to the operation itself. It may rather be a psychological reaction to loss of fertility (in younger women) or a feeling of despondency if they did not participate enough in the decision to have the surgery (more common in non-elective hysterectomies which are performed as a medical emergency). For most, research shows that a hysterectomy rarely causes long term depression. In the initial post-operative period, women do much better if they have the support of their family and friends. You may find it useful to read about the side effects of depression, just in case. Sexuality Issues Physically, you should be able to return to having sex within 8 weeks of surgery (see hysterectomy recovery). There have been lots of studies into women's sexual function and desire after a hysterectomy. Older studies which used slightly different measuring methods estimated that 50 percent reported improved sexual function (usually because sex was painful before surgery), 25 percent reported no change and the remaining 25 percent said it was worse. Newer studies estimate that only about 5 percent of women report worsening sexual problems. The most common complaint is vaginal dryness (atrophy) - that is where the lining of the vagina becomes thinner and there is less lubrication so sex becomes more painful. This can happen if the ovaries are removed and estrogen levels fall. Other women report increased problems in becoming sexually aroused or in having orgasms. The removal of the womb and cervix means that there is less tissue to become 'engorged' during sexual arousal. Also as there is no womb, there no longer is a sensation of it expanding during an orgasm, which may make the orgasm less intense. These changes are very apparent in some women but completely unnoticed in most. The Alternatives: Surgery vs. Non-Surgery The Maine Women's Health Study also investigated women who chose to manage their condition (fibroids, uterine bleeding or chronic pelvic pain) with non-surgical methods. These alternatives to hysterectomy included hormone therapy, pain medications, endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolization. 25 percent went on to have a hysterectomy within one year of the study because their symptoms persevered or reappeared. However, more studies are required before concluding whether surgery or non-surgical intervention is best. These studies are notoriously difficult to carry out, and one recent large-scale attempt was abandoned because of difficulties in recruiting participants and in implementing the trial. 90 percent of hysterectomies are performed on women for non-cancer reasons, such as fibroids or uterine bleeding. As most hysterectomy alternatives are considered safe, doctors are advised to completely exhaust these more conservative options before recommending surgery. While this is considered best practice, unfortunately not all doctors do this. One study by the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California discovered that 76 percent of women who underwent a hysterectomy did not meet the standard guidelines for the procedure (as set down by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists). The most common reasons cited why the operation was considered inappropriate were: (1) the doctor did not order enough tests to adequately diagnose the patient's condition before recommending a hysterectomy or (2) the doctor did not try enough alternative treatments. Bottom Line: Given the potential side effects, as well as possible hysterectomy complications, it is important to educate yourself on all possible alternatives before agreeing to undergo a hysterectomy. Question your doctor, and if you are not satisfied with the answers, seek a second or even third opinion if necessary. At the end of the day, it is your body and you will be the one who has to live with the result."

CCinCal,2016-04-23T20:17+00:00,From Birth Control Pill to HRT,"Hi ladies Has anyone else been put on BC pill for their peri symptoms and then changed over to HRT? I was prescribed the pill about a year ago for mood stabilization when I went into bad depression. I'm wanting to transition from the pill to HRT and wanted to hear how other ladies made the switch. Did you stop BC one day and start HRT the next? Or did you give yourself a break from the pill before starting HRT? And if it helped relieve your symptoms? Truth be told I'm SO scared to do this. I don't know if the pill has helped since I have so many symptoms still. And I don't want to get back into the deep depression I was in. I'm so unfunctional this past year I need to try something else but at the same time so fearful of bad side effects and making things worse. My symptoms are depression, anxiety, off balance/woozy/dizzy feelings, mood swings, wobbly legs, alway feeling like I'm going to pass out, feeling weepy, neck tilting to side, irritability, overwhelmed easily, fatigue, can't concentrate, severe brain fog, general feeling of malaise, sleep issues, feeling hot while sleeping. cc"

jamie50513,2016-04-14T19:37+00:00,Anxiety Anxiety Anxiety!!!!,"Hello all, I always say ""one of my worst symptoms is ?"" I can never finish that statement because when i think i've found the worst, here comes another. The one symptom that stayed true and never left (wish my man had the same concept) is this darn anxiety. When symptoms started happening to me overnight I was having panic attacks daily. Since knowing that a little of what may have been going on with me has eased the anxiety enough to where I can try to ride it out and deal with it. But now I am starting to think otherwise. Noticing the patterns as to when my anxiousness comes to the surface. Some of the weird sensations send my anxiety through the roof, the side effects from anxiety is horrible, health anxiety thinking the worst is happening to me, the overwhelming sense of fear, the negative and scary thoughts, agoraphobia, and whatever else comes along with this nasty symptom. I'm always on edge and feeling like I will never have any normalcy to my life anymore. I need to go back to work but don't know if I can handle it. I can deal with the crazy sensations but the emotional dealings I don't think I can handle. I don't want to be put on a bunch of meds I don't need, but I just don't know how much of this I can take. I feel terrible running to the ER or docs office for every little thing, but can't help feeling bad for thinking that i'm ignoring something that may really be serious. I'm at my wits end and feel like I'm stuck. I hate that I will do well for about two weeks and then""bam"" it's back again. When I look around things and people in my life haven't changed. I changed and it's so frustrating to feel like I can't seem to get any resolve. I've been anxious all day, trying to get things done yet frightened and don't know how I'm going to feel from one minute to the next. Sorry for such a long rant, but I just feel lost. o see so many beautiful older women that look fabulous and enjoying retirement, family and doing what they like and can't help but wonder did they transition like this? Will this state of mind ever get better?"

michelle46271,2016-04-20T08:19+00:00,Acid reflux/heartburn,Hi ladies I have heartburn very badly as perhaps you all know from my previous posts. I am waiting for my ENT appointment. I take Lansoprazole twice a day before food. I also take ginger capsules and enzymes. None of this seems to work. As soon as I have eaten it starts to burn in throat and nose. I only eat small meals regularly rather than a big meal and am very careful what I'm eating. I don't drink anything other than fruit teas and water. I don't eat any fatty foods or tomatoes. Only a very slight amount of dairy ie semi milk with porridge in the morning. Any suggestions?
sharcerv52408,2016-04-20T15:19+00:00,What's it like after a total hysterectomy?,"Hi Ladies! I was wondering what it is like after having your uterus and both ovaries removed? Do you still experience the same symptoms associated with menopause afterwards or do the symptoms subside once the ovaries are not there to produce those hormones anymore? I have only one ovary and still my uterus. Last year after a pelvic sonogram and a trans-vaginal scan they found that I have one fibroid on the exterior of my uterus and multiple others internally within the uterus. If necessary I am considering a hysterectomy. I have to go for another pelvic sonogram/transvaginal scan this week to see what my uterus is up to these days; if those fibroids are any larger or what. My last period which ended two days ago was the worst one to date. I had such terrible gas and bloating and bad lower backache. I bled more heavily this time than I have ever done before and I thought to myself if this is a result of those fibroids, I will definitely be opting for a hysterectomy because I do not want to bleed heavily like that every month until I finally go into menopause. Just wondering from those of you who have had a complete hysterectomy, do you still get the menopause symptoms afterwards. Are they any better or are they worse?"

I have had a bleed that lasted 20 days with a 4 day break and the last 8 days were very heavy and clots I am exhausted which I am putting down to blood loss? I suffer with ulcerative colitis and have always had a bloat up and down tummy, but I noticed something strange about my belly button that made me go to my go, who sent me straight for a ca125 and a tv and ta scan. Results were several fibroids a 3.4 cm cyst and a couple of polyps, my gynea said lets do a hysteroscopy and she sent me for the same scan with her guy who said I have no fibroids, no polyps and no cysts no tumours just a condition called adenomyosis . My fear is my ca125 came back elevated( I am sure she said 122) but I was menstruating horribly when I had the blood taken. I believe this can affect the reading? Gynea says she isn't worried ...

jayneejay,2015-04-10T18:53+00:00,Menopause Hot Flush Remedy - Apple Cider Vinegar info,"Apple Cider Vinegar is a good all rounder but quite beneficial for menopause too, its plentyful here in Spain and very cheap to buy..  uselful info ...  Apple cider vinegar helps relieve hot flashes, one of the most common symptoms of menopause. According to a study conducted by the Mayo Clinic researchers found that between 75 to 80 percent of all women in America experience hot flashes. Apple cider offers a really great and effective alternative to women who cannot undergo hormonal treatment or simply want the option of using a natural remedy. In addition, Apple Cider Vinegar aids in the relief of night sweats, another symptom of menopause. Night sweats are occurrences of significant sweating during the night. They characteristically cause perspiration on the upper area of the body, typically the head, face and chest while dampening sleep wear and bedding. Here’s another outstanding benefit of apple cider vinegar, it contains magnesium, manganese, a mineral which supports and maintains bone mass and prevent or lessen the progression of osteoporosis. Wait, there is more to this overall truly awesome health tonic, it supports the body’s absorption of calcium from the foods we eat. Now before you go out and buy the typical supermarket brand you want to head to your local health food store or alternative grocers. The unprocessed Apple Cider Vinegar or unfiltered variety over the processed maximizes the health benefits for menopause discomfort. You want to buy the Organic Apple Cider Vinegar. If you decide you want to give Apple Cider Vinegar a try you should take 2 tablespoons once in the morning and again in the evening. Admittedly, some women complain of the super tangy taste but please don’t let that discourage you. If you want you can drink it quickly straight or add it to a glass of water. So women elect to use a chaser, so to speak, after they take it…such as a small amount of honey, a piece of fruit or juice. By the way, apple cider vinegar is great to use in salad dressings. So there you have it, another hot flash natural treatment that amounts to literally pennies a day for the treatment. Once again we have Mother Nature to thank for the relief! To your excellent health!"

For the last eight months or so I have grown increasingly angry, anxious, depressed and generally feel like Im going crazy. My thoughts can often be negitive or scarry, my vision has become very quickly terrible, blurry and myopic. I dont feel like im sleeping well at night, I get AWFUL anxiety all the time and I keep thinking that Im so old and that Im going to die soon. I had an event that I thought was a heart attack and so did the paramedic who took me to the hospital as my EKG showed elevated ST wave ( a heart blockage) but when they ran many many tests to include a nuclear stress test nothing cardiac was found.  Also I think every little pimple or headace is the big bad boogieman here to get me. I activly fear going to the doctor because Im terrified they will find something terribly wrong with me. Im exhausted all the time and like one of the othe rladies said, I often feel like running away. Out side of well controlled hypothyroid, a binign kidney cyct and fibromyalgia I dont have any other health issues (that I know of yet).

Guest,2016-04-07T00:08+00:00,Post-surgery update - completely unexpected results!,"Hello Ladies... just got home a little while ago after a 10-hour day at the hospital.  For anyone new to my situation, I was supposed to have an ovary removed that appeared to contain some type of mass, in addition to having a couple of small uterine polyps removed.  My doctor ordered lab work on hormone levels and cancer markers that was all normal.  She said that the mass was contained within the ovary and appeared to be solid.  So this is everything we knew going into surgery. Well, I had the surgery today, and guess what... there was nothing in the ovary!!!!!!!!!  I was awake in the recovery room, and extremely dizzy, when my doctor came in with a big smile to tell me.  She explained that I have a benign ""floating"" fibroid outside of my uterus that has been positioned in such a way that it has been pressing on the ovary.  The ovary itself was a yellowish color, not the whitish color that it should be, but she said it was not the color that it would be if cancer was present. However, to be sure, she removed it and a frozen section was done on it that confirmed no cancer. She also removed the two uterine polyps, in addition to a cervical polyp that also turned up, and these are all expected to be benign.  The other ovary has a functional cyst present that she said will be gone in a few weeks.  She also did a D & C as expected.  The pathology results will be back on Monday or Tuesday. I am still in total shock about the ovary.  Since I was so dizzy when she told me, I couldn't process what the doctor told me at all.  After they put me back in my day surgery room with my mom (I was allowed one person with me there), she explained it all to me.  They gave me a pain pill and I slept for about 2 hours and then a nurse with really cold hands came in to wake me up.  I had some juice and crackers, and a couple of cups of water, and after a while they made sure that I could urinate and sent me home.  I'm staying with my family while I recover and they are a huge help. So that is everything for now!  I learned a lot today.  It has been crazy and the outpatient day surgery unit was very noisy, so I am grateful to be home.  I will have a follow-up appointment with the doctor on May 4, assuming that no emergencies or complications arise. Time to rest more now, feeling sore and a bit yucky.  Thanks again for all your support! Elizabeth 💕"

I guess I just want to vent...I'm so tired of these symptoms.  The GI issues and sometimes feeling like I have too much acid in my stomach and other times feeling like there isn't enough.  The muscle aches...it seems like every day I feel like I've pulled a different muscle.  The up and downs with my energy levels and the anxiety, mostly health anxiety.  It seems like I'm constantly worried something is seriously wrong with me.  Every ache and pain brings a new worry.  I've had a full cardiac work up which was all normal except for high cholesterol and long history of high blood pressure.  GI work up all good except for some chronic gastritis, no doubt stress induced, taking meds for it but sometimes wonder if they are decreasing stomach acid too much.  I feel like my body belongs to someone else and I'm tired of worrying about every little symptom.  I hope this is over soon...I'm 55 and tired of this!  Ok...I'm finished venting, lol.   Thanks for listening!"
louise25018,2016-04-09T20:19+00:00,Lower back ache -grrr!!!!,Hi ladies I am writing this evening as for 3 or 4 days now I have had lower back ache and also achcy right hand side that drones on and on. As always I have built this up in my mind and now panicking I have all sorts of things. I got so worried I can't concentrate and ended up crying my eyes out yesterday with worry. I am taking pain killers which relieves it but it's the anxiety! I am so not myself and it also makes me so sad. I had a trans vaginal scan yesterday to check my ovaries which I'm hoping all will be ok for. I also had a urine test recently that had a trace of blood in -although doc said that was normal as us menopausal ladies usually have blood going on somewhere down there. Soon I'm paranoid I have some sort of problem! I'm having a retest once I'm not bleeding (note no periods since Jan this years but my body decided to start one the day before my scan!!!). Sorry ladies -I know some of you have so much more on your plate but I could really do with a little reassurance if pos? Is body aching/back ache general side aches etc another common menopause problem? Why can't I stop worrying?? At night I just toss and turn as I just can't get comfy and my mind goes crazy with what it might be! Thank you for listening and sorry to go on xxxxx
Guest,2016-04-12T13:09+00:00,Day 6 post-op - doom and gloom are back,"Maybe some of you can relate to this.  When I went in for my surgery last Wednesday, and especially after it was over, I felt optimistic, like something was finally getting done about the symptoms I'd been having.  So the doctor removed the ovary and three polyps and smiled at me when she said there was nothing in the ovary after all.  For the next couple of days, I felt better emotionally, thinking ""it's over"" and good stuff like that.  Starting on Saturday, gradually, the doom and gloom feelings have returned, and I woke up feeling sad and teary today.  I know what the triggers are.  I'm waiting on pathology results from the surgery and was reminded yesterday in conversation with my mom that I still have an ovary and my uterus, and a few fibroids.  It is all a feeling of having cleared this hurdle but wondering what if the doctor was wrong and something shows up in the pathology results, or what if something bad turns up in future with the remaining ovary?  My anxiety is through the roof again.  So much has gone on over the last few months to get this far.  I know I need to give myself a break, especially while in recovery."

I have been getting palpitations a day or so before my period is due for about 3 or so years also. As well as this my stomach is very distended, I sometimes feel bloated but I suffer with Ulcerative Colitis and it is exassebated at the time of the month, often if I lie down on my back the bloated feeling is aleviated in wind. but my tummy is still big. So a month ago I strted to do pelvic floor exercises and plank this time My period was a week late lasted about 11 days very mixed sometimes so light and others heavy and dark and clots. My left side close to my ovary is tender my boobs are swollen up and down and tender I have had 3 days no bleeding and just started lightly and red again. I cant wear a coat or a jumper because I sweat and I have to have a fan on at night occassionally I have to open the door and stand outside and in the mornings taking my daughter to scool I am so hot I cannot wear a jacket ( and it is still early April and not ready for casting clothes here yet). I dont feel good my hair is dry and greasy all at the same time I am fat and cnt seem to lose any weight despite dieting. I have an ultrasound arranged for 20 April and had blood tests last Friday. along with my smear test and swab taken. Last year I had a frozen shoulder for 12 months and have had a glorious 8 or so with full movement, now the other side is freezing up! My teeth feel ultra sensative all of a sudden. I am worried I have something sinister going on. If I new it was menopause I wouldnt moan just pray it was over quickly, but I dont now. Can anyone help me, advise me, pacify me or just something me please?"

I never used to experience pain in my Breast during my periods, but now almost each month, just before my period is about to start my breasts are quite painful and feel more lumpy, then all gets normal again. Exactly a year ago I had a mammogram and all was fine. This month my right Breast felt painful for couple of days, and I could feel a lump. It's not there now but this morning there was some discharge from my nipple. I had it once about a year ago, that's when I had the mammogram. It's just very tiny and only when I squeeze the nipple. Has anyone experienced this as a part of the changes in breast due to the cycle or peri-menopause? I have quite bad health anxiety around anything to do with breasts so this is really difficult. I keep telling myself that it's happening just at the time of my period starting so it's pro only hormonal, but it's so hard to calm myself. I cannot Google it because I just would find plenty evidence for the worse case scenarios instantly. I went to the GP who did not seemed to be worried, but I managed to get a referal to Breast clinic in 2 weeks time."

Just been today to the breast clinic and was told I would not need another mammogram as I have just recently had one.

michelle46271,2016-04-05T00:56+00:00,All these peri symptoms have taken away my life,"Hi ladies I know it's late but I feel I have to write something . I am 46 and in a roller coaster at the moment. Been peri for 4 years. I'm at the lowest I've ever been in my life. I can remember November December and January I had such pressure headaches every day,even woke up to them. After that the real depression and doom and gloom. I just couldn't get my head out of it. I've suffered with a big anxiety breakdown 8 years ago due to getting divorced. I found I am frightened sometimes I go out and I've been cancelling appointments. I don't want to join in things when I always loved it . The acid reflux or bile reflux is terrible. I never understood when my grandad had it. I've had my gallbladder out so I don't know which it is. It burns in pit of throat,the worst in the nose. Acid comes into my mouth at night and burns. I just want to sleep,took a sleeping tablet for 3 nights and that didn't knock me out. I've had 3 hours in 3 nights. When I sit down my face and jaw pulsates My jaw is stiff a lot. I pray everyday that the next day will be a good one. I feel like my husband is getting fed up when I talk to him. I want to go places with him again but I just can't do it now as feel so shattered in not sleeping and I have all the symptoms on top 😂"

ellacraig,2016-04-02T19:19+00:00,My Homeopath appointment has helped!,I tried to post before but it was deleted as heaven forbid I mention something that might help but oh well. Anywhow was given to diff remedies. One of which has really helped my sleep. No kidding.  The other cant say it's taken effect yet re digestion but it's only been two days. Am willing to share by private communication if anyone wishes to look into it. That first in one kicked in from day One and goodness sleep is welcomed! Thanks
Guest,2016-04-04T18:34+00:00,Pre-surgery panic,"Well, I'm all ready for the surgery on Wednesday, actually excited to get on with it, but having some last-minute difficulties.  I'm having some kind of sinus attack today, and so far it doesn't feel like a cold, but it is just driving me nuts and of course now I am panicking.  The nurse also called again to say that the doctor got clearance to do the surgery as scheduled, since there had been some question about that with the blood work last week having shown low blood sugar, but the doctor will test my blood sugar again on the morning of the surgery, and of course I can't eat after midnight Tuesday.  I am panicking a lot today, my breathing is shallow and I am praying that nothing will go wrong to delay the surgery.  I have got myself mentally prepared to have it, got my work leave and everything in place, and am just freaked out at the thought of anything not working out.  I really think I'll be okay but this has been a rough day.  Please tell me that I'm not crazy.  Panic is so awful!"

I'm really struggling again, don't know what changes I can make this time and wondered if anyone else has experienced this? X"
shaznay96184,2016-03-22T18:50+00:00,Anyone using PremPak C? What do you think of it?,"Hiya All.  Long time - no post.  Life has just got in the way, which ain't no bad thing where Peri symptoms are concerned. Nothing like a house-move 130mls away from family to take your mind of Peri!! Well I've just finished my second month of PremPak C. Well actually I've Finished Full Stop because for the 2mths I took it, I bled for 22 & 24 days out of the 28 days of those two months.  Not what I signed up for! I said I would probably give HRT a go but I suspect this particular HRT probably wasn't right for me.  I'm so anti-meds in any shape or form, that I didn't want to try a different HRT at this stage.  I think the constant bleeding was just too much, but I knew that break-through bleeds, spotting, and 'Periods' should be expected up to 6mths of use:  sorry that's too long for me. I'll be going back to my Serenity Bioidential Progesterone Cream at the end of this month. I now know that I felt OK when I was using that.  I'm now on a high dose of Vit D(long term) too.  That may do me, for the ol' joints/bones. I think reintroducing oestrogen wasn't so great for me.  I swear this bleedin' stuff BOUGHT ON the sweats, palpatations, PMT symptoms, terrible fatigue, really aching 'Charlies' - not to mention bumping up the weight/mad appetite increase.  I can't say that I'll never go begging my Doc for some other HRT - I have no idea how I'm going to feel at the end of this month, let alone in a year's time.  But, as I told my 2 HRT-loving sisters: I gave it a go, and this stuff didn't work for me, so I'll just keep seeing what works best for me. Be interesting to see if anyone else experienced any of my symptoms.   Believe you me, if I felt really bad, I think I would have asked the Doc to prescribe me a different HRT, but clearly I ain't got it that bad. Having said that, I do hope I don't get much worse than I feel now! Sx"
shaznay96184,2016-03-22T18:31+00:00,"Synthetic HRT...Back on the Bios. Oh well, I gave it my best shot","Hello Ladies - Hoping you are all well and are coping with The Red Devil as best you can.  Haven't been on here for yonks - its amazing how life gets in the way of things, isn't it? Well anyone who may not know my history, here it is as briefly as I can make it ('briefly'?  As if!): ~been in Peri for what feels like a third of my adult life! (I'm now 55) ~at 55 I'm still bleeding as regular as a carefree teenager - there the similarity ends, aside fromt the occasional tantrum and ill-timed zit! ~had a major life change in 2013 - sold business, family home *yawn* long story.  Finally had time for 'Me'. ~Sept '13 - went to see Nurse Practitioner about my Peri symptoms. Got distinct impression she was either completely anit-HRT, or was being MADE to push the use of SSRIs for us nutty Peri-ites!  Prescribed me SSRIs after I joked about being a bit tearful watching 'Don't Tell the Bride' - me and my bleedin' stupid sense of humour! ~SSRIs went in the bin:  just not the route I wanted to take (no offence intended to those who are finding these life-savers: they're just not for me).  Got me reading about my symptoms and alternatives to HRT ~started applying some bioidentical Progesterone Cream (Serenity).   This, along with some Menopace seemed to do the trick ......for a while. ~July '15 - another massive, life changing event. Started process of moving home (130ml away), getting out of London (born & bred: I'd paid my dues etc). ~Moved to new home in a new, unknown county, 130ml from the very small family we have = Our New Adventure. Life's too short etc etc ~Jan 16 - finally went to my new GP after yrs of not having time to be ill. Talked about my Peri. Said maybe I might want to try some HRT. More interested in getting help for my fatigue/aching joints ~Started to take my prescribed, synthetic HRT: PremPak C.  Also got some prescribed Vit D (very low), and possibly going to have some Iron supps (pending more blood tests etc) ~2 mths into a 3-mth course and I've had enough.  Month one: bled/heavy spotting 22/28 days. Month two: bled/heavy spotting 24/28 days.  I don't recall signing up for this!  Read everything about these online and had to give it my best shot, as it stated irregular bleeding etc etc.  ~fed up with the constant Blob, the associated smell, the utter inconvenience of bleeding all the time.  That would have been enough, had it not actually brought on more menopausal symptoms than I had actually experienced pre-HRT!  Today was my Liberation Day - I will no longer be taking PremPak C Synthetic HRT.  Anyone who may have read my older posts will know that I was pretty open minded about Bios V Synthetics = each to their own.  2 of my sisters took it for 15yrs and 8yrs (and still on it).  But I think for me, I could not see any benefits at all, other than maybe feeling a little calmer.  Being a bolshy cow for most of my life, I think i can cope with being a bit, em, challenging:  I think only others may have a problem with that, rather than me! I feel happy to again be almost complete drug-free, having a strange aversion to all-things medicinal all of my life.  I'll willingly take my Vit D supps for the rest of my life, if I have to.  I shall not miss the re-intro of oestrogen into my system, and hope that my good ol' mate Serenity Bioidentical Progesterone Cream (I don't work for them, honest!) will just help me at the tail end of my cycle, and keep those bl**dy symptoms at bay.  I've told the Doc that I may well come crawlling back to him in a few mths, begging for a different HRT, if I cannot get the help I need from my bios.  I just conclude that maybe I haven't got as severe Peri symptoms as I know so many others have. But for me, actually taking something that seemed to bring on the sweats, palpatations, PMT symptoms, really sore and aching 'charlies' wasn't what I was expecting.  Oh, and how could I forget that weight gain/OTT appetite?!! Ladies, keep on doing what's working for you.  I hope that none of you are suffering in silence.  I always loved this Forum as it allowed me to vent my spleen to those who knew only too well what I was moaning about! I continue to have the Dream Husband.  How he puts up with me, God knows (34yrs xx). Has anyone else taken my route of Bio-Synthetic-back to Bio?  To be honest, aside from trying to sort out a massively complex Tax Return, my life is pretty damn good these days, so maybe I'll just be able to go more with the flow and 'get on with it' without too many meltdowns. Just my bl**dy luck, that it takes me to get to this stage, after 42yrs of Ps, before David Cameron felt brave enough to take himself back to the EU to try to get the tax removed from our sannies!   Bit bl**dy Late Dave, me ol' Pal.  I think i alone have been propping up that bl**dy industry alone.  My pals don't call me Kotex for nothing! Chin Up Girls.  We're all in this together, don't forget xx Sx"

Went to hospital late at night last week as it was driving me mad, had it checked and there was an infection which I had drops for and they said there was nothing else nasty going on , nurse did say ear problems are very common in meno but it's horrible. Apparantly the infection has not gone further than the eardrum and I think the actual infection is better, but the ringing and buzzing is still there, worse sometimes than others but I just want reassurance if any other ladies have had similar, health anxiety making me think bad things as usual and it upsets me.

I have been on Zoloft 50 milligrams since then until my last pregnancy few months back I decided to wean off of it and my panic attacks came back very strong to the point where I could not even eat or even take my pill. Ever since June of 2015 I've been struggling with my panic attacks very badly again my electrolytes dropped tremendously but I'm glad to say that they're now back to normal unfortunately I've been having aches and pains everywhere and I mean everywhere. Go to one that has really got to me is my draw on my left side and my arm aching at the same time even my leg they have the numerous EK cheat on me in the past everything comes back normal they have done heart ultrasounds everything comes back normal they practically do blood work every month everything comes back normal but the pain is still there starting like 3 weeks ago I woke up and half of my head was numb as if I had slept on it wrong it went away but I still keep feeling a little bit of tightnes I've also been experiencing a lot of heat on my waist and it's radiating down on my legs and my tail bone area. Doc say it's my anxiety inflammation, spasms or who knows . Unfortunately this really triggers my panic attacks and whenever I'm having these pains it just makes it worse especially the chest pain that is something I've had for years is there anybody out there that has had the same symptoms and everything seems to be okay I really feel like I'm going crazy"

Anyway my most recent symptoms have been waking in the night but not always with a panic attack, instead I have a feeling of absolute impending doom. I started my period 4 days ago, just 19 days after the last one and have noticed my anxiety heightens from day 4 until a few days after it ends now, it used to worsen before my period but now it's shifted to day 4 and beyond. I don't have sweats but I do have facial flushing a lot especially on my period and I have itchy skin a lot. My periods have been heavy for years but now on day 4 it will seem to be slowing down then I will have a very heavy gush, last month I thought I had forgotten to put a tampon in, thanked my lucky stars that I had backed myself up with a pad then got home and realised I had not forgotten and had gone through a super plus tampon and a pad in less than an hour. They have been coming 3 weeks apart for about a year now, I had one or two 26 days apart but as I said this time it was just 19 days. My gp said it might not be reliable to do a blood test because hormones fluctuate so much in the early stages of peri that it might not even show, I may get a second opinion though. Sorry for all the TMI but this is horrible and I am reall trying to work out if the hell I have been in for the past 6 months could be related to it all."

No matter how much research and gain knowledge, I still don't know where to gage anything. Let me recap a little of where I started. 2013 I was 36 years old. My cycles went from 28 days to 23 heavy bleed with clots, gained tons of weight, extremely sore breasts, lots of headaches, insomnia, nightsweats and occasional heart flutters. November 2015 I was 38 years old the cycles stayed the same, lost 20+ pounds, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, weird head pressure, tingling extremities, dizziness, off balance, short of breath, racing heart, internal tremors, dry hair and skin, doom and gloom, moody, rage, internal tremors, digestive issues, chills, night sweats, occasional hot flushes. Now fast forward to now. I have taken a turn. Extremely fatigued (like now I can barely keep my eyelids open), night sweats, really hungry (like right now)(especially for sweets) I've had cake the last two days and today I want rocky road icecream. My cycles are coming 25, 26, or 27 days with very minimal bleeding. I don't know what to think of this anymore. This is the weirdest thing i've ever expierenced. I'm scared to think of what can come next."

ChizBitz,2016-03-29T13:31+00:00,Just need someone to listen and advise,"Hi Ladies, I came across this forum when I was desperately trying to find out how I can get to talk to a human female about post menopause as I have given up trying to talk to my GP surgery about this. I am 50 years old, all I can tell you is that 3 years ago after no periods for 3 months I had to fight to get anyone to test my hormone levels for the menopause.  One female GP told me that having my bloods tested would be a waste of resource as I was too young to be going through it and even if I was ""just get on with it, every woman goes through it"".  6 months later (no period for 9 months and no baby) I asked to speak to my old GP who immediately sent me for a blood test and called me with the results ... yep he told me that I was going through it and that I should be through it in a matter of months.  He offered me HRT but as I had not suffered any bad symptoms I declined it. Since then my joints have ached more and more, my feet hurt in the morning for a couple of minutes and I can't control my weight gain. I saw another GP who suggested that I  ""lose weight and stop carrying heavy items"".  I sit at a desk all day and the heaviest thing I carry is my handbag. I recently went to see another GP as I woke up with the fingers of my left hand curled into my palm and I couldn't open them without a struggle, he has sent me for blood tests for Arthritis. When I asked to speak to him about a different matter i.e. HRT etc. he said ""only if it's quick"". I left. So my question is this .... Where can I find a human female health professional that doesn't expect me to know everything, doesn't want to rush me out the door but who I can sit down with a talk to.

ellacraig,2016-03-28T21:27+00:00,Cant stop Belching this morning :( Woke up again highly,"stressed because hubby was back to work today. Started the morning with a cry and sure enough up ramps my anxiety and the gas starts.. Gawd i even applied for a new  job (full time from my current part time role) in an attempt to distract myself from all my mental chaos. It went really well btw and the guy just rung back and i was too afraid to answer the phone so i didnt!! I just wish all this crap would stop! Here i am applying for jobs and thinking about moving house just because my MENTAL CHAOS.. I keep looking for distractions and anything to keep me from having to be on my own where my mind starts and drives me insane with the health anxiety. I had such a good day yesterday, we went out for the day, i was pretty relaxed and no stupid symptons then today, back to work./school/routine and im all messed up again! My period which turned up early AGAIN and now its day 3 and its pretty much stopped cold turkey when normally it would be pretty heavy, so i cant complain about that but surely its indicative of hormone related issues.. I still get so scared whatever is going on with me isnt hormones, i try the postivie affirmations etc. But many alive this stuff eats away at you.. Snowball i MUST MUST MUST TRY that rhodiola... I watched an interesting article about peri and menopuase and the Dr said the reason women dont handle it like back in the old days is: Adrenal exhaustion/stress, adrenals shut down and dont out put the right hormones.. (something similar) Sugar - we are all consuming too much sugar Soy - anything not organic and fermented is very bad for us and its put into pretty much any process foods (which is true re the foods, i look at the ingredients and theres soy this soy that as addtivies in so much its scary) Exercise - alot of us are living sedentary lifestyles, too much sitting and not enough moving around.

I was wondering if any of you knew of a supplement that is safe to take that helps balance your hormones even though you have uterine fibroids? I keep coming across ones that behave like estrogen and can interact with the fibroids. So I am particularly interested in ones that act as progesterone.

I have found myself very jealous when my partner looks at beautiful women either in person or if he comments on them on TV or online.  Partly I think it's because my usual size 6-8 figure has been transformed in the last 6 mths to a size 10-12 wobbly complete with cellulite.  I hate my body even though he says he loves it.  I always feel he is comparing me to other women and I just can't compete.  It makes me so sad.  He keeps telling me to take HRT and maybe he is right, who knows.

Mostly moody anxious and so on.  I think I've decided (probably what you all already know) is that mostly treating the symptoms as they come up is the best way. For e.g. I don't get hot flashes (yet).  So I am going to try Vitamins and wondered if anyone was interested in my progress?  I am currently suffering from moodiness, tiredness, aches and pains, not sleeping too great, dry itchy skin, crying spells, bloating, indigestion and crashing fatigue.  I am going to start with the following: Vit B6 and B12 for the energy and moodiness. Flaxseed Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, Vit E. Vit C.  I still have to add Vitamin D and Magnesium.  I am not advocating that this is for everyone but thought it might be handy to give feedback?  Also, perhaps open this to feedback for natural remedies that did help you so that others can try perhaps?  I have started yoga and most days I try and walk a mile (at home, I have a video I do). I am also looking into soya too and soya products supplements. Let me know if you are keen to contribute or and get feedback here. Thanks!"

I'm 51 and most likely nearing the end of peri menopause and am wondering one thing today. I know my body quite well, but I'm stumped as to why I've had consistent discharge for over two weeks. I'm very aware of what to look for when ovulating, etc. and also know I'm not ovulating. I'm not menstruating, might be done finally. I've had yeast infections and other sensitivities. The only thing different, is that I started using an Essential oil for hot flashes and they've stopped, but now this persistent mucus has started! Can you please give me a heads up as to what types of discharge are common during this process. I'm only comfortable wearing very loose clothing, if I could go bottomless I would 🙀.

jamie50513,2016-03-23T11:36+00:00,A Little Info,"Hello Ladies, I shared some info in my post yesterday that I think will give you a generalized ideas of what's going on with the hormones. Here is a little info I found along the way. Even though everybody's body is different and peri can last for some years, this may give you an little idea of how far along you may be. FIRST PHASE- progesterone levels decline leaving your body in oestrogen dominance. Some of the symptoms you may expierence is bloating, cramps, mood swings, and tender breast. SECOND PHASE-oestrogen level also declines. Some of the symptoms you may expierence is hot flushes, memory problems, heart paplpitations, migraine headaches, and vaginal dryness. THIRD PHASE-oestrogen and progesterone levels decline to near menopausal levels. Some of your symtpoms may recede at this point. You will still expierence some but will going into your menopausal years. Again, we all are different and expierence a lot more symptoms than what is mentioned but this just gives an idea as to where you may be in the process. ((Hugs)) to all you wonderful and supportive ladies. Thanks for being here."

Here is my question (since I did not use it).  how do they know which hormones you need more of, or is it hit and miss?  They did no hormone count or anything. So one wonders how they actually know what to give you.  I'm scared of HRT and the effects it could have if incorrectly balanced. Isn't this all about balancing hormones. Can I ask to have them measured?  And finally, anyone tried soya products/pills? How did that work out for you? Thanks"

But I am feeling so low today. This is one thing that I haven't really dealt with in the last couple of months. I don't want to believe that I'm depressed but maybe I am. I've been questioning so much since all this has started. I was such a happy person and enjoying life and now all of a sudden I don't know what is going on. When all this madness started about 5 months ago. I didn't know which way to go. Now that some of those symtpoms are gone for now and I finally felt like I was getting back on the path to normalcy, I feel like I'm right back where I started. I have been crying for 3 days now and I don't know why. You would think that since I'm feeling a little better physically that I wouldn't feel so sad. I tried to handle things on my own as much as I could but I don't think I can handle this anymore. I hate that I feel so sad. I am thinking of talking to a therapist and maybe they can help me sort some things out. I've never dealt with anxiety, depression or anything. My family tells me I'm so skinny, I don't look or act the same. I've been so consumed with trying to figure out what is wrong with me that I can admit that I have let a lot of things go. Docs won't help, they tested everything including my hormones and eveything is normal except me being anemic and I'm getting help for that. My cycles are still somewhat regular so they say no peri. I just don't know anything anymore and I'm so discouraged. Sorry for the long all over the place post and I really hate to be a downer. Since I don't have a therapist yet, I just needed to get this off my chest."

Borderline Personality or Just Menopause?,"I was referred to a psychiatrist for symptoms of extreme anger for minor things, nightmares due to PTSD, extreme pain in my feet due to conversion disorder. I told the doctor about the symptoms as well as hot flashes.  I explained that I had stopped taking Premarin and my hot flashes were coming back, but they were not why I was there to see him, my main concern was the anger, nightmares and the extreme pain in my feet.  He prescribed me with seraquel for the anger and nightmares, xanax for my feet since I had already had success with that, and diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder.  But after reading so many peoples comments and experiences on this forum I am beginning to believe that my anger and sleeping problems are just due to the menopause.  Even my therapist was surprised that he came up with that.  Mainly because I am a very independent person and like being alone.  One of the big symptoms of BPD is the need to NOT be alone, to be dependent on others or sometimes anxiety about separation or abandonment.  That certainly does not fit.  She said she would talk to him about it.  My thoughts are that I have been misdiagnosed and now I am on meds that I should never had to take.  I do know that I need the xanax for the conversion disorder until I can somehow resolve that issue, which we are working  on in therapy.  I'm not sure I really have a question or just want to vent, but because I have had other things misdiagnosed in the past it makes me question every thing.  I am guessing that many women are misdiagnosed with mental problems and then take meds that create other problems.  The seraquel makes me groggy, I've gained weight, the hot flashes are almost constant now and I feel less motivated to do things that I enjoy doing. I feel like a mess."

I do get very hot or cold though at times? I am tired most of the time, although I do suffer depression, but the worse part is, I can be hit with the most horrible exhaustion at any given time. Without even being that physical.  It happens a LOT when I go out. Or when I get dressed to go out. It can also just happen at home though. I think I feel it more when I am out since I just need to get the heck home. My partner says I look like a plug has been pulled out of me. Is this peri or the depression I'm so confused?"

jamie50513,2016-03-18T13:21+00:00,Nervous about Hormones testing,"Hi All, I went to a docs appointment yesterday. I had to see a new GP since my previous one no longer accepts my insurance. I was very anxious and nervous because of health anxieties I hate going to the docs. I didn't like my previous GP but used him because all my family uses him. Over all, I was pleased with the visit. She actually listened to my concerns even though she thinks I may need to see a therapist for the anxiety. Stated that she would do a complete blood work up to see where my levels are. I expressed that I wanted my thyroid checked. She stated she was going to check that, my cholesterol, and my hormone levels. My previous GP did not check any of that. She stated she don't like prescribing pills if they are not needed. I am anxious about the hormones. The rest of the blood work I'm ok with as I have had several done in the past few months. I just hate for the hormone levels to come back normal. I feel no one is listening to how I feel and I'm not getting anywhere. I've changed my diet and doing more to help myself but without a doc seeing something on paper they act as if I'm talking like a nutcase when I'm sharing my symptoms. I'm just tired of going in circles and I'm tired of the guessing as to what is wrong with me. I know it's not anything serious from previous visits to hospitals and docs so I'm certain it's hormones but the docs just will not say. Sorry for the long post. I needed to vent."

The last 8 month or so it changed a bit so around day 21?i start spotting for about 4-5 days then have very strong bleed for 3days and then spotting for 2-3 days. Only once I had bleed between periods, fresh blood, 1 day, got checked, all was ok , they only said there was a polyp which I had removed since and a tiny cyst on the ovary which was nothing to worry about. This was 18 month ago, Today couple of days after my period ended, when I was drying mysel there was fresh blood. It really took me by surprise. No pain or cramps. I don't know... Could it be something or is it normal to get fresh blood after period stopped. Getting anxious about it...."

I also suffer from Bipolar, so that really adds to the mix! Plus my son is going through a very tough time with personal issues.  All in all, I am totally overwhelmed I suppose.

Mary1967,2016-03-18T14:15+00:00,MENOPAUSE...DO I REALLY NEED HORMONES???,"Hello. I am 48 and had a TOTAL hysterectomy back in 2012. They removed everything, I have nothing left due to heavy periods causing severe anemia, endometriosis, etc. My ovaries were ""chocolate"" meaning they were very diseased. I feel so much better now with no periods. Post surgery, my OBYN gave me samples of HRT cream/patches because I was to enter menopause instantly...and I took them home with me and even used them for a few days...until I began reading side effects. I quit taking ASAP. My question is...I have not taken ANY hormones of any sort (HRT or bio identical). I have a face flash occasionally and noticed that my hair has gotten a just bit thinner. Do i NEED to begin taking estrogen/progestorone...both or what? I do not want synthetic HRT but would appreciate some advisement. I inquired about BIO IDENTICALS but they are SO expensive. I have not been tested because when i asked my OBGYN if i should get tested, they told me that my levels are going to be low because all has been removed. Should I just keep on not taking anything? Any suggestions? Thank you, Mary"

I've decided to come off them as I don't think they are helping that much as I'm feeling so crap. Getting out of bed each morning is a chore, I've put on a stone and a half in weight, my joints ache, I've no interest in anything, no motivation and I could shut myself away as I've no desire to go out or see anyone. My husband has been fantastic and supportive, even though with my zero libido he's climbing the walls so add a bit of guilt into the mix. I feel he's doing all the giving and getting nothing back and I've just let myself go. Anyway I've just come back from seeing my doctor who I felt had no empathy whatsoever and I'm taking a reduced dose of Hrt for 2 weeks then finishing. Alongside that he's given me a 2 weeks supply of citalopram 20mg as he says my symptoms may be due to depression and not menopause. I'm sitting here not knowing whether to take my first one and totally undecided. Has anyone any experience of these antidepressants who could let me know how they got on? Thanks in advance for any advise."

My Primary care physician told me it isn't perimenopause. I am not sure if I believe her. I google that word and I have most of the symptoms. The only thing I haven't experienced YET is the hot flashes. I literally feel like I'm going CRAZY! I'm only 38, but my mother went thru it around the same age I am now. I'm thinking of going to see an OB/GYN to get a second opinion. I currently have the Mirena IUD form of birth control which is known to stop your periods altogether. This is true for me. I spot occasionally but can't remember the last time I had a full blown period, at least a year. Maybe the IUD triggered the possible perimenopause because of the stopped periods/menstruation? ? Any thoughts or feedback is appreciated from anyone who reads this post. Thanks ~Rachel"

Brevis,2016-03-09T07:40+00:00,Natural supplements,"Hello all.  I know there are some really knowledgeable ladies out there and I wonder if you can help me.  I seem to be progesterone intolerant and since I still have a uterus, can't take oestrogen only which is the only thing which makes me feel human! I've tried the coil which was disastrous for me. I am now back to square one. Without Oestrogen I feel very sic, have terrible headches, vaginal pain and anal pain (I can best describe it as nerve pain). What could I take in terms of vitamins and supplements to help with this? I really don't want a hysterectomy but am really struggling with these peri-menopausal symptoms.  Thanks you so much for any advice! !"

elle127,2016-02-29T21:18+00:00,Help....cant deal with these symptoms!,"Hi ladies, Where do i start? 4 years ago i started HRT and felt great on it. Then i had a scan and found i have fibroids so was advised to come off. Ive been HRT free now for a year. I didnt really notice any problems until a few months ago. Ive always had regular periods but twice now ive started on my 21st day instead of my usual 28/30 days. My most recent period was painful like contractions although the blood is thinner and watery now. The fatigue is horrendous. I couldnt cope and was actually off work and in bed i felt so bad. Long story short.....i went to the doctor who repeated my bloods which again came back as ""normal""!. I know my body and im far from normal at the moment. My doctor said i could go back on HRT to help my symptons but i didnt want to as i would need a HRT which would give me a bleed each month. I want to continue natuarally and see when my periods stop. Has anyone else experienced the painful periods im having and terrible fatigue. I just cant cope like this each month. But i cant stay off work all the time. Any help or advice would be much appreciated. Also suffering with mood swings and bad bloating. Help!! Elaine."

Since all these symptoms started happening to me, the last thing on my mind is sex. I feel so bad because my partner has been so patient and understanding through this chaios. He has been trying to to go out and be intimate and I have been avoiding him when it comes to that. I think he is catching on. I feel extremely bad do avoiding him but I'm just not ready.

Daisy03,2016-03-10T07:36+00:00,Multivitamins,"This is a general question and I am not after advice on certain brands and don't want to promote any. But I have only realised recently that I am going through peri, and found my answer to many aches and pains..... Would it be useful to try multivitamins? When I had my daughter 6 years ago, I was 40 and my hormones were over the place for a long time. I've probably started peri then. I was so desperate and kept asking doctors to check my hormones they haven't and said it wouldn't show me anything significant! Anyway, my husband suggested multivitamins and they helped. The doctor said it was likely to be placebo effect and that I had issues with anxiety and was healthy otherwise. I feel now similar to how I felt then and wondered about going back on multivitamins. My question is what type? Do I try just general ones or do I try some specifically for meno?"
