jayneejay,2014-08-04T10:21+00:00,66 Peri menopause / Menopause Symptoms you may experience which may help some ladies,"SIXTY-SIX PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS: Part one 1 - 49 These are very real physical changes and conditions. Some symptoms alarm a woman that she may be suffering from a serious disease. Perhaps you know the more common ones related to menopausal symptoms in this list. But many of these may surprise you, as they have not been typically associated with this normal physiological transformation.  1. Change in Menstrual Cycle, Cycles may get closer together or farther apart, lighter and shorter in duration or much heavier, lasting longer than one has been accustomed to. Menses may seem to take forever to begin with dark spotting for days until you actually flow, or you might feel like you have your menses every two weeks. 2. Menstrual Flooding can come on with sudden onset and feel like you may hemorrhage to death. Or it can be a gradual build up just when you think your menses will end and you start gushing for days. Flooding commonly accompanies the woman with uterine fibroids as she transits into menopause. 3. Headaches, Migraines, especially before, during or at the end of your menses debilitate and radically interferes with normal functioning. 4. Decreased Motor Coordination, Clumsiness, almost begins to make the woman who experiences this feel like she is certainly less than graceful during perhaps an already awkward period in her life.  5. Lethargy, a persistent feeling sluggishness physically and mentally, that seems to negate ones ability to do much.  6. Physical Exhaustion , and Crushing Crashing Fatigue that can come on so suddenly and grip you into feeling like you will collapse unless you stop this instant. 7. Exacerbation of any Chronic Illness or Existing Condition transpires as hormones decline or deviate from their normal balance. 8. Insomnia, this includes a new or unusual pattern of either difficulty falling asleep, or dropping off to sleep for a few hours and then awakening with the inability to return to sleep. 9. Sleep Disturbances sometimes are from nightmares, night sweats, or just a vague sense of restlessness keeping you up or disrupting your precious revitalizing retreat from this realm of responsibilities. 10. Night Sweats often begin between a woman?s breasts, initially a night or two before her menses, waking her from sleep, later more profoundly disturbing with up to total body saturation, followed by damp or sweat drenched chills. 11. Interference With Dream Recall interrupts the sense of normal sleep, if you are someone accustomed to vivid or at least some detailed memory of your dreamtime.  12. Muscle Cramps can occur anywhere in the body from legs to back to neck, and sometimes reflects the need for more calcium, or simply that your progesterone levels are too low.  13. Low Backache often worsens before or during menses, but if your hormones remain at low levels, you can experience it on a regular basis. 14. Gall Bladder Symptoms of pain, spasms and discomfort felt in the right upper abdominal quadrant under the ribs, which may be accompanied by belching, bloating, and intolerance to certain foods reflect the increased liver load with declining hormones.  15. Frequent Urination, or sensations that mimic urinary infections is a disturbing symptom often unrelieved by actual urination. It is often experienced as the sensation of needing to urinate all the time, even immediately afterwards. 16. Urinary Incontinence, the uncontrollable and spontaneous loss of urine, or the Urge for Incontinence, can occur suddenly or feel continuous, and not only in response to coughing, sneezing, jumping or running.  17. Hypoglycemic Reactions happen when suddenly your blood sugar crashes and you must have food now. 18. Food Cravings, often for sweets or salty foods, but can include sour or pungent foods.  19. Increased Appetite, especially at night and after dinner contributes to that unusual and unwanted weight gain. 20. Dark Circles Under Eyes can also be caused by adrenal exhaustion and thyroid dysfunctions, but no amount of sleep seems to eliminate it.  21. Joint and Muscle Pain, Achy, Sore Joints, Muscles and Tendons, which sometimes develop into actual carpal tunnel syndrome, or give rise to the questioning of other disease possibilities. 22. Increased Tension in Muscles demonstrates itself in those hunched up shoulders as you work or talk about anything uncomfortable, along with promoting lower back pain and a stiff neck. 23. Increased Hair Loss or Thinning anywhere on body, including your head, armpits, pubic area. 24. Increase in Facial Hair especially under your chin, or along your jaw line. It may be defined by generalized hair growth, or a specific and coarse single strand of hair that pokes out, even curls.  25. Unusually Hair Growth, around Nipples, between Breasts, down your back, places where your hair was finer, less coarse. 26. Acne, quite disturbing to any woman who dealt with this in adolescence and never thought it would recur.  27. Infertility causes grief in the woman who postponed pregnancy in her earlier years and now wishes to conceive, carry to term a healthy baby, and discovers she is unable to do so.  28. Loss of Breast Tissue begins with the decrease of progesterone production. Women often feel as though their breast have become empty sacs devoid of their normal fullness, with or without sagging. 29. Breast Soreness/Tenderness/Pain/ Engorgement and swelling, occurs particularly a few days to one week before bleeding actually begins, which usually potentiates complete relief of any pain or swelling. 30. Painful, or tender nipples have been described as this exquisite localized pain only in the nipples and suggests estrogen excess.  31. Cold Extremities feels quite strange especially in the presence of a hot flash, the combination of which is not impossible. 32. Being Accident Prone, bumping into things, not even realizing it until the bruise reveals itself later and then lacking the ability to recall the causative incident feels perplexing and a little scary at the prospect of something more damaging.  33. Hot flashes initially may be described as mild to severe flushes of heat waves, and for some women these evolve into intense outbreaks of sudden heat with sweating and turning bright red all over.  34. Loss of Sexual Energy, our Libido, can be marked by a gradual or sudden disinterest in sex, to the development of an actual aversion.  35. Painful Sex often described as if one?s vagina would tear open at the point of penetration along with feelings of abrasion during intercourse. 36. Vaginal Dryness, Irritation, sometimes accompanied by a consistent unusual discharge - typically odor free, negates a woman?s ability to be sexually active, or able to enjoy or be comfortable in her body. 37. Dizziness, feeling lightheaded and the loss of physical balance, and even a bit wobbling at times, requires pause in movement to prevent falling over or deepening into vertigo or feeling faint. 38. Ringing in the Ears, Tinnitus, can be experienced as a pulsing sensation, a whooshing sound, an almost musical or buzzing sound with a fuzzy sensation. 39. Abdominal Bloating comes on suddenly often after eating, or seems to be all the time, and can be visibly evident making you feel that you look like you are pregnant.  40. Weight Gain disturbs most women, particularly when it seems to happen over a couple of days, settles in the waist, buttocks and thighs, promoting a visceral thickening from the waist down, the classic middle-aged figure. 41. Fluid Retention, Edema, commonly with swelling in the legs and ankles, though not limited to this area and it is unrelieved by urination. 42. Palpitations or Heart Racing usually comes on suddenly, without warning or provocation, and dissipates spontaneously. The experience can be so wild and intense that a woman may become alarmed and wonder if she is having a heart attack.  43. Irregularities in your Heart Rate may feel more like your heart has just done a flip-flop or skipped a beat. 44. Constipation/Diarrhea, intermittent or alternating, results from declining hormone levels, which increase the demands on liver function and alters intestinal motility. 45. Tendency towards Candidiasis can increase, even if you have no prior known history ? and if you do, it may worsen. 46. Gastrointestinal Distress, Increased Flatulence, Unrelieved Gas pains, Indigestion, Nausea all can reflect intestinal changes due to hormonal imbalances. 47. Slow Digestion often goes along with the bloat ? what previously took four to five hours to digest, now seems to take all night. It seems worse in the evenings. 48. Lack of Appetite may be experienced as more of a lack of interest in food, going to the frig and standing there with the door open and staring blankly. Feeling completely uninspired, you busy yourself with something else and forget that you need to eat. 49. Changes in Body Odor especially disturbing when it seems to focus in the groin area, but can be anywhere on the body. 50. Puffy Eyes, not only from sleep disturbances, but also can accompany low progesterone. 51. Facial Pallor alternating with Facial Flushes is often intermittent with hot flashes. 52. Flare up of Arthritis worsens with low progesterone levels and increase sugar intake. 53. Loss of Bone Density, Osteoporosis, is not only an elderly woman?s disease, though it seems to develop over an extended period and is triggered by the decline of hormone production. 54. Dry Hair, Change in Skin Tone, Integrity, and Texture, becomes more wrinkled, and may begin the thinning process. 55. Changes in your Fingernails characterized by easy breakage, bending, cracking and getting softer. 56. Itchy, Crawly Skin with a strange sensation like insects crawling around under the skin ? quite different than the dry skin feeling. 57. Muscle tone seems to slack and sag, and loose its previous response to normal exercise. 58. Pelvic Pain can be random and independent of cycles and may feel continuous for some women. 59. Dry, Itchy Eyes felt in the deep posterior aspect of the eye socket, as well as superficially. 60. Teeth Aching or the experience of a strange sensation in one?s teeth or gums, often accompanied by an increase in bleeding gums. 61. Change in the normal Tongue sensation, which can be accompanied by a feeling of burning in your tongue and roof of mouth, malodorous breath or change in breath odor, and/or a bad taste in your mouth. 62. Memory Loss or Lapses in time, makes one feel disoriented and less focused, especially when you go into another room to get something specific and seconds later cannot remember what you went to retrieve. 63. Feeling Faint for no known reason (this does not include standing up too quickly) 64. Tingling in Extremities not only feels weird and like your hands or feet are falling asleep, but if persistent can be a symptom of diabetes, B12, potassium or calcium deficiency, or a compromise in blood vessel flexibility. 65. Sensation of Electrical Stimulation,or Shock occurring in the tissue under the skin, and may signal you that a hot flash will begin. 66. Increase and worsening of Allergies occurs as hormones become imbalanced, so can our immune system."

Have you ever felt as if someone has been pricking/is pricking you with pins, during ANY of these menopausal journeys?

Doctor stated that this is a natural process women go through when getting to menopause, some of these hormone therapists have some disadvantages because our body differs.

cindy17746,2020-10-04T07:17+00:00,Feeling like I’m dying; no one understands,"Hi! I came on here tonight because I just finished a third day in a row of being in bed, so sick I feel like I'm dying. I have terrible sleeps, terrible nausea, stomach troubles, anxiety, etc. The last three days, my muscles have been so weak, I can barely move. And at the same time, it feels like they're buzzing with electricity. This forum helps me cope. No one understands this experience like you ladies, and I feel judged by my female friends who are having an easier time and who think this is all in my head. I get really distressed when I have days like this, and my friends think I'm overreacting. It's a time in life when women need to support each other, which is why this forum is great. So thankful for it."

Me, I feel like I don't have any energy left to continue fighting it, my life has been buried in a deep hole with no way out, every day I have to endure endless hot flashes. Every time I have hot flashes, my whole body feels like it has low blood pressure and my heart beats very fast. I get headaches and dizziness at any time. Every day I live in fear and panic, not knowing that I have a disease. Is it some kind of cancer? For the past 6 months I have cried every day and then quit all my jobs, I don't know when these horrible symptoms will leave my body so I can get back to life. As usual, I was too tired and completely exhausted"

kate78592,2024-02-26T08:19+00:00,Am I too young to have perimenopausal symptoms,since i was about 38 ive had brown discharge around ovulation and regular periods when i was 40 i went the docs because my period didnt come for 6 weeks! very unusual for me. i put it down to stress. the next two periods were around 35 days apart and then just became normal again (still with brown discharge at ovulation) i began then having this heat that just came out of nowhere from my chest a few times etc i have night sweats but id put that down to anything else. that seems to have stopped now last month i wiped during ovulation and proper red blood was there not my usual brown i contacted my nurse and they again put it down to perimenopause my early 20's i had CIN 3 cells on my cervix burnt away i worry that im too young to be starting perimenopause. but the nurse isnt bothered about the CIN 3 i had when i was young and the fact ive been spotting for nearly 4yrs is this perimenopause? is it normal to have a really long cycle for a couple of months then just back to normal? is the spotting normal since 38yrs ish im now 41 im also not on any contraception
molly54321,2016-08-16T22:58+00:00,Menopause and paresthesia?,"I would love some input on my strange symptoms.  I'm 50 years old. For many years, my periods have been very close together, very long, and with 2-3 days of exceptionally heavy flow. I know this weird period stuff is normal in peri menopause. Then, after one of these ""normal"" (for me!) periods in April, I didn't have one for 60 days - and when I did it again, for the first time in years I didn't have the heavy days. That was over 60 days ago and so far I haven't had another one since. My FSH level in a blood test two weeks ago was very high - 117. I tell you all this just as a little background - I already know I'm obvioulsy in peri menopause and nearing actual menopause.  But here's the reason I'm posting. Starting mid-May, all of a sudden I started having very consistent paresthesia in my feet and legs - a mixture of tingling, pins and needles, slight burning, static sensation outside skin, pricking... no numbness. It has been with me every single day since then - 3 months now. It's worse at some times than others, but always present to some degree (and usually very annoying and concerning). It is definitely in BOTH legs and feet.  I'm slightly low in B12 and hoped that was the cause - however, after 10 B12 shots over 5 weeks, I have no improvement. I've had various other blood tests, all normal. I had an MRI of my spine (all 3 sections) yesterday and it showed nothing. No MS lesions, no transverse myelitis lesions, no compression/stenosis, no disc problems, no tumors. Now I need to get a brain MRI and of course I'm concerned this one could show MS. However, doctors have told me - and my research confirms this - it would be most unusal for MS to present with paresthesia equally on BOTH sides, stay around consistently for so long without going away even briefly, etc... And I have zero other MS sypmtoms. So assuming (hopefully!) that's NOT what it is, then it's becoming a real mystery. I've done some reading that suggests these weird tingling sensations CAN be caused by menopause - due to extreme hormone imbalance. Also, my hormones could have been out of whack for a long time what with all my irregular periods, AND about 12 years ago I had my hormone levels checked and supposedly at that time I had the estrogen level of ""a post-menopausal woman."" At the time my doc said that was a little odd, but ok, no cause for concern. Anyway, I say all this as a way to say perhaps I've been a little bit of a unique case as far as my hormones. Does anyone think these symptoms COULD actually be attributed to menopause? Or has anyone had something similar happen to them? I've asked my doctor a couple times and she immediately says no, menopause couldn't cause this. I realize it's not typical, but is it possible? So far I have no hot flashes or night sweats, thank heavens, but maybe this is my own personal type of menopause hell?!  Any insight would be so very much appreciated. Maybe I'm grasping at straws, but it DOES seem an interesting coincidence that all these issues have come up right as I'm going through this different timing in my periods, obvious continued hormone changes, etc...  Thanks in advance for any help people might be able to offer. I think I'm going insane. If this could be blamed on menopause, I would be SO relieved and could deal with it!!!"
laura370,2018-08-15T22:36+00:00,Extreme Jealousy!!!,"Omg...I am driving my husband mad with imagining that he's looking at everything and anything and comparing them to me. I am like...Am I going out of my mind??? I know some women will say well maybe your instincts are right. Well, to squash all those that think that I will say that I've been married to this man for 30 years and NEVER even felt like he gave anyone (including women) a second look. I've even encouraged him in the past to give the girls in his office a little something around Christmas to show his appreciation because he would never think of it. Now I'm constantly having these paranoid thoughts of him staring at other women. I feel INSANE!!!! Is it my insecurities and my age (I'm 52) that all of a sudden is making me crazy?? He has never said anything negative about my body or my looks and compliments me all the time. SO WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON? He asks me if I'm trying to push him away by accusing him of this and I am not at all. I love him dearly and he tells me he loves me everyday. But this green monster is taking over my life to where I'm imagining him ogling anything that moves. UGH!! Please tell me I'm not the only one that feels this craziness. <3 <3 <3"

lamanp,2024-02-16T18:06+00:00,Please let me know I’m not a lone 😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢,"I'm 50 years old and my life has completely changed since 5 months, one night I was sleeping as if an electric current went straight into my body And then my whole body became exhausted and my heart beat very fast. I thought I was going to die and didn't know what happened because for a long time I had never thought about what perimenopause was. I didn't have my period for 5 months and then it came back 2 times but until now. Now it's been 3 months without it. After the terrible night, I had to go to the emergency room because my heart was beating fast, I had difficulty breathing, and I was exhausted every day. After testing, everything was normal, but I was very afraid and didn't know if they were missing anything. At that time, my family doctor transferred me to a gynecologist. During the 1-month waiting period for my appointment, I had to fight every day with a body that no longer had enough energy, I was depressed and exhausted. cry every day, have insomnia at night, every time I have hot flashes my heart beats faster than normal and feel like my blood pressure has dropped, every morning I wake up with no energy in my body, headaches, dizziness , I don't have enough strength to do anything, I'm exhausted and have no energy to take myself out, I don't want to see anyone and want to talk to anyone, finally the day of the appointment with the doctor The doctor also came, I cried a lot to her and begged her to save me. After I had my blood drawn and everything tested, she finally gave me the results: I was in the stage of death. I was in perimenopause and my hormones were too low, I sat there and cried a lot, I felt like I was dying every day with a weak body and no energy left, in the end I was treated with the lowest dose of HRT for 3 months. She said that if I was still not feeling well within three months, she would then increase the dose to a higher dose. Currently, I have been using HRT since January 26, but until now Now I still don't see the results. My family doctor gave me more antidepressants and tranquilizers to help me feel more stable, but I don't dare to take it. I really want to be stronger to overcome it. going through this terrible period but I can't do it, so many bad things keep clinging to me every day, every day. For me, it's like being in a living hell, I find my life deadlocked, tired and very tired, my last hope is that HRT can help me return to normal life, I also don't know when HRT will have results, I thought I was suffering from some incurable disease. I really live in fear and madness, please let me hug you tight so I know I'm not alone."
caroline62395,2021-10-21T20:12+00:00,Feeling better all the time,"Hi, I have not posted on here for a very long time, the reason is I have felt so much better and forgot all about it, which I assume happens to many people. At my worst moments I was always looking for positive posts that would give me some light at the end of the tunnel but could never find many. Its like anything else when we feel better we just get on with living. I am now 51 and have not had a period for over 4 months, I still get very warm at night and don't have the best nights sleep but I have gone back to work and I'm loving it. My anxiety levels are just about back to normal except for the odd few times I have the familiar dread feeling but it soon passes. I think I'm a bit grumpy sometimes and have a low tolerance level but I can live with that. The days of been so terrified to even go shopping or to any social event are gone, I don't even think about it now. I am crossing my fingers that this is how its going to be now. I feel older, look older but I'm ok with that. Please hang on in there, I know its not always the case for everyone but hopefully a lot of us do get through this, a bit battered and bruised but there is light at the end of the tunnel."

charcey97,2024-02-18T18:30+00:00,"Left side numbness and tingling, hot flashes, headaches, dizziness- oh what fun!","Hello fellow peri/menopause sufferers- Curious to hear your stories... I just turned 49. I have had the standard peri adventures for the last 6 years. Nothing super crazy. Hot flashes off/on, insomnia, speech and memory issues, Had another couple episodes in that four month period. Again, just shrugged it off. The last one was in early January and I finally decided to go get it checked out. Dr. Has run more than a few blood tests which of all come back normal and I have a brain MRI scheduled for this Tuesday. Starting three weeks ago, I experienced headaches, severe hot flashes.-anywhere from 5 to 10 a night, increased speech, and memory issues, noticing some eye strain/blurriness, muscle weakness, and numbness/tingling in extremities- mostly on the left side. Needless to say, I am doing the best I can not to freak myself out. It concerns me that everything is on the left side for the most part, except the muscle weakness, which is everywhere, but I have read in other areas of this forum that the one side thing has happened for others, as well. I'll know more with my brain MRI, but my ANA was negative. Would love to know if any of you are dealing with the same symptoms that I’ve been dealing with in the last four months. Yesterday, right hand felt different (can't pinpoint how- maybe slightly weaker). Today, I am dealing with slight numbness and tingling (if I can call it that) on my whole left side from neck down to thigh. Kind of feels like overworked muscles or something. Hard to describe, and I’m not sure I can even describe numbness and tingling because it doesn’t quite put the finger on it. Almost feels like it’s asleep, but not really. Hopefully that’s making sense. Thanks for the support ladies."
ShoSho46,2024-02-12T22:16+00:00,Does anyone else have this issue!?!,hi ladies. im just wondering if anyone else has issues with feeling like you cant catch your breath? especially in the morning and after eating. plus the top of my stomach feels very tight along with my ribs. also my tongue is raw and feels dry.
dee28383,2017-12-05T17:22+00:00,Debilitating body weakness and fatigue,"Hello everyone. I am new here and am looking for anyone who may have experienced what I am currently going through. Last year I got my last period ( was in perimenopause for 6 years prior), and a chronic sinus infection at the same time. After a quick decline in health over the following 5 weeks, I woke up one morning to have all the energy and strength sucked right out of me. It was so scary!! I had many that's, all show no health issues so far. I have improved alot since then ( though it was pretty hell), and now I am in full menopause since I have been period free now for 16 months. I am 46 and never had health issues before. I am getting my hormone levels checked out next week. I was just wondering since this infection and last period happened at the same time..could this have caused my huge crash in strength and fatigue? Any insight would be appreciated. I am losing my mind trying to cope and also figure out what happened."
Jodieboo,2024-02-15T20:52+00:00,Perimenopause experience and thanks for how this forum helps me.,"I am a self-confessed hypochondriac, have been for life. I have clung to forums such as this, for a lifeline in my darkest moments and thank you, to all of you whose comments have got me through. Forgive me this post will be long and I mean llllllloooooooonnnnnnnggggggg. BUT, one of the worst aspects of the perimenopause for me has been the sheer terror of an increasing number of symptoms – some in themselves debilitating, coupled with my fluctuating belief that I am terminally ill because until finding shared experiences, I had no point of reference. If one person reads this and it fits and it stops them from living in hell, then that’s a win. Saying that I am not a doctor, and whilst my experience may mirror some or all of your symptoms you do still need to get confirmation that what you are feeling is as a result of being perimenopausal. I am only writing this post after having tests to confirm that I am perimenopausal and tests that ruled out other nasties. I am 50, this has been going on for probably for the last 4 years, but only recently have I joined the dots! That’s maybe because it started slowly, I was just getting an increasing number of symptoms in the week leading up to have a period and steadily the lead up period extended and then spread to after a period until eventually I were was to single figures of symptom free days and then even they abandoned me. Mother Nature or whoever is in charge decided to open the flood gate!! I know the perimenopause is dire, I really do and I am in no way trying to dimmish the impact but the following is written with a degree of humour as despite all of this crap humour is a bit of me that I retain and recognise and I will not let this stage of my life steal that as well. This is written on a ‘good day’. I retain all the symptoms below – I have just started on HRT which has been changed today as it appears that I am intolerant of Progesterone, strange I don’t even know him. My symptoms are below – this isn’t an exhaustive list, I am sure I can find more but these are ones that cause me most discomfort, pain, distress and/or anxiety: Constantly feeling like I have an incurable, terminal condition. This aside from being debilitating, leads to and exacerbates many of the following other fun symptoms. Anxiety – oh I was always a bit of a worrier, glass half full and that sort of thing. Not on the same scale as what it became. Glass half full went to empty, went to smashed against a wall and walked on with bare feet – or to put it better all-encompassing anxiety and that means that you cant have a cheerful or happy thought whilst the darkness reigns. Throw in panic attacks for good measure and you can be floored - quite literally. Heart palpitations/rapid heartbeat – these are absolutely darlings aren’t they. Suddenly, with no warning or trigger you can feel your heart when previously you just contentedly accepted it was there. Not only can you feel it but you get to experience its every beat. Its not the normal heartbeat sound effect that you hear in movies. Oh no, its going at 2000 mph and it’s bursting out of your chest. Well, its not but it feels like it may – I have expected to have to chase mine on many occasions. Do you know the extra bonus? – When you can feel your heartbeat racing ahead like Redrum – you often get to feel/hear it stop or miss beats – nah it doesn’t but it feels that way and you may be just reaching for the defibrillator as you notice it ticking away again. OMG is it scary!! Tinnitus / pressure in ears – oh please give me noises in my ears all day, every day until you get bored. Make the noises annoying and please make sure that no matter what I try to do to stop the racket nothing works. Add the feeling that you get when you put your tabs underwater – I get that minus the water. Feeling weak – not just tired but done, heavy arms, heavy legs weak – like your body is so drained and without strength that it cannot possibly do your bidding. All of this whilst being fully capable of continuing to walk and bend and lift – but it doesn’t feel that any of these tasks will be possible. I can sit on the sofa looking at the kettle in the kitchen and be desperate for a brew however what it feels like I am facing is Everest, complete with snowy peaks but without the kit or support team. Feeling dizzy/off balance– sometimes the room will spin, sometimes you feel faint – the radiator in the bathroom that you know is on the wall in front of you is now spinning and putting itself in the bath or you feel so lightheaded that you are ‘furniture walking’ for security. Feeling that you’re not so much walking in a straight line but ‘pin balling’ from side to side. Am I, no I don’t think so, but it certainly feels that way. Impending doom – yep there looks like there is no prospect of pleasant things ever again in the future in fact you are convinced that something bad and I mean BAD is just over the horizon. The Grim Reaper appears to have become your internal voice and my goodness is he persuasive. Constantly feeling unwell – the culmination of symptoms and the accompanying difficulties and sheer exhaustion means that there are commonly few good days – sleeping (if you sleep) is merely pausing to repeat. Not feeling normal – no I do not! Most days I don’t recognise my aged self and I certainly don’t feel normal, in fact I feel a million miles away from me and the worst thing is that most of the time I can’t even articulate why or even what I am feeling/experiencing. Agoraphobia – nope, I don’t want to go out – I don’t feel confident or comfortable enough. I don’t want to see people; I don’t want to make the effort that is required to achieve this. I want my bed, my quilt and pillow and for someone to gently wake me up when it’s all over. Dental – my teeth have moved by about 3mm. I have gaps where I didn’t have gaps and happily now an accompanying whistle whistle when I talk as a result - massive confidence booster I find. Peri fun? No, it’s just not. Being strangled – I am not! My other half has faults however not of the murderous variety. I know I am not being choked but it doesn’t stop the feeling and on some days I cannot bear anything near my neck because it will have become animated and it will be reaching out its sticky cotton filled fingers in its latest attempt to take my life. Lump in throat/food getting stuck – yep get that too, admittedly not that often but I feel that the accompanying difficulties in getting the stuck food to move with the accompanying sweat are a long way from attractive – equally the wide eyed fearful look that I am sure I display each time it happens is not going to achieve me a wider social circle. Leg heaviness – they are heavy and that’s because they are made of jelly. Am I walking or am I just heaving my legs behind me because they now weigh 17 stone each? My brain doesn’t control them, they go where they want to. Yes and no, they feel that way but in fact they are still behaving perfectly normally and continue to follow the beaten track. No energy – I used to be so active – DIY, hobbies, badminton, walking – not now, feel free to do those things and happily tell me how its gone but please don’t expect me to join in. My energy reserves enable me to wake, work and sleep – that’s it. Chest tightness/breathing issues – oh yes, this feels like my asthma that has always been controlled without any real issue. Now it feels anything but controlled. Does it have triggers like asthma commonly does? No of course not this is the perimenopause and it smacks you in the chest when you least experience it. Random shooting pains – oh they are everywhere and for no good reason however just to make sure that I am paying attention, I will get them in my head which must equate to a stroke (it doesn’t) or in my chest which must be the much anticipated heart attack (it isn’t). Intrusive weird thoughts – if you worried before the peri comes and smacks you up the side of the head with a cricket bat, then brace youself – add in thoughts that you would never normally think, that don’t even feel like they originate from you. Add in a pinch of doom and a smattering of absolute unreality and you will see proportionate responses leave rapidly by the back door. Memory issues – almost forgot this one lol. Yep, I went from having a fully functional army of synapses, who had been exercised to competition level only to wake up one day and realise that most of the conscripts had left via my ear hole and my memory had been reduced to the strength, consistency, and sustainability of a chocolate fire guard. Yes, I still recognise my Grandson, but I will flatly deny any conversation we have had because my brain decided it wasn’t important and deleted its content and unlike Microsoft Word there is seemingly no undo button. I will continue to recognise you providing you look as you did 5 years ago and make no changes. If you ask me to do something - do it by text, phone, email with 15 minute reminders or ask someone else, because I will not have a clue. Intolerance / rage – oh yes my patience and humanity can seemingly leave my body and leave me a murderous husk – out of character – oh just a bit I am Mrs Tolerant and patient and I have no idea where that bit comes from or why but I do now have a basic idea of red mist and the last time it was experienced with murderous intent was when the roasting dish didn’t fit in the dishwasher – rational/proportionate – absolutely not!!! Brain fog / lack of concentration – mid sentence of the most crucial part of my story, the interesting bit aaannnnddd, no, sorry its gone! Its gone and it’s my story – HOW!! Staring blankly at a monitor, with no clue what I am doing or even where to now start from, in fact it can change to the screensaver and I wont notice. Tottling off with purpose and intent – get there and why am I there? No idea and this is the bit where I retrace my steps (if I can remember them) to the place where I was when I decided to go where I have just been in the hope that the purpose of the original trip reoccurs to me – does it? No in fact by the time I have got back to the beginning, I typically don’t know why I have gone. Having to think about the sequencing of routine tasks – right the lid of the tin is off the dog food – what’s next oh yes the fork, oh hold on there, where’s the bowl etc etc etc. I am now the proverbially well-behaved dog in the park walking genially by your legs until SQUIRREL! Pins and needles / weird sensations / numbness – yes there is no where near enough going on so routinely please give me random and painful pins and needles, add a bit of creepy crawlies under my skin and then put the cherry on the cake and tell me that bits of me are now in fact numb – at this point I give the offending bit of me a hard pinch only to find that surprise, surprise THAT HURT and that the numbness is just another peri treat. Shaky and clumsy – yes I know the sofa is there but randomly and with no intent I will walk into it. Not gymnastically somersaulting over the arm as you would expect from high impact collision just seemingly poor cornering and the fact that spatial awareness is now an elusive little chappy. Cold feet – where did they come from – they’ve always been warm – I’ll take that – get rid of the other charming effects of peri and I will retain the feet of ice. Weight loss – yes I had the opposite to the weight gain cited in many peri/menopause stories. I had just enough weight loss to make me self-diagnose cancer and with my anxiety and differing pains – I got to pick it being in a different organ almost daily. However, considering the lack of energy I had that meant that I really couldn’t be bothered to do more than pour hot water into instant oats once a day – is it really a shock? – me thinks not. Appetite – no I haven’t got one however throw in someone who cooks a meal I then follow the aroma of like the Bisto kid and I am ravenous and eat every bit. Digestion & indigestion & reflux & nausea - after every meal with reflux, a ‘lump’ in the stomach from anxiety and bloating to the point that it wouldn’t surprise me if I had a valve in my ribs and an Imp with a foot pump and a smile. No I don’t have IBS but I might as well have because at different times throughout the month, I can probably tick every symptom. There is nothing, absolutely nothing that finishes off a good meal like a Gaviscon pudding or chaser! Well there is but Gaviscon is now like life’s milk itself, sent by angels to combat whatever is going on in my belly and associated bits and bobs. I have nausea that I can set my watch by its starts at 8pm and lasts for the next 2 hours. Twitching face – oh the joys – give me twitches and please ensure that you make them on my eye or mouth so that when I do venture out I appear that I am smiling/winking without any reason to do so – it probably doesn’t look so severe – I have never been quick enough to the mirror to check but my word have I tried. Chronic tiredness – in bed by 7pm and that feels a stretch and it would probably be earlier but that’s the grandsons bedtime! Detached from reality – I am not, but I feel it, spacey, other worldy – who knows how to describe it but if you have the same sensation you will undoubtedly recognise it. Pain under left rib – ouch, this one hurts and once its there it hangs around and takes a while to go. Sugar lows – I am not diabetic but if I don’t eat regularly enough please make me shake and sweat and feel faint even if I last ate 2 hours ago but my body has forgotten. ACNE – where in the world did that come through – I didn’t have it between 12 and 20 – what is going on. I’ll tell you spots!!! Loads of them and some of them babies is big!!! Some are incredibly painful and even 2 weeks later when the paid disappears you keep the lump that housed it for a good couple of months as if for company. Dry skin – I am so lucky with this – I get this on my nose – regardless of what I do to relieve it, the skin breaks as if chapped and scabs. Therefore for 2 weeks out of 4 you meet Rudolf. Thanks for helping me, hope this helps you x"
sara48909,2024-01-12T11:05+00:00,Positive reason to take HRT????,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this HRT thing. Got my second patch on this morning (first one I found stuck to the bed sheets this morning - got a lot to learn) What I really want to ask is, having spoken to a doctor (well cried at!) and been advised to start HRT, she then talked me through a LOT of negative stuff like risks of cancer, thickening of womb linings etc etc. Then I got the patches and read even more negative stuff about it. What I REALLY need to hear right now is some plus's to using HRT. I need to know this is the right thing to do. Can anyone help?"

Last year I did not have a period for 5 months but at that time I still had no symptoms, after that I got my period again.

sharcerv52408,2024-02-05T13:27+00:00,Heat flashes and migraines,"Hello Ladies! I haven't been on this forum in a while. I hope you all are coping as best you can with your symptoms. I have been post menopausal for one year now and it seems that my symptoms are worst. I had hoped that after my periods ceased that my symptoms would lessen. Yesterday at church, while singing in the choir, I had a migraine flare up. I felt very weak and lightheaded. Thankfully I didn't pass out in front of everyone. I was able to muddle through and make it home. My migraine was triggered by heat flashes. Anyone ever have migraines associated with heat flashes? How long after menopause do the symptoms of menopause start to dissipate? I was hoping I'd be on the other side of all this by now."

I've had breast pain and shoulder pain last couple of months, which caused health anxiety. But since yesterday I have had this bad headache, head pressure and ear ringing (whooshing). I had these symptoms before when perimenopause started. I tried OTC pain killers which helped the headaches. But this time it's making me really anxious. I tried ibuprofen, it helped a little. According to my period app, it's ovulation time so is this another weird symptom related to ovulation. My period has been somewhat regular lately. Is anyone else dealing with something like this? what have you tried that helps with this craziness? I just want to feel like myself again soon. I can't take it anymore."

We all know we have used Dr. Google who has at one time had us all convinced we are dying of cancer as these symptoms are relentless. **I have had the wacked out periods (last one was a year ago and blood test show I am POST-menopausal) **I have had the nausea, could not eat, lost weight **I have had the brain fog **I have cried and still cry for no reason **I have flown off the handle for trivial crud **I have had the belly cramps **I have had the deep muscle (scapula) shoulder blade pain (I am right handed and do a LOT of computer work) so I am sure that does not help especially being I sit like a pretzel **I once loved Christmas but can't wait until it's gone this year.

Do any of you have like a tender throat (not sure if that spot has anything to do with it) but seems odd it's all on my right side with sharp ear, jaw and neck pain? I have been Googling all kinds of head/neck/throat cancers and although I have ""some"" of the symptoms Dr. Google has me once again convinced this is something more than menopause cuz why would our hormones have anything to do with this right (lol).

shylee,2019-04-13T11:36+00:00,Am I alone?? Perimenopause so bad i've been hospitalized.,"It's a very long story but I will try to keep it shortened. I am now 49 just about to turn 50 but this has been going on for years. i remember the yrs of itching skin like ants crawling and biting, then suddenly it disappeared and i didn't think of it again. It started in 2013 I had been getting severe electric like shocks in the top/ back of my head, so painful my legs sometimes buckled. it was fleeting so i never saw a Dr. then started to get a numbness in my left ear which would also disappear. The head shock hit hard one afternoon and again gone. i went to bed that night and woke with a completely dead left arm, feeling came back but it was never the same. i went to the drs i had CT scans, nothing. I was referred to a neurologist. while waiting. I was hit with severe neck pain, body pain, numbness and burning on the left side of my face and arm. then i was hit with severe hot flushes that were more like waves of fire, none stop. Then i was hit with what felt like a severe ongoing UTI (no infection) Migraines, vertigo, burning mouth, anxiety through the roof, insomnia... I was and am in so much pain but Drs weren't listening to me. eventually i was put on HRT and hot flashes settled but nothing else. I had MRI blood tests etc for MS, Lupus etc results came up nothing... so i have been treated like a mental patient. I am sorry to say that i fulfilled their assumptions of me when i could take no more and overdosed. I was in hospital for 5-6wks. Since then i have been put on Carbamazepine to stop the burning sensations which it has, in combination with duloxetine for anxiety and pain and metazepine for insomnia and combo for pain plus pain relief panadiene forte as well as the HRT. My Dr has told me flat out perimenopause and menopause do not cause pain (Dr is male) i have no other dr to go to in my town. I feel very alone as no one i know not even family members have or are suffering as I am. Is there anyone out there like me? or am i truly alone in this?"

Gonzozo,2024-01-24T01:15+00:00,Is this the beginning of the end!,"Hiya, I am 47 years old and have had what I think are early peri symptoms for maybe a couple of years, maybe longer as I wasnt paying too much attention! I am now feeling that things are beginning to change more noticeably now. My list of symptoms are Chronic Fatigue (although I cant seem to go to bed before 1am!) Palpitations Loss of appetite Loss of libido, to the point of being repelled! Frozen shoulder for about 4 months, exercises from Physio helped. Headaches, used to get once in a blue moon now it's every week. Migraine, with vomiting x1 (never had a migrane before in my life) Hot Flush x1 General aches and pains Regular periods (although differing in flow) but then two bleeds in less than a month Sudden loss of vision - now have to wear reading glasses Pressure Pain under breastbone right under xiphoid process, really uncomfortable and leads to shortness of breath. Dyspepsia/Indigestion? Occasional bloating. So basically I am here to ask are these all normal symptoms of peri/menopause? Is it normal that these things come and go then return? Is there anything on this list I should be worried about? Many thanks and can I add how glad I am that there are forums like this avaliable, its so nice to be able to go through this journey with others that are also going through it and are willing to talk and support each other through it.

I have a testosterone test from Superdrug at the end of November and the result came back as 0.3. I was prescribed 0.35ml of testogel per day. I had a retest and it came back with a testosterone level of 52!! I have immediately stopped applying the testogel but have also noticed I have gained weight for no reason. My diet hasn't changed and as a long distance runner I train 6-7 days a week and cover 50-70 miles. My diet is healthy but i have still put on 5lbs since the new year (so in 4 weeks). Could the testogel be the cause? And will my weight return to normal now I have stopped taking it? Any info about similar experiences would be appreciated!

tracy76922,2024-01-15T10:11+00:00,Perimenopausal - Anxiety,"Hello everyone Brief history - ive just turned 40, last July I weaned off citalopram after being on them for nearly 10 years, i felt fine! Then my mum got diagnosed with bowel cancer, and I was also due on my period - this all happened just before we went on a family holiday to cyprus. In cyprus I spiralled down to a very very dark place, wanted to end my life, questioning my marriage. I rang the drs while out there and asked to be put back on citalopram. Since I have have the most horrendous time of my life, debilitating anxiety constantly, scared of absolutely everything, intrusive thoughts about my marriage, thinking im never going to get better, it will be better to just end my life then live like this. Dont see my friends anymore, I still do what I have too, ie walking the dog (so do get out in nature), food shop, work from home etc, but my joy for life and zest has gone. I have been with my husband for 25 years, and he is the most supportive, loving, patient man I know and is definitely the best thing that has happened to me - so why am I getting these thoughts. We have spoke about it all for hours and hours, its killing me inside im going through this and so is he, as well as our 13 year old daughter. Rang the doctors a week ago and again explained everything and how nothing is helping, she agreed to a trial of a low dose of HRT , evorel patches 25mg and utrogestan 200mg day 15-26. To note I am also having night sweats, brittle nails, periods slightly changing, thinning hair, sleep problems and going to the loo more frequently. I have also suffered really badly with pms all my life but more so in the past couple of years, very low libido too! So im a week in and already feel a slight improvement, like the dark cloud has parted. I am just so so scared that this is just my head thinking its working, a placebo and I will crash back down - has anyone had a similar story or had massive improvement on their anxiety after starting hrt? Does it sound like it will work for me? Im so desperate for this to work. I would take any other symptom but this anxiety has ruined the past 7 months of my life - I have never ever experienced anything like it. Thank you everyone xx"
jed15436,2024-01-14T13:11+00:00,Menopausal partner,"hi everyone. really in desperate need of advice. something clicked in my partner just over 3 years ago that seemed to turn her into a completely different person. the worst part is she still seems to be getting progressively worse.the episodes are getting longer and closer together. when it happens,she is unrecognisable,saying the most hateful things about me and even my family. i should say at this point,work wise she is a bit of a high flier.she operates in a corporate world which i accept can be stressful. what tends to pour petrol on the situation is that she invariably reaches for a bottle of wine to ""dampen the emotions"". this just magnifies what is happening inside and its usually 3 to 4 days before she can function as a person again. also,she is reluctant to admit any kind of problem,either hormonally or with alcohol like a stigma exists,which again i totally get,many do not enjoy laying their soul bare. ive lived it for 3 and a half years trying to help her.the last year has made it even more difficult as ive lost both parents. these things have combined to take a toll on my own health. things came to a head recently when there was an incident where the police were involved,without wanting to go into too much detail,which has the scope to significantly change her life for the worse. the worry over that is now adding fuel to whats happening with her. im at a loss.myself along with all her family,have tried our best to support her and encourage her to get help. she wont even take the first step though,and stop reaching for the bottle. is this really something i have to put in the lap of the nhs and hope for the best.or is there somewhere i can have her admitted if i can convince her,where she will get the help she needs to get better? she has spoken of the worst case scenario when having a particularly bad episode. we all just want to help her before it gets worse for her. tia for any advice."

questionia93102,2024-01-14T15:32+00:00,Was this caused by perimenopausal hormones?,"Hi all, I could really use some help from someone with gynocological knowledge or personal experience. This regards a very unsettling situation involving my cousin, who is a long-time sufferer of an eating disorder and has had hyperthalamic amenorrhea for many years. Well, last week, out of the blue, she got a period. It was only a light one that lasted three days and didn't even drip out (hardly more than spotting). All the same, she is torn up by what happened. Let me explain that my cousin is NOT recovered (no where near recovered, in fact). Since she has severe body dysmorphia, her missing period was the only thing that assured her she was underweight. She has neither gained weight nor reduced exercise/or done anything else these ""recovery from eating disorders"" websites claim to be the silver bullet reasons for why menses would resume. In fact, the fact that these websites keep brow-beating the idea of weight gain as being the ONLY viable reason for a period to resume is very damaging to my already vulnerable cousin. If anything her BMI is even less than it was when she first lost her period! She is so upset and wants to know if there is another reason for this sudden erratic bleed NOT related to weight gain or less exercise. Note, she is almost 39, and in our family menopause typically begins early (40ish). So this begs the question on whether an estrogen surge or other hormonal imbalance related to possibly being in perimenopause could be the reason. I am working with her on going to the doctor to get tested for answers, but she is too upset right now trying to come to terms with all this. Can someone weigh in (no pun intended) and possibly confirm whether my cousin's sudden period reemergence can be related to perimenopausal hormone wackiness? If so, that would probably reassure her somewhat that she did NOT gain weight at least."

mckul6,2018-11-03T00:37+00:00,Weird head feelings and perimenopause,"Hi, I'm a 40 y/o who has actually been in perimenopause for over a year now. It started at 39 when I missed a period one month, then had a very heavy period the following month and from then on the irregular periods and symptoms all began. I get the hot flushes often where my face only becomes very hot and my cheeks bright red. These can last for hours when they happen. But most recently I've been having these weird head sensations, it's very hard to describe. I feel off balance, but not dizzy per se. The back of my head feels tight and sometimes like pins and needles. No headaches or pain at all. Just an off balance pressure like feeling. Almost like my head isn't sending the signals to my body fast enough kind of off balance. Hope that makes sense. Anyone else experience this? And I can have this feeling last all day long without subsiding at all. Also, I've noticed I can actually feel my heart beating when I lay down. It beats very hard, not fast. Is this normal? I have been to Dr who finds no other causes but says perimenopause symptoms can very and come and go as our hormones fluctuate all the time. Can't help but be scared when I feel like I'm going to fall over or my heart is going to explode. Any help out they?"

I don't mean just a stretch of time when you feel a little normal just to have symptoms return. I too have experienced these little stretches where I think I have gotten through only to be sidelined again with all of the crazy symptoms of menopause. I am 60 and have been post 11 years and the last year has been my worst yet. I was always lead to believe once your periods stop and you enter post menopause things settled down, not so for me. I am beginning to fear that this is how life is going to be here on, so scary to think this. I know acceptance is a very big part of all of this as well as ageing and I am trying my hardest to accept. Some days it is just hard not to lose hope. Just wondering if any ladies on here have truly reached the other side and stayed there. Please share your experience if there are any. Thanks ladies:)"
MoonLeaf,2016-10-20T23:27+00:00,Ear issues and Perimenopause,"In relation to Perimenopause, has anyone experienced any strange issues with their ears? Sometimes, out of nowhere, I'll hear this tonal change, like a radio tuning in or something. I know this sounds strange. I don't know quite how else to describe it. Also, I'm in the throes of PMS right now (I typically experience PMSDD which is PMS on another level), and my left ear feels as if there's air in it, or as if I need to plug my nose and gently blow in order to equalize it. I noticed something similar the other day, like a fluttering in my left ear, and I just wondered if anyone has experienced anything like this? Possibly even those of you who have said they experience dizziness, which I actually haven't experienced myself, no dizziness, just this weird ear thing. It's not an earache, it doesn't ache. It's just as if it's lightly plugged or something, or needs to be equalized. That's the best I can do to describe.  Hope this doesn't sound too ""out there!"" Lol.  Thanks for any help.

(headaches have subsided, health anxiety has subsided, digestive issues have subsided, skin issues are mostly cleared up. So physically, I am in a better place than I have been in a while). My main mental/emotional symptom is avoiding social situations, and it's really killing me! I used to love meeting up with friends to chat, even if it was just to ride along running errands or helping clean house or something. I feel like a horrible friend these days, yet the thought of connecting fills me with dread too. Can anyone relate?"
katie88102,2023-11-11T09:41+00:00,Peri and health anxiety,"well this group has helped me more in the last 3 hours than anything in the last 5 years i was diagnosed as peri 5 years ago, and only started hrt last year. The last 8 weeks however have been awful. It started with a clumsy moment that led to me burning my wrist with a pan of boiling water...that was my first trip to A&E. 2 days later i broke a tooth. Went to my dentist to get treatment. That filling broke a week later, so back to the dentist for a new filling. Anxiety started ramping up. Coupled with a very late period, usual PMS symptoms, extreme nausea and hot flashes, i went to my local pharmacy to see if there was anything i could buy to help. Pharmacist tells me she thinks i may have sepsis from the tooth! As you can guess, anxiety went mental. Went straight to A&E. Was checked over by 3 different doctors - all confused why i was there! Blood pressure was through the roof (thanks anxiety), but everything else was normal. No sepsis! Saw my GP who put me on prozac, and gave me anti sickness pills. Again, gave me a good once over and told me everything was fine. Prozac did not agree with me at all...in fact it made me feel worse, so stopped taking that and changed to amitriptyline. Anxiety was still through the roof. I convinced myself something was still wring with my broken tooth, so went back to the dentist for a third visit. they told me i now needed a root canal! To cut a long story, i ended up having the tooth pulled out...now thinking i may have over-reacted! Good job anxiety Anyway...I am coming to terms with the fact that health anxiety is a thing and am taking steps to manage this, however i wanted to thank all of you for sharing your experiences as it has helped me massively get out of my own head. I've started a multi-vitamin regime and am looking at further self-care steps i can take. And I repeat my daily mantra of ""its just anxiety""!"

cat38281,2020-11-02T08:20+00:00,Thoughts on what we're going through and how we can try to avoid exacerbating them,"Hi everyone! This is rather a long read, but I just really felt strongly in my spirit to share it in the hopes that maybe at least some of you might find it useful, especially if you're dealing with ear or headache issues. Like lots of you I first came here because I’m going through the wonders of perimenopause – some weeks ago in fact I posted about feeling almost suicidal because of all the symptoms, which include tinnitus, ear pressure, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, achiness, depression, anxiety...and weird new symptoms, like ""head pressure"" and ""face/head heat"" (""flushing"" doesn't quite seem to describe it). I’ve been dealing with all of it since about March and over the months I’ve had lots of time to whine and be miserable, but also to analyse what I’m going through and rethink it all. I thought I’d share some of my thoughts with you, both on the physical and philosophical/spiritual levels, so that perhaps, hopefully, it may be of help to at least a few of you. So firstly, the physical stuff – I think we all pretty much agree that this peri season does exacerbate a lot of things we’d already had to deal with before, like headaches etc. But in my case I’ve realised that there were also a fair bit of misdiagnoses on the parts of the specialists I saw, namely the ENT ones. I saw them because I’d been experiencing ear pain and pressure, as well as tinnitus. But my experience does show that often these guys don't really know it at all (despite their hefty fees!), and often they're stuck in their little, narrow boxes. I’d actually woken up one day 4 some years earlier with this sudden pain and crackling in my one ear; my natural reaction was to go see an ENT. Well he prescribed antivirals and basically just said deal with it. The ache and crackling went away within a couple of days, but a cricket-like tinnitus remained and over the course of those initial months, I became habituated to it. It would come and go – some days would go by completely quiet – but what I noticed was that how I slept seemed to dictate whether I’d have to deal with the crickets the next day. Despite my asking several ENTs about this, none addressed it. Fast forward to Feb/March this year and the start of the world learning about and dealing with Covid. In those early months I must admit to feeling really very stressed about it, especially where my kids were concerned (they’re all school-going age). I started feeling ear pain and pressure, like the fullness you might feel on a plane’s descent. So it was back to the ENT, and they diagnosed Eustachian tube dysfunction, for which there isn’t really a “cure”, but decongestants and nasal sprays are supposed to help. I say “they”, because I went to see not one, but several ENTs, all specialists – they all said the same thing. At the same time I noticed that the tinnitus seemed more pronounced as well, but still apparently influenced by how I slept. Of course though, none of the ENTs had any answer for this, and in fact ignored me whenever I brought it up. In the meantime, I started noticing other fun stuff, like migraines, fatigue, the weird head pressure and achiness. Somewhere along the way I finally saw my gynae, who did some bloodwork and confirmed that I was indeed perimenopausal. The ear pressure was still there – the nasal sprays did nothing – and then I started noticing an odd nudging against the inside of my ear whenever I chewed. Now the jaw joint is right next to your ear’s Eustachian tube, so you might start to see where this is going… I mentioned this “nudging” to the ENT but was predictably ignored. So I started researching on my own – sometimes we just have to do that right! And lo and behold – I came upon – temporomandibular joint disorder or TMD. This is apparently much more common than one might have guessed and is especially likely if you grind or clench your teeth a lot (either consciously or in your sleep). Look it up and you’ll find yourself opening a whole can of worms – TMD symptoms include tinnitus, headaches, facial pain, ear pain and pressure, the list goes on. Well, when I mentioned that to the ENT, he said, oh, for that I’d refer you to so and so – basically, an oral maxillofacial surgeon. So I went, they did xrays and guess what – it was indeed TMD, of the jaw joint on the side of that same ear 4 years ago. Yup. The xrays actually show the physical wear and tear of the joint. I was sent home with anti-inflammatories and muscle relaxants – it hurt, but I was glad to finally address the pressure and pain. Knowing this was not only strangely relieving, but it also highlighted to me the need to seriously learn to de-stress. This was when I started properly learning to meditate, and I highly recommend it! Even doing a few minutes of it will be helpful, because it’s forcing you to consciously slow down and be mindful. So if you think you might be a clencher or a grinder – and chances are if you are an anxious type at all, you probably are – then seriously consider getting your jaw joints checked. Or at least consciously start practising relaxation techniques and jaw-healthy habits like avoiding hard foods, and keeping your teeth apart when at rest (did you know your teeth should NEVER touch except when you bite to eat? Check the position of your teeth right now! Yup). Next – achiness and ""migraines"" and “pressure head”. These had become more pronounced too, or at least I became aware of them much more, I think because my usual anxiety levels had gone up (hence the importance of meditation!). I started to notice the achiness and tinnitus would not only coincide with how I slept (which, by the way, is pretty crap since it’s usually interrupted and I seem to somehow unfailingly jolt awake after 6 hours), but also with what activities I was doing during the day, particularly those that involved me hunching down or generally having bad posture or weird positions for a prolonged period (I’m a photographer). On closer analysis, I realised the headaches were radiating from the base of my head, where it meets my neck, although I would seem to feel them in the head. And there would also be a muscular achiness down the neck, along its sides, across my shoulders and even down the upper back (those areas which generally feel so good when someone squeezes them or affectionately gives you a back rub). In mentioning this during an unrelated visit with my Dad to his orthopedic surgeon, I learned of cervical neck pain and cervical headaches. They’re related to neck strain or injuries, which tied in with the nature of my work (sleeping badly also doesn't help I'm sure), and there can also be age-related wear and tear of the spinal disks in your neck, which, the surgeon said, is common and not unexpected in our age group. Knowing this was also strangely relieving. It not only accounted for most of what I was experiencing (yes, it is even related to TMD and tinnitus) but also compelled me to learn more healthful habits, like better posture and taking more breaks. I don’t want this to become an extended essay (I know it already is kind of!) so I’ll leave you to look these things up if you think they sound like they might apply to you at all. I just wanted to share these “discoveries” of mine because you might be going through the same thing. Could you, for example, be grinding your teeth more now, thereby causing your ear fullness and pain? Could you be hunching over your phone or craning your neck at your computer all day because you're stuck at home? Peri exacerbates all these things, and coupled with mood swings and anxiety, they can sometimes feel unbearable! But which does lead me to the other thing I wanted to quickly mention – how to live with it all. One big thing I’ve found to be crucial is acceptance. For so long as we rail against and resist what we are experiencing, the harder it wlll all be to bear. Buddhists call it the “second arrow” – in this case, peri is the first arrow; the second arrow is what we do to ourselves, in response – the railing, the resistance – as they say, ""In life, we can’t always control the first arrow. However, the second arrow is our reaction to the first. This second arrow is optional."" I had in my previous post mentioned a book that I found to be of great help; I’d share it here but it would probably get deleted, so feel free to message me if you like. One big thing I took away from it and frequently do when I begin to feel overwhelmed, is ask myself, can I let this go, even just a little? Can I accept it, just a bit, and not react so to it? I've realised a significant part of my suffering is my own reacting to what I'm going through, like an angry, even judgmental, resistance. Part of easing one's suffering is letting go of that, and trying to be more accepting. Of course it's definitely not easy when one is in the midst of it all -- especially if one already was dealing with things like anxiety and depression -- but it helps to get one through, even if it's just for the day, or even the next hour or few minutes. Meditation and practicing mindfulness are of great value to me as well; it helps one to stay in the present moment and not spiral into negativity and worries and what ifs. And then practicing gratitude – there are even apps you can download to consciously practice gratitude every day by actively looking for the good in your life 😃 Anyway, I hope whatever I’ve written has been helpful, even a little, whether in a practical or spiritual way – do feel free to message me any time; we could all use a shoulder or listening ear, especially during this season! Perhaps as a final note I will add what I always tell my kids when they’re stressed or going through a challenging time – remember you are not alone, and you are loved 💛"

I am visiting this site after a year of being infrequent visitor (because I was well). This forum saved my life during 6 years of suffering with various peri symptoms - the only place where I could find a peace if mind visiting it almost every day, just reading all posts and realising I was not alone .... Thank you ALL for that! Now I am here to tell you that I am 'old' me again. In short, 6 years of suffering ( all possible symptoms- dyspepsia, nausea, IBS, anxiety, back pain, abdominal pain, migraine, brain fogs, etc.) started improving when my period completely stopped ( I have realised that only now -after 1 year). What helped me: be positive -accept that such numerous symptoms changing daily are due to hormon fluctuations; do not focus on your symptom when it comes, find another topic/ target of thinking and you will see it will be gone even without noticing; I changed my eating habits --nothing special, just reducing sugar, eating more fruits and vegetables. What did not help me: thinking of my symptoms, visiting doctors in year 1 ( I am physician myself, nobody thought us that peri can look like this... none of my colleagues connected my symptoms with perimenopause because I was having regular periods; after such visits my symptoms only got worse because their differential diagnoses are very scary). But please visit physicians in case your symptoms get worse or if it will bring you a peace of mind ... the above is just my experience. In summary, health anxiety was my worst symptom. I wish you all a very Happy New Year! Relax, stop thinking about yourself, find another (positive) focus around you!"

Should I stick it out to see if it wears off? I can't cope with it much longer and neither can anyone around me!

staci88515,2018-11-16T14:27+00:00,I can't believe this is my life now.,"I was a normal 43 year old working woman one month ago. Suddenly, at work I had an aura w/o migraine. I had no idea what was happening to me and thought I was fainting due to a particularly heavy period. I was transported by ambulance to the hospital and released 5 hours later. It happened again two days later and then two days after that. Since then, I have had eye disturbances (blurry, flashes of light, wavy lines, visual snow, etc.). I had ever test imaginable (bloodwork, thyroid, hormones, CT scan, MRI, carotid ultrasound, etc.). I have seen my primary, a neurologist, ER twice, ophthalmologist, and the obgyn. Everyone says my tests are normal/negative and I'm okay. I'm not okay...at all. As all this testing began, I started getting waves of nausea with sweating on palms and feet. Then, came the flu-like feeling. Along the way, I started having intense anxiety. Mornings and nights brought adrenaline surges. I have so many strange sensations that there's too many to list. Least fun, are the palpitations, pressure/tension in head, internal shaking, inability to relax, and constant worry that I will have another aura. Prior to this starting, I was planning on changing jobs and pursuing a second masters degree. Now, I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown and about to lose my job. I cry everyday. I feel like my whole life is over. I am single and don't have any children. I'm scared, alone, and just wish someone would help me. I'm so confused. I thought perimenopause was just hot flashes and sweating. I work with dozens of middle aged women who are thriving. Why am I so sick and housebound?!"
miranda38397,2023-09-11T09:17+00:00,Think I might be perimenopausal,"Morning all, I'm new to this and hope you can help. I think I am possibly at some stage of perimenopause. I still have periods but they aren't as predictable as they have been. Also have had some dizziness and ringing in my ears. I've been very anxious and depressed for a while now, it's really come to a head in the last couple of months. My GP has prescribed Citalopram which I used years ago to treat depression - I've been on it a week now and it hasn't helped yet. I mentioned getting a blood test for my hormone levels but she was quite dismissive about this. Should I be asking to be prescribed HRT?"

Also a rather embarrassing question, relating to sex, does any of you lovely ladies struggle to climax even when simulating that ""sensitive"" spot down there?

If I'm gardening and leaning over its really bad then and also when I first start out walking. Doc has ordered a blood test but wants me to think about HRT. I'm really not sure about starting it at my age, I've come this far without any. Anyone else started after 60? It would be good to hear what others think, the fatigue has been a shock as I am normally one of life's busy people."
susanne30086,2015-04-01T15:15+00:00,has anybody with bad menopause symptoms also had hyperemesis (severe preg sickness?),"hi, i am just trying to see if there is a connection? i seem to be reacting strongly to changes to my hormones, as i did when pregnant (both time severe hyperemesis...) i am only 36 (i have 2 little girls 3&6 years old), recently experiencing irregular cycles with spotting, pelvic pain, back pain, anxiety, dry skin & hair, dry eyes, sleeping bad, ...all sorts of symptoms, you name it. went to various doctors, no one could find anything so far so i am assuming it's the hormones again! never had problems with pms or anything though. read a few studies on hyperemesis, it was recently found that some got better after taking progesterone. some also think it's an overactive immune system reacting to excess levels of hormones in early pregnancy, especially estrogen. it hasn't really been established what causes hyperemesis... i have quite a few allergies and there are autoimmune diseases in my family. i am just curious? ps: so happy to have found this forum!!writing from germany (so pls excuse my language), but have spent 5 years living & working in London, really missing the UK!"

Blessed_Mimi,2014-07-08T23:21+00:00,Perimenopause severe coldness?? Anyone,Hello Ladies ! I get these cold spells once a month. They are usually before my periods. My hormones are over the place right now being in perimenopause for 4 yrs now. I started to get these cold days where they was bearable in my first year. I would wake up at night and be chilled to the bone. I couldnt find anything to keep me warm. They have now turned into being so severely cold that it makes my toes sting sometimes...almost like when I was little girl playing in the snow too long. My bodie feels like I could catch the flu at any time but Im not sick with any other symtoms. My leg will go numb at times on these days.. like from the knees down to my feet. Some days I have tingling in my face around my cheeks and chin along with my hands and part of my wrist feeling tingling like it will go numb at any minute. Im not anxiuous or feeling any anxiety at these times either. I have had anxiety with my Peri but these are not the same things going on. I have seen so many doctors and no one can find anything wrong. I aslo have days during the month as if I have asthma. My chest gets so tight it hurts my jawline and my neck tightens. I have even seen an Endocrinologist an had my blood tested for any thyroid problems but they said everything looked normal. Any ladies out there with the same problems so I know its more hormones then a serious problem??? Does it ever go away after menopause?? Please let me know what youve tried that works. I CANT use HRT Ive had an ablation for Tachycardia and anything strong gives me bad heart palpitations. Maybe someone has tried a natural method that may help. Thanks Ladies !!!

lorin2362,2017-07-03T14:33+00:00,Is this Peri? I feel like im slowly dying.,"So Im turning 47 in october and for about the last two years I have been seing my doctor for increase in symptoms that dont make sence. I have had a partial historectomy but kept my overies so no periods. It started a few years ago when my hair started falling out then I developed migraines that i had never had before. The next year I had the continued hair falling out and migrains but then it was shortly followed by bouts of feeling dizzy a few days at a time. Then came the stomach problems recently. I have started having nausea and an uncomfortable dull ache in my stomach. This is accompanied by reflux and feeling like it takes all day or all night for food to digest. My doctor checked my hormones about a year ago and said they were all in normal range but I fell like I have gone very downhill since then. Along with the dizziness, migrains, nausea, and stomach discomfort i have occassional hot flashes, anxiety, depression, sleep issues, ringing in my ears sometimes, breast pain, nipple tenderness, alternating constipationand loose movements, new allergies, gallbladder symptoms even though Ive had it removed, occassional cardiac issues that dont corrispond with a cardiac problem, and chills. My newest and scarriest concern right now is the stomach problems. They started a few weeks ago now and im nausious all the time and the reflux along with feeling like food is not moving along and that gross not quite painful but very uncompfortable feeling in my stomach with burping has got me really worried. I just took a nausea pill witha few swallows of milk and I feel bloated and burping. I have had so many tests over the last few years with having my gallbladder out and I really am hoping that this sounds familiar to some of you ladies so I can relax about it a little while waiting to get in with my doctor again. (who by the way thinks im over reacting). Thank you in advance."
stella21064,2023-09-07T07:44+00:00,WHY such ANXIETY ???,"It's awful. I am about 2 & 1/2 yrs postmeno and this anxiety is just plain nuts. I actually worry when there's nothing to worry about. Or my mind always finds SOMETHING, because it has to. Otherwise I just feel anxious for no reason so my mind has to match the feeling. It's like threatening anxiety too, like with a sense of doom. And the weird adrenaline running thru me, this can't all be lack of hormones - can it? I went to just lay down on my bed after a b-day party here, I was proud of myself for sticking with it and participating the whole time. Instead of feeling relaxed, all I felt was nervous energy just pulsing through my arms and legs. I wanted to just jump out of my body and land in someone elses, someone calm. What causes this "" I can't sit still"" creepy feeling, like restless leg syndrome going thru your whole body? I'm a nervous gal, but this is a whole new level of anxiety."

In June my family got a stomach bug. Recovered in 2 days. Then the insanity followed. I was overcome with itchiness and now have hives that are inducible and just show up. I tried a low histamine diet (started losing weight too quickly and it scared me) and went on antihistamines and Quertecin. Then the twitches/spasms started and I quietly freaked out because... You know what Google tells you. I'm seeing an allergist this Thursday. I did make an appointment with a neurologist because I'm also becoming neurotic. I started taking magnesium two days ago and I think I see a slight improvement. My energy level is fine. I have no weakness, no pain. Just a rash and the twitches/spasms, which drives me nuts!

However, prior to this lovely visit, about a week prior I started feeling shortness of breath and literal pain in the middle of my chest; for sure I was having something serious with my heart. I went to the doctor and blah -blah-blah, they said I had an EKG done February of this year (for something not related - 7 months have passed, something can change in 7 months, right?). So, I left the doctors office just as I had arrived, no answers and still thinking the worst. A day passed and I get me period and -bam!-, the chest pressure/pain literally disappears! But then I get shoulder and upper arm pain and goes up my neck and I am convinced once more it is something to do with my heart. Has anyone experienced anything similar?

I have shared my menopause journey in the past and truly thought by almost age 60 and 14 years behind me I would be through this. My symptoms have never been completely gone, but over the last couple of years have been more manageable. Fast forward late last year, I just started feeling out of sorts, but pressed on and wouldn’t give in to it. February nervousness and panic attacks started. By March I was a basket case, every symptom I ever had was back on steroids. I initially thought I was just totally exhausted and fatigued from caring for my husband after his knee surgery but I have not bounced back. My labs all come back normal and I have been told by my female doctor I am too old for menopause symptoms but yet she finds nothing wrong with me. Anxiety has been thrown out as a diagnosis. I finally gave in a tried Sertraline antidepressant, made things worse so I stopped after 6 weeks. I have taken Alprazolam as needed in the past for social anxiety, but like flipping a switch, this past spring it no longer helps. I am honestly at my wits end. I don’t know if it’s the return of menopause symptoms, even though I am post 11 years, if that’s even possible or if something is really wrong with me. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

I know I wouldn’t manage this without going into panic mode.  It’s just the way I am, can’t help it. I don’t understand why I’m not having an ultrasound.  My GP said it won’t be detailed enough.

Within the past year I have had some changes in my menstrual cycle and problems sleeping. My period still comes on time, but I have had large clots for periods, other times I am quite light, there's times when I have spotting in between periods, and then there is times when all seems normal. I also have some hair thinning. My hormones were recently tested and came back with very low estrogen and very low progesterone (menopause levels). Every other hormone came back normal. My ultrasound results came back with ""17mm endometrial stripe thickness"" and ""no endometrial abnormalities identified"" and says ""endometrium is at the upper limit of normal for secretory phase, minimal pelvic free fluid, likely physiologic."" I now have to have an endometrial biopsy. What's going on?....From what I have gathered from information on the web, it says endometrial thickening is caused by too much estrogen and not enough progesterone. This isn't making sense to me.

Had a two hour appointment and was asked lots of questions to help build a picture of the help I needed. My main peri symptoms are health anxiety, digestive problems, piles,sinuses.  I am at present using a very low dosage of Oestrogel and Utrogestan and even though still early days I would much prefer the more natural route but sometimes when our symptoms get so unbearable we reach out for things just to give us a better quality of life, rightly or wrongly. I was given a remedy for my anxiety to take as and when needed and I was so amazed in how calming it was. I am now about to use Ignatia which covers a multitude of things.  I will keep you updated on how I feel after taking them. The reviews I have read have nothing but good things to say! Joy x As one of homeopathy’s polychrest remedies, Ignatia can be used to treat a wide variety of complaints. Therapeutically, it can be used for headaches, sore throat, nervousness, insomnia, heart palpitations, gas, indigestion, mood swings, menstrual irregularities, irritable bowel syndrome, painful hemorrhoids, or a dry, tickling cough, to name a few. Below are some further details on the more commonly seen Ignatia symptoms."

In May, I had my first period that spotted and last only one day. My headache was also the worst one ever - in fact, I had my first migraine with dizziness. The dizziness hasn't really gone away. It isn't horrible - there is just a constant swaying/off-balance feeling. I had my ears cleaned out -so its is not wax. The ENT just chalked it up to the migraine and said it will go away eventually. Three weeks past and PMS started along with another big headache. Dizziness was back stronger again. I have done Epley Manuevers. I am taking motion sickness meds (tried bonine, dramamine and now homeopathic). I also started Butterbur to stave off the hormonal headaches which seem to be almost constant due to shortened periods, close together, ovulation etc. One dose of Butterbur did seem to knock it down. I will see how it does long term since I just started it. Has anyone had this situation? Any other advice? I guess I really want to know will this pass once I make it to the other side - menopause. Is this just my body trying to handle the dips of hormones? I suffer from IBS, IC, heart palpitations, etc so I am used to symptoms of peri. The dizziness feeling/off-balance is really making me crazy. Thank you. Jen"
tebrown96,2020-10-26T13:17+00:00,Just need to vent - symptoms and health anxiety,"Hi all, been a while since I've posted. I've been on this whirlwind perimenopause journey for 4 years now and I have experienced an insane variety of symptoms. I should be used to them by now, but I am not. I am 46 years old and still get a (mostly) regular period, although my cycle is much shorter than it ever was before (often <21 days) and I've skipped 2 periods. The thing I have the most trouble with is the health anxiety that comes along with every new pang, twitch, pain, sensation. For the most part, I can tell myself that I do not have insert deadly disease here but there are times that my mind takes me off the deep end. It's run the gamut from ""I must have MS"" to, more recently when I had a mole removed that my doctor told me was nothing to worry about - until I got the pathology report back, I had convinced myself I had melanoma. Now, I am having a lot of muscle/tendon/bone/joint pain in random places (left ribs, sort of under the armpit; right hip; right arm, shoulder to fingers). This has now lodged in my brain as bone cancer, which I know is a completely irrational fear. I tell myself to stay away from Dr. Google, but am no good at doing so. I am hesitant to see my PCP, although I've been seeing her since I was 18 and she knows about my health anxiety. I am on a very low dose of Lexapro and am considering going to see her solely to increase that in hopes that it will help calm these thoughts. Anyway, I'm not sure what I'm looking for here other than to vent (my husband is a wonderful and supportive listener, but I know I drive him crazy with my drastic jump to dire speculation). Thanks for the ear!"

Does anyone else struggle to accept that all of these symptoms are caused by menopause? The last 3 months have been the worst of my life. Up until the end of September I was running everyday and had energy and felt good. Almost overnight I woke up with feelings of intense anxiety and constant high heart rate and palpitations. I've been to the drs so many times and had so many tests done and nothing has been found. I ended up in hospital at the end of november with an SVT, my heart rate went to 210BPM for an hour. Was so scary. No damage to the heart thankfully. I have also recently had covid and everything seems to be 100 time worse now. I keep getting stabbing pains in my stomach/abdomen (had an ultrasound and MRI and all normal), weird head pressure which goes into my ear, jaw and neck. One eye keeps going blurry. Hip and back ache. Reflux. I feel 100 years old and am struggling to walk up the stairs. I look in the mirror and feel like I look haggered. I'm on Beta Blockers at the moment for the high heart rate and this has helped slightly with the anxiety but I still feel so down and have no enthusiasm for anything. The future seems bleak if this is what I'm going to feel like. I've tried body identical HRT (estrogel) but this was at the height of my anxiety and I feel like it made it worse so stopped. Sorry for the long post. Does anyone have any advice or feel the same? I have to keep reminding myself that if there was anything seriously wrong with me they would've found it by now with the numerous tests and scans I've had. I'm 46. Thank you x"

Per a few of my previous posts, I am doing countless STELLAR things to be well, (including PRAYING) yet this RELENTLESS FORCE of: nervousness, anxiety, aches and pains, racing thoughts, negative thoughts, chest pains, rib cage pains, rage, allergies, hormonal-imbalance, flatulence, bruised legs, dry eyes, stiff fingers, shifting teeth, abdominal pains, sore throat, headaches, heart palpitations, anger, teeth grinding, isolation, fear, health anxiety, fear of the unknown, impending doom and gloom, fatigue, bouts of crying, loss of appetite, eating everything in sight, facial pains, ear aches, isolation, hair loss, thinning hair, back aches, creaking knees, shortness of breath, hives, itching, adult acne, insomnia, cravings for snacks, cravings for White Castle burgers, cravings for Oberweis ice cream, moodiness, numbness, can't seem to laugh anymore, depression, etc.. are the MAIN reasons I don't fell well, often! It's TOO much! I am in the full blown POST-Menopausal stage, and my symptoms have NOT subsided or gotten better, they got WORSE!! How I wish these symptoms were a bus, simply because I would get off at the next stop! Having said that ladies, how do you all cope, with this relentless HELL on Earth?"

sharcerv52408,2023-06-24T20:51+00:00,Is it just me?,Hello Ladies! I am eight months post menopause and I have noticed that all of my peri menopause symptoms have reached an all time high since I no longer get periods. Also do any of you seem to have an intolerance to heat? I mean I know we get heat flashes and those are always the worst but I mean like an aversion to any heat. If it's above a certain temperature outside I feel overly hot and start to feel panicky and anxious. I can't even tolerate hot showers any more. I was baking desserts in my kitchen for a church function and I had to leave the kitchen and sit in an air conditioned room in my house to settle myself. I never used to have this before menopause. Anyone else get this?

Do any of you LOVELY ladies experience anxiety, nervousness, racing and negative thoughts... when you all wake up?

I often wonder, will I ever FULLY recover from this tsunami? Intrusive thoughts, ruminating thoughts, aches & pains, numbness of my face, stiff hands, cold feet, the tv watches me, cray-cray thoughts, heart palpatations, nervousness, anxiety-overload, can't focus/concentrate, frequent urination, constipation, adult acne, fear of the unknown, health anxiety, chest pains, rib cage pains, creaking knees, itching, brittle nails, shortness of breath, depression, teeth pain, headaches, dry eyes, etc... Those are SOME of the COUNTLESS symptoms, I have experienced during this rollercoaster ride of my post-menopausal life! My symptoms have gotten WORSE during this LAST stage of menopausal journey!! Suffice it to say, the meno trios are absolutely exhausting and horrific! I eat right, I am pretty active, I take high-end vitamins, journal, etc.. yet I KNOW for a fact that menopause pushes its way through everything good, and finds it way to WREAK havoc on us womenfolk! Hence the theme from Shaft revised: You see that cat Hormonal Imbalance is a BADD MUTHA, SHUT YOUR MOUTH!! That being said, are any of you tired of this sugar, honey, ice tea? RANT on my sistahs!"

Headaches and throat pain and severe digestive issues and spine/back pain and sore ribs and bones and bad gas and bloating and needing to burp but cant seem to get it out 😭 and probably a bunch of other weird symptoms ive forgotten about. please tell me im not alone and NOT dying. im tired of running to the dr only to be told everything and every test looks fine. im positive its perimenopause but some says the anxiety makes it hard to be rational

Since 1 month, I have a drowsiness/dizziness in my head. I feel off balance but actually not losing my balance in real, it is just a feeling. Very weird feelings and hard to explain. Some days while I'm sleeping at nights, I woke up with head tightness/pressure like there is a headband around my head..no blood pressure. I had my blood test done recently and some low levels with Iron,B12, D vit and Biotin. I have started to take supplements . My doctor also advised me to take antidepressants but I haven't started and not sure if I should take or not. I went to another doctor to check if there is any problem with my ears but he didn't see any abnormal and asked me to have further tests like balance and hearing tests. I tried to explain him about my peri-menopause but he didn't understand :- I would be very pleased if anyone shares her experiences having similar problems like mine. Thanks a lot!"
brad63190,2023-07-01T23:38+00:00,Wife may be in menopause and I'm here new worst enemy now,"I never thought i would be submitting on a forum but im looking for advice and confirmation. We have been married for 30 plus years and now in our early 50's. We never had the picture perfect marriage, but it was pretty darn good for 25 years. We only had each other and were each others strongest supporters. we raised two amazing kids. My wife always adored me for who i am. About 5 years ago, my wife blind sided me with a 2 hour long rant about how she was never happy with me and much more. After many requests for us to seek counseling, she finally agreed. our counselor at one point told me that my wife was most likely dealing with a mid life crises, childhood trauma to which i was now the target of all her trauma do to her mom while growing up, and pre- menopause. Again, im not perfect, and im sure im tough tough to live with at times but i feel like something glitched in her where i became the reason for any and all her own unhappiness. when this all started, our oldest child had left for college- which i think had a part to play in it. over the next several years she turned into a different person. She got pretty deep into conspiracy theories, she seemed to become very equipped at having a road block for any and all efforts i made to communicate and reason with her. she went from a sweet, giving woman that was a believer in me and our partnership to a person who was now smarter than most. She refuses to allow me to express my feelings about whats going on, and is completely brutal with her words when describing me and my actions. she brings up fights from 25 years ago and makes up new ones to explain how bad i was and am. After these fights and with no communication about them, she will act like nothing ever happened and appear to love me. im dying to be able to explain to her what i see and think is going on. She has all the other symptoms of menopause as well. However, she no longer believes in modern medicine, so she wont seek help or even consider a doctor. When i have mentioned (at the very most perfect times) maybe she could be going through menopause, she flys off the handle accusing me of calling her crazy. i am going crazy not being able to express any of my feelings. Every incident results in her taking the most extreme victim role and then accusing me of being the worst man on the planet, while she proceeds to call me vulgar names and smear my whole character. She has abruptly changed careers to where now she travels a lot, my children have expressed frustration as well. Its miserable for both of us, she is so unapproachable yet when vulnerable tells me how im not giving her what she needs- like and affection but i have such a hard time because she has made me her enemy. does this sound like menopause, how long does it typically last, when it does pass, will the real her be back, do you have advice for me? any help would be appreciated."

Also I notice it's like I'm super aware of my own body to, any sensation in my body, I'm so aware of, drives me mad, and makes me more anxious and scared.

jenni70,2019-12-08T08:52+00:00,Pulse/whooshing in head with pressure.,"I know about pulsatile tinnitus, and i do have ""regular"" tinnitus, but I'm hoping someone has had this feeling as well during the hormonal fluctuations. I'd like to believe that this sensation is another weird symptom in meno, rather than the descriptions online of what could be causing this pressure and pulse pound in my head. I seem to go through phases of it, so I'm hoping that's a good thing, but I'm in a bad spell right now and am fighting off the fear factor. The best way to describe it is to hear my pulse in my ear, usually with head pressure/head feels full of air, and sometimes a dull headache at the base/back of my head. It can sometimes pound or ""whoosh"" quote loudly, and often most noticable when lying down. Almost like hearing an ultrasound machine on the womb. I'm seeing my Dr right before the holidays, but I'd like to know if others have experienced this as well. It's definitely activating my anxiety & I try really hard to breathe through that and divert my mind when its happening."

Now it comes and goes but is a bit more extreme/noticeable. It feels like I'm swaying or rocking. I've been to so many doctors and specialists. It is not vestibular migraine, and it improves when I drive. What freaks me out the most is, I could go all day without this rocking sensation, then I take a 5 minute nap in the early evening, and it's back! Then it stays with me, and it's sometimes still there when I wake up in the a.m., sometimes it's gone again. HOW could a nap cause it to return??!! I'm 2 years post menopause. It started 1 year post. Will it ever leave me? Anyone else have this?? Thank you all!"

I heard all the horror stories about menopause and was like ""what are these people complaining about - this is a breeze"". Well, it was up until about a few months ago. Thinking back, last December (I remember this because I was hosting Xmas and thought, this ""flu"" needs to go away or I am going to puke on everyones food. It did pass (lasted for about 2 weeks)so chalked it up to the flu. Came back a few months later, then again in September (again lasted about 10 days), then again in October and it's been pretty constant ever since with a few days here and there where I feel decent. I have always had really good labs and my labs in July (4 months ago) were actually the best I have ever had. This nausea would not stop so went to the doctor and they ran a few more: FSH 108.4 LH 51.9 B12 835 Amylase 98 (they ran these because of the nausea/pancreas) Lipase 27 CA-125 was 6 Doctors said I am post menopausal and not ONE recognized nausea as a symptom. She has me convinced I am crazy or dying of cancer somewhere. I am going for an H-Pylori test tomorrow. She said it sounds like THAT could be a possibility as everything else is coming back normal. IS this normal or is it now? I am not bloated, don't get full quickly, no bleeding, not tired a lot, but the nausea, hot flashes, and feels like I have a sock at times twisted on the upper right of my stomach under my ribs and sometimes have a slight achy pain in my right shoulder blade which makes me wonder if this is gall-bladder. I don't really have abdominal pain (maybe a twinge once an awhile on the lower right that I usually disregard. I am thinking all the worst and praying this is just menopause so hoping you sweet ladies can either squash or confirm I am not going crazy and not dying of cancer or some God awful thing. I force myself to eat, have not lost any weight (surprisingly). Anybody have any thoughts!???"

Finkyb,2023-04-06T18:29+00:00,Jaw pain,"Hello ladies, Has anyone experienced jaw pain during perimenopause? My jaw on both sides is achy and feels tight. I'm not sure if the pain originates from the jaw as it doesn't hurt to open my mouth or eat/chew. Some other symptoms I have been getting are headaches and pressure in my head. It sometimes feels like it's my sinuses and my eyes can feel strained too. I also feel off balanced at times. I had balance testing done last year and all was Ok and had a head MRI which was thankfully normal. All these symptoms seem to come and go and not always at the same time. It makes my anxiety worse which I know isn't helping but would love to hear from anyone who has or is experiencing anything similar and if they found anything that helps. This on top of all my other symptoms is making life a bit miserable to be honest."

sharcerv52408,2023-04-01T16:42+00:00,This is just too much!,"Hello all! I read on this forum a while back from some of the other women that once you're in menopause that the symptoms that you've experienced during peri menopause get worse. I can now attest to this fact. I haven't had a period since December of 2021, so suffice it to say I am now in full blown menopause. All of the symptoms that I used to get during peri have all kicked it up a notch or ten notches, I should say. Recently, I have been battling with worsening anxiety which causes me to wake up feeling nervous and jittery. I have wobbly feelings in my legs. I feel a nervous feeling in my chest when I go to take a breath. I have this tight feeling under my ribs that sometimes moves to the breastbone area and then to my back which sends my anxiety through the roof. Then I have been having migraines with vertigo for the past couple of days and don't get me started on the heat flashes. I can't take it any more! I had to resign from job because I couldn't deal with these symptoms while working a full time job that was very stressful plus I am still raising two kids at home. I feel like I am losing it sometimes. They say this is supposed to last 10-15 years? This is like being sentenced to a life of misery. I miss the old me when I was happier and felt good. I feel like I'm so old. I am only 49 but I feel like I am 69. Please tell me that it gets better!"

I used to get a killer headache/migraine that would literally knock me sick, in the lead up to my period. I would also get night sweats, so bad that I'd wake up dripping wet and freezing cold. The smell was like vinegar (sorry). Both symptoms faded away and I thought no more of it. I'm still get periods but they are sometimes lighter or heavier, longer or shorter! My symptoms aren't just there in the lead up to my period starting. My symptoms are: random insomnia night sweats anxiety low mood emotional/weepy short tempered/snappy/quick to anger/irritable wanting to be alone urinating a lot getting the runs/constipation low sex drive (none existent really) itchy skin mainly on an evening breast pain/soreness/weird sensations tingly hands when in bed ringing ears hair thinning dizziness feeling like I'm losing control - this comes from nowhere and I feel like I'm going to die headaches - they have now eased lack of focus forgetting what I'm doing bleeding gums dry down there! More recent symptoms are weird lower rib pain, not really painful, more uncomfortable, also in breast bone, sharp pains in shoulder blades. This is NOT constant, comes and goes. The symptom that is worrying me the most is hard to describe but I will try my best. So I get it when I'm exerted and bending over, like when hoovering stairs or weeding etc. It's like a pressure feeling near my breast bone, it knocks me sickly. Could this be like a reflux issue do you think? I've been weeding today and I get it when leaning forward. I've also noticed I get a similar uncomfortable feeling when lying on my right side, like a feeling of something stuck. Any help would be so appreciated. This health anxiety is driving me NUTS."

I am experiencing unpleasant menopausal symptoms, which are also worsening the CFS, so I'm considering taking HRT. I am looking for a (probably private) Menopause Specialist/Consultant who specialises in endometriosis. This is important as the prescribing of HRT is different for those with endometriosis. I am also hypermobile, which can be affected by taking hormones, so would need them to have a good understanding of this too. Furthermore, I have allergies, gut issues and other complex health issues related to the severe CFS, so would need them to have a good understanding of my condition, and how it may be affected by taking HRT. It is vital I find someone who is experienced and knowledgeable about all of the above, so they can help me weigh up all these potentially conflicting needs, and find the best solutions me around taking HRT, and managing the menopause.

I think the title is less important than finding someone with the relevant experience, knowledge and expertise. I need to find the right person for my particular needs.

Periods stopped a year ago. The symptoms have only gotten worse, day by day. I've never had depression or anxiety in my life, I've always been insanely happy and full of joy and energy all the time, and suddenly I am crippled by both. I have no interest in anything anymore. I can barely function. I have no energy and no hope. All I want to do is lay down, can barely walk. The brain fog is horrible, I have no patience for anything, I cry constantly over nothing, deep and painful sobbing crying, my body doesn't function anymore (pain, aches, chest pains, internal buzzing and tremors, dizziness, ringing ears, sweating, chills, can't remember anything, phantom cramps, nausea). I want to give up because I don't have any motivation for anything. Everything, even going to the store, just feels like too much effort. I feel like I'm 85 years old, I'm only 54. I've tried everything and nothing even comes close to touching this (I have been insanely healthy about diet, exercise, organic, etc., my whole life, blah blah blah...boring and none of it helps this). This is an evil force and life wrecker. I really don't understand how something can feel so bad and there is no remedy. Apparently HRT will give you cancer, but should we just do it anyway? I'm going to end my life anyway if I don't start feeling better, so I might as well feel better for a while? I feel like I'm dying more each day and I am really trying to determine a way out of this. How the hell are 50-something celebrities who seem to be fine getting through this? How did Madonna get through this? I know these sound like inane comments, but jeezus I just can't go on another day. This seems incredibly unfair, and especially because I never even had children, never wanted to.

I'm doing everything possible to alleviate symptoms. Yoga, meditation, gentle walking, a good diet, don't smoke or drink, but I feel I have no quality of life as the chest pain and tiredness ruin it all! Otherwise, I have a wonderful life and I am so lucky, and just want to enjoy it, not be worried about dying every second of every day! Seeing GP next week about HRT. How are others doing with HRT? I know everyone is different. Thanks so much x"

I have so many of the listed symptoms, but one that baffles me is having a sharp mood swing, usually from fine to raging fury of a thousand demons, and then waking up the next morning sick to my stomach and usually with diarrhea. It's happened several times over the last year or so, the wave of rage the one day followed by the stomach troubles the next. I think it took until the third time it happened for me to realize it might be connected to a sudden hormone swing, but I wondered if anyone else had this issue? A sudden mood swing or swings accompanied by stomach/gastric troubles?"

I just want to know is this drowsiness and down in the dumps feeling a known side effect with the HRT? Also I've been feeling really sick and been getting irritable legs and knees(but I put that down to the tiredness) also A shooting pain in my ovaries. I sound like a hypochondriac but I'm really down. Don't get me wrong even though they told me I was infertile I've got 2 beautiful children and I don't like to moan but at the moment I feel I can't win I've had 4 operations to help with the endo and I've had 2,6month courses of prostap, but this is the first time I've been on tibolone. And I've never felt anything like it. But with out it I went through the menopause, and before the prostap I was in agony, I understand there are side effects with everything. But I'm wondering if anyone else has felt or feeling the same as me and if they could give me advice. I have to be careful what I can take because I am breastfeeding. Just hope someone can shed some light on the situation xxxx"

I have good days when I feel this is ""all in my head"" .. but the bad days. 😣 My goodness. I will explain the symptoms and if anyone is in early/mid post, please let me know if you can relate. Waking up in a complete panic ☀️ in the morning. Hands are shaky. Burning arms, tops of thighs. Vibrating feeling in both feet. Strange, negative thoughts. Afraid of my own medication, feeling hopeless about everything, for that day. Seeking constant reassurance that this is menopause and it will pass. Extremely tired, so try to take a nap, and then getting confused or panicky when falling asleep, body jerks, leg kicks, sometimes feels like I'm sleeping in another room, until I open my eyes. It's like meno-brain when I try to take a nap. This only happens on the bad days. Restless legs middle of night - I can handle this one. WORST SYMPTOM: This jittery, nerve-wrecking almost pain like feeling running through my arms and legs. It's like restless leg syndrome but it's like my nerve endings are being irritated - imagine like a toothache throughout the arms and legs.. and that causes me to panic. It usually comes with the sunburn feeling on upper arms, shoulders, tops of thighs On and off rocking/swaying - imbalanced.. but I've actually gotten used to this one. Seems to go away when well-rested. Can anyone relate? Sometimes by night, or even the middle of the night, things seems to settle. I always wake up between 2-5 am. Then try to get back to bed. It is not easy. Do hormones still fluctuate in post meno? Peri was a breeze compared to this. Thanks for reading.."

Katie19990,2022-10-23T21:11+00:00,"Acid Reflux, Internal Burping","Hi Ladies, I've been lurking for a while and have been reading the many threads and can relate to so many. I am going on 47 and I'm sure I've hit the perimenopause stage although my practice nurse says I can't be because I am still regular! Notwithstanding that my monthlies have gone from 34-36 days all my life to 28-29 days for the last 12 months. Anyway, I digress. For some time I have been suffering a lot from acid reflux and more of this kind of internal burping straight after I eat or drink anything. It also occurs randomly throughout the day, I wake up with it and its driving me mad. I went to see the practice nurse earlier in the year and she prescribed Omerprazole but after a couple of weeks changed me to something else in order to do a h-pylori test (which came back clean). Life kind of got in the way and I didn't go back yet I am still suffering on a daily basis. Eventually, I plucked up the courage to have a telephone appointment a couple of weeks ago and I'm back on 4 weeks of Omerprazole, if it doesn't improve then I need to go back and I'm likely to be referred for a camera down my throat. Now I have also have major health anxiety and anxiety in general so this scares me to death. I personally can't see any difference on these pills. I eat fairly clean, don't drink much and avoid most of the triggers but still suffering. I have read many times that acid reflux at this stage in life can be a result of changing hormone levels. I would love to hear from others who have similar issues, what they have been on, whether they have had any further tests and whether there are any more natural methods I can try to alleviate my symptoms? Big thanks x"

My first post focused on Anxiety and the possibility of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. It has recently been brought to my attention, there is a possibility my symptoms could be hormone related. Something I never actually considered. Brief list of symptoms... Fatigue (groggy and heavy type tiredness) Brain Fog Feeling detached and 'spaced out' Weak and Shaky Jelly Legs Weak Fingers and Toes Sensitive to light and sound Sometimes feels like I have flu or a bad virus (even though I know I don't) Light Headed Light Dizziness Easily tired out Occasional Palpitations Frequent urination (occasionally) Anxious (more so than usual) Brief History... I have had anxiety issues, on and off, for many years and also hormone induced migraines. This year the migraines are definitely worse and so too is the anxiety. I had an 8 day brutal migraine early/mid September, followed by 8 days of severe brain fog/dull fuzzy head. I haven't been the same since. I'm also wondering if my symptoms are migraine related? I've had 2 full blood tests done and 2 urine samples taken. All came back normal/clear and healthy. I've also been to see an ENT consultant who ruled out an inner ear virus. He also checked my throat and balance. I had a full eye examination last week and my eyes are in great shape. I have an MRI booked next week and also an appointment to get an ECG recorder fitted for 48 hours. My symptoms are so broad and general, it could be a number of things... I have even considered CFS. Now I'm thinking it could be hormone related? I feel more anxious not knowing what this is! Is anybody experiencing anything similar? Any replies/advice would be greatly appreciated x"

It went from normal periods to crazy long ones and very heavy flooding ones with massive clots to having missed periods every 3 or 4 months apart. I think my estrogen was sky high because I would get so much slimy egg white discharge before my periods. But now I'm spotting on and off with no period. I am NOT on any HRTs. This brown discharge is scaring me the most . Reading stuff on the internet is so confusing and terrifying . They either say you probably have Uterine, Ovarian or cervical cancer OR it says its normal So my spotting/discharge started I think about a month or 2 ago. Its everyday but very light. It goes from normal white/yellow for a few days to reddish 1 day to light brown for a few days and then the cycle starts all over again with normal discharge 😦 I was under the impression that the late part of perimenopause your discharge was suppose to have a brownish tint to it and it was a normal thing. SO I never really worried. BUT I googled (VERY BAD IDEA) and now I'm terrified. Please don't tell me I need to go check it out. I know and I will. But right now I so scared i'm crying all the time.

I have given up on ""feeling great"" and will settle. the only way i can describe the way i feel is to say that its like a poisonous gas flowing towards me - i can feel it coming, it reaches me - my eyes burn, my ears fill, my teeth start hurting, i get dizzy, anxious, depressed, and then it lets up for a few minutes. I question whether it was real, and then it starts flowing towards me again. Time and time again you cannot out run it or medicate it. you just have to let it rollover you.

sandra12561,2023-02-16T10:25+00:00,Could this be perimenopause or a hormonal issue,"It all started last March. I tested positive to hpylori, around the same time i started experiencing lightheadedness, shortness of breath, chest pains & racing pulse. I went to the ER & was cleared for any heart problems, I also have seen many different drs. After triple therapy I was back to normal for about 6 weeks then these symptoms started again. I went to the ER 3 times & each time they have cleared my heart. I then noticed a pattern, each of my hospital appointments were a month apart all mid cycle & would seem to settle when my periods started. I booked in to see a female dr to ask for a hormone test & she shrugged it off & said I was too young to worry about that. I AM 45 years old. I then booked in to see a male dr but he basically said the same thing. I begged him for one so he sent me for a FSH test which came back normal. In march last year they found i had higher blood pressure when I stood up & they found I had low vitamin D. This is all they found. The dr mentioned that it could be anxiety because the tests are all coming back clear. It is scary, I feel alone & left to fend for myself. It is affecting my life, I'm scared I will lose my job, I rarely leave the house unless someone can come with me. Has anyone ever experienced this with perimenopause or hormonal issues. I need some advice or even a better understanding of peri menopause so I can get through this. Is there a test I can ask for to see if it is perimenopause? Any help would be good."

I am DEEP in the throes of post-menopause, roughly SEVEN years, to be specific; that said, since I've been on this last hormonal-horror journey of my life, my symptoms have escalated! Now for the sake of clarity, there are GOOD days, and they come in waves, yet the BADDD ones outweigh the days when I feel like a NORMAL, functional person. Suffice it to say, I PUSH through thee relentless symptoms of anxiety, aches and pains, joint stiffness, racing/negative thoughts, irrational thoughts, swollen knees, swollen ankles, an enlarged stomach, adult acne, rage, itchy skin (internal & external), depression, lashing out at others, chills, cravings, dry eyes, feet pain, flatulence, frequent urination, insomnia, etc., to do the things I need to do in order to maintain my livelihood. I know those are a LOT of symptoms, yet I have/have had a BOUT with them all and then some. Which brings me to this: Can any of you post-menopausal ladies attest to what I am saying? Have your symptoms gotten WORSE in this last menopausal stage of your life?"
TheWildDog,2023-01-29T14:03+00:00,"Weekly episodes where I sound & look very drunk. GP suggests menopause, is it something more?","I am writing this post on behalf of my mum and it's going to be a lengthy one. She is 52, no pre-existing health conditions established, although she did have bell's palsy about 10 years ago, but her face and features returned back to her normal after several months. HbA1c was tested several months ago and was fine Electrolytes (sodium/potassium) are fine Blood pressure normal Hormone levels are normal Blood sugar before and after eating are fine ECG was fine Thyroid was fine, tested twice. She doesn't smoke or drink (but uses the nicorette inhalator). Has a very physical job, sometimes with long days. Around a 18 months ago, I noticed that her facial expressions very slightly changed, and so did her speech. This would come in small waves at a frequency of maybe once a week or every other week, in the evening. As I am very observant I seemed to be the only one that noticed it, and it wasn't noticed by my sibling. Over the next six months it got slightly more pronounced and more frequent. These were not an all day occurrences, but, would start maybe around 6pm at night until she went to sleep. Then the next day she'd wake up normal. However, 13 months ago, she started to go a little 'off' in the evening like she usually would. However, her speech became very, very slurred, her speech became a very slow, she couldn't stand up or walk properly and we had to guide her to bed as it was like she couldn't properly coordinated her limbs. She forgot to feed the cats like she normally does. Her friend came round, and her friend said if she wasn't told, she'd have thought she was very drunk. This really panicked me, because it came on over the course of 30 mins. She didn't go to A&E straight away, but I asked her to speak to her GP in the morning, they advised her to go to A&E. She was seen in A&E about 16 hours later after the event. They took a blood test and did a CT scan of her head, and they said everything came back fine. I was concerned she'd had a TIA. The only thing she had was a UTI. They sent her on her way with antibiotics and said if it happens again go to her GP. However, whilst these 'episodes' haven't been as bad as the one that made her go to A&E, they are becoming more frequent, where several times a week, she was start to slur her speech, the eyelid that had bells palsy starts to drop a little, her speech becomes a little slower/she becomes slower to respond. It's not that she slurs some words, it's that all over her words become slurred, she speaks much more slowly, and almost takes her a small while to process things. It's almost like she's tipsy several times a week, but she doesn't drink. It seems that stress/tiredness triggers these episodes, although sometimes they can almost be sporadic (to me at least). The GP said it was likely menopause or perimenopause related, but I've trawled the internet and forums to try and get an answer. I know menopause and stress can cause a whole variety of symptoms, but I haven't seen anything like my mums. She is not on HRT at the moment, as the doctor is reluctant to put her on HRT, due to familiar history of breast and ovarian cancer. He gave her 10mg of citalopram to stabilise her mood, and told her to keep taking her B-vitamins and magnesium. Due to the frequency and lack of answers, I've turned to forums to try and gain some answers. I've asked her to go and see a neurologist privately because I am quite concerned, but in the meantime, I am trying to search some answers, to see if maybe it is actually menopause related. Has anyone had anything similar?"
solaralex,2022-11-29T23:08+00:00,Incontinence and peri-menopause,"Hi everyone, I have been on the menopause journey for the last 3 years. I'm 47, and have had long breaks between periods (3 - 4 months), hot flushes intermittently, low mood, headaches. Last 3 days I noticed tiny amount of urine leaking out throughout the day. Not enough to leak through underwear but enough to notice that it's wet. It's not from sneezing, coughing or exercise and usually happens after I've been to the toilet. I also woke up this morning with damp underwear so it must have happened at night. Really freaked out, definitely the worst symptom of menopause, if that's the problem. Has anyone had that and have you been able to get to the bottom of it? Thank you!"
Guest,2017-08-25T17:11+00:00,Dry mouth and Vitamin D?,"Hello!  I haven't been here for a while, so a quick background - 46 years old, had ovary removed last year, 20+ years with Crohn's disease, peri symptoms/issues for 3 years.  I had a gyn exam in April with urinalysis (but not bloodwork) and all was normal.  In May, I had my GI/Crohn's follow-up exam; the doctor ordered bloodwork and results showed a Vitamin D deficiency.  The doctor said this happens in a lot of Crohn's patients and told me to supplement with 2,000 IU daily.  After I'd been on the supplement for a while, I felt like I had more energy overall.   Around this same time, I stopped taking dicyclomine, which my GI doctor had prescribed for intestinal spasms.  Dry mouth is listed as a side effect for dicyclomine, but I have never had that side effect in all the years I've taken it.  However, I had to start taking it again a few weeks ago when the spasms recurred.  Within a few days of starting it, I started noticing that my mouth was drier than usual - not parched, but drier.  I drink lots of water daily, so I knew something was wrong. I stopped taking the dicyclomine since I knew it could cause dry mouth.  My mouth was less dry but still drier than usual.  I became very scared that something serious could be wrong with me since dry mouth can signal serious problems.  Then, I read today that after taking Vitamin D for a while, the body can be getting more than it needs and dry mouth can be a symptom of that.  The tip of my tongue is red and slightly irritated/burning and I also saw this listed on a site about having too much Vitamin D in the body. I am scheduling an appointment to have my Vitamin D checked again.  The GI doctor did not order a follow-up visit to check it, but I am going anyway to see if this is the problem or not.  It seems odd that the dicyclomine would suddenly cause dry mouth when it has never done that before, and taking the Vitamin D is really the only major change I've made.  I read that it doesn't take a high dose to produce these side effects, that it can build up over time and start causing problems, and I do also eat enriched foods and go out for walks in the sun.  The initial burst of energy that I felt after I started on the supplement is long gone, and I'm back to being just as tired, depressed, and anxious as I was before.  I am freaking out with worry that something serious is wrong - AGAIN - as it seems that's all I do since starting peri.  Please help."

Amongst all the horrible symptoms, the worst thing is the crippling anxiety and panic. It doesn't seem to matter what I do - I've had so much counselling, there's just nothing left to say. I journal every day, I meditate twice a day, I do breathing exercises three times a day, progressive muscle relaxation twice a day, and not to mention the endless self-help courses and books I've worked through, but it just continues to keep coming back and getting worse and worse and worse. The last seven years have just gone by in a blur of severe depression, extreme anxiety, panic attacks, health anxiety, OCD and rage. At this point I'm just crossing my fingers and hoping for menopause. But then I read other people say these symptoms continue after menopause, and that just leaves me feeling hopeless. Is there really no end to this, even after the menopause is over?"

I have been pretty anxious for some time now due to ongoing shooting pains in my breasts- definitely has to be non cyclical, because it is there most days, although isnt always as bad as other times, but i have had several checks now at a breast clinic plus an ultrasound on the breasts and underarms and showed all is well. so that's great. and i also recently had a comprehensive list of bloods taken and again all is good. more recently i have now got some armpit discomfort, mostly in the right armpit. there are no rashes, swellings or lumps (which is great) and the doctor is not concerned. but it does ache and is sometimes sore, and also the arm and shoulder aches! i have had random joint and wrist aches for a while that are on and off. i am just wondering if this can be any thing to do with the start of Perimenopause? i ask because the doctor said there is a chance this is the case but i just wondered if anyone else here has had similar symptoms or knows anyone who has? thanks in advance (and apologies for lack of capital letters- my phone won't automatically put them in!)"

A little about my menopause journey.. I am 63 years young. i wished my mom (may she RIP) would have given me heads up on what my body would go through as I age. I heard about menopause when I was younger..I thought hot flashes, night sweats, dry vagina...Oh noooo, it's much more. Nobody, not even a physician educated me..but I found out..I'm living it. I feel as if someone stole my body and holding it for ransom..lol..gotta laugh to keep from crying. Things started shifting a bit for me at age 47. I went through a period of high anxiety. I felt like all food was bad for me..I lost a lot of weight. I would have panic attacks while driving..horrible. I went to the ER about 2x a month for several months. However, I can't blame it all on menopause..I was stressed as well due to marital issues. Fast forward. Anxiety is much better but it's still hanging around. my biggest issue is muscle tension and tightness. My jaw, scalp, neck,shoulders, abdomen..all tight. I also have sciatica and maybe arthritis. Muscle knots here, there everywhere. I visited so many Dr's in the beginning of all this..they had no answers. A few ask me if I was seeing a therapist..which I was. I think that helped with the Anxiety. i eat healthy for the most part. Not on meds except a 2.5mg valium as needed. I have a glass of red wine or two..which helps with the tension/stiffness. Was told I had an autoimmune disease about 10 years ago but several other Dr's told me I dont...which I feel I don't. I meditate every morning which I enjoy. i want my body back when i was more relaxed and not all stiff and tensed up. i will pay the ransom..lol. I try to stretch but i think i stretched a bit too much one morning which really irritated my sciatica. I'm taking it easy now days. This can really get you down if you allow it to..i refuse to allow it to run my life and hold me hostage. I am a firm believer, this too shall pass. I know I will begin to release this built up tension. Praying that we all get through this and have many pleasant years. Thanks to all that took the time to read my post. Hope their are others that can relate and hope my post help someone know you are not along. Sending Much love to all 💕"

My symptoms range from, aching joints, very very dry skin ( itching like theres no tomorrow ), insomnia, fatigue, crazy mood swings, i went to the seaside last year with my family where i found a little boy who was lost, when his father was finally located & reunited with his son i cried like a baby in front of a very packed beach (i wanted the ground to swallow me up). I don't think i've ever felt so tired in my entire life, theres days where i have to crawl back into bed. I have also lost all my friends as I didn't realise at the time that the way i felt was down to perimenopause & i managed to alienate all of them till they eventually fell out with me, I just wanted to be alone all the time & making conversation & doing anything was just too much trouble. I am very angry a lot of the time & my poor husband gets the brunt of it. Brain fog & forgetfulness is ridiculous (i'd forget my head if it wasn't screwed on) I have to set alarms for everything from appointments to taking medication & everything else in between. My periods went from being regular as clockwork to every 3 & a half weeks apart to now just spotting occasionally. I really don't want to take HRT as i've never been a fan of medication, i prefer to try & ride it out but i'm at my wits end so if anyone has any natural remedies i could try i'd be grateful for all suggestions."

brandon,2019-08-14T11:52+00:00,Patience is reaching Breaking Point,"Hello, I am after some candid advice. Please be honest and brutal. Trust me; I can take it. There is one thing about being married, and totally in love with menopausal women, you learn to develop a “thick skin” and tolerance. However, I feel my patience is running out. A bit of background about me and my situation: my wife entered the surgical menopause seven years ago. After numerous medical appointments, we eventually found a specialist menopause nurse who prescribed the correct HRT. My wife and I are in our early fifties, both of us are in full-time employment, and we are “comfortable”. Neither of us has any medical conditions. We are very sporty and have great families and friends. We have a great social life and go out as a couple or with our friends. I am really in love with my wife. She is my soul mate, best friend, and I fancy her like crazy. Watching her go through the menopause is terrible, and I have done my best to support her. Sometimes I have been great, and other times I have been insensitive, but my wife has said that she doesn’t know how I have put up with her and I deserve a medal. When you love someone, you do what’s necessary. In the last twelve months, my tolerance has been pushed to the breaking point. I feel as though my love, my support and understanding has been thrown back in my face. I don’t want a prize I want to feel loved and cherished and not alone. My wife has said terrible things to me that have hurt me to the core, and I am now reassessing my marriage and our feelings towards each other. I have withdrawn from her both physically and emotionally. I don’t believe my wife will be worried about the lack of sex because our sex life has declined significantly over the last five years. I have tried to address this issue by being patient, understanding and not putting any pressure on her. I have reached a point where I don’t want sex anymore, and that is so unlike me because I love making love to her and being intimate. But I’ve been rejected so many times, it destroys my confidence and hurts too much. I have told my wife how I am feeling, but the situation doesn’t improve. I know you cannot ask or expect someone to change (unless they want to), but you can change yourself and how you deal with situations. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in a marriage where I am not happy most of the time (eighty twenty rule). Lately, I find excuses not to go home, and I reduce the amount of time I spend with my wife. I work more hours, go out with friends or by myself, spend more time exercising, or I find any activity to keep me busy. I don’t feel like a married man anymore, and I feel very little connection with my wife. We used to be a team, but our love was not suffocating because we encouraged each other to go out and holiday with friends. Seeing her happy with or without me always made me happy. I love my wife, but we all have an obligation to be happy. I know there is no such thing as a perfect marriage/relationship. I just want to be loved. I am not a needy person. I don’t need to be told that I am loved every day; I don’t expect sex every day (twice a week would be lovely). I am really easy going and considerate. I just feel I have come to a point where I think we would be better off apart. I’m not interested in anyone else I would rather be lonely by myself than lonely in a relationship. So I am after any advice that will help me to save my marriage because that’s what I want, but I’m not prepared to continue like this. It’s not fair on my wife or me. I have asked my wife how she feels, and she said everything is okay, but it amazes me how she can be happy when I am not. Is this further evidence of a breakdown of communication and connection?"

Particularly in the morning when you've had not much luck sleeping at night? Also, I will randomly get a ""quick scary dream"" just as I fall asleep and it wakes me right back up into a panic... then I feel like blood rushing to my forehead in response to the startle. Possibly in the ""brain zap"" category.. but it's like a strong voice or vision that rattles me accompanied by a sense of doom. On a good note, my appetite seems to be returning a little. I've lost 28 lbs from pure menopausal anxiety. Actually, I believe I'm postmenopausal but the gyno put menopausal on my chart - my FSH 121 and LH 52 Estrogen wayyyy down Did not take the patch Can anyone here relate to these symptoms? Constant, extreme fear, doom, weird sleep stuff, chills when falling asleep. Thanks all and good luck"

I have gone through 2 different pelvic floor therapies (2019 and 2022) without success doing the stupid exercises that don't help. I am using since Mid-October Premarin estrogen cream for my vaginal atrophy being given for my awful urinary symptoms I was having. I haven't had my period since I started using it and I'm not pregnant. I find if I eat oatmeal I have a harder time getting stool out than if I eat junk food at times. It's soft as can be so taking a stool softner seams not the answer. It's like a smear hose where I a digging it out like it's peanut butter(not hard in most cases). I take normally everyday 3 tablespoons of the generic metamucil. I have tried splinting, it doesn't work for me at all and it's SOOOOOOOOOOO much easier to dig it out. I have tried a step stool or lifting my legs on the bathtub and that only helps once in a while. It seems that this is all related to the lack of estrogen considering before the year 2020, I wasn't having this before and not necessarily what I eat. Any advice besides the dreading drink water and eating fiber I absolutely hate? As I said, even fiber doesn't help and has gotten stuck such as oatmeal. I am not a person that can relax as I am always uptight about issues in my life so the breathing crap doesn't help. I told the physio therapist I CANNOT do deep breathing as it just stresses me the hell out even if I try to do it slowly it's like for me, being a kid again thinking ""Do I have to do this crap"" when you didn't want to do your homework at home. It's like it stresses me out that I have do a task like that, so deep breathing doesn't help me at all. I basically don't want to do these exercises and it's not helping at all. I only have had help with the urinary issues that I had problems trying to pee and that was from the estrogen cream since I tried not taking one dose once to see if that's why my weight was increasing and I was so miserable with my urinary issues I can't live without this estrogen cream. I don't know if this is menopause or the estrogen cream or something else causing my lack of menstruation. I am going to see my regular gynecologist for my yearly pap smear in a week. I got prescribed the estrogen cream from a urogynecologist. The urogyncologist saw my urethra was small and couldn't fit the cystoscope in me so that's how I got on this estrogen cream. Is there anything else besides the dreaded diet changes I can do that I am honestly only at times willing to do since for me, it's like food is my everything and I want to just eat and drink what I want in life otherwise why be on Earth if you can't be happy?"

Thinning hair, short periods, period symptoms 100 times worse, tired, etc. A year ago I stated getting burning sensations on my face and back of neck. At first it started off where i would have an episode a handful of days during the month. Then on the third month the episodes started to happen almost every day. The burning got so painful on my face and neck i had to miss work, i could leave my house. I could also feel it on my scalp. The burning sensation would last all day and sometimes continue into the next day. FYI...... I did not sweat during the episodes and my face would only turn a little pink...sometime it would not show any color. I spoke to my doctor who acted like it was nothing. He said he was anxiety and put me on anxiety meds. I knew that was not the issue. I came out of my mom's womb anxious. Two months on the pills and the episodes did not improve. I thought maybe I'm allergic to the sulfate in my hair care products so I went to all natural products but that didn't help. I finally thought what if this is a Perimenopause symptom. I looked all over the internet but all I can find only were women having burning sensations in hands and feet. Well, I have the burning sensations on my face, back of neck, left shoulder. does anyone know if this is a symptom of Perimenopause???? PLEASE HELP"
Lesley998,2012-08-14T18:55+00:00,Perimenopause and SEVERE joint pain - any one else??,"Hi I am 50 and have been in perimenopause for some time. I just wanted to post here to see if anyone else has suffered extreme joint pain as a result of fluctuating estrogen. Quick history: regular as clockwork from the age of 13 - up to and after the two pregnancies in my thirties.Then aged 47 I started to get very heavy and irregular periods. Then I went for six months with no period at all, then two very scant light periods in quick succession. I have had nothing now for two months but I do feel as if it might happen soon as sore boobs etc. I have never had a hot flush. I do however have lots of other peri symptoms, including insomnia, heart palpitations and skipped beats, and a strange 'rushing' or whooshing feeling which starts in the abdomen which I think is an 'adrenal' surge. I also have other vague and odd symptoms, dry eyes and inside my nose, and a really vile taste in my mouth sometimes - I mean really vile, like a chemical taste, unrelated to anything I have eaten. I also have odd tingling skin sometimes, which I can only describe as feeling like 'cold' sunburn! However, about the joint pain. Three months ago I literally woke up one morning with a sore left arm/elbow. Over a few days, the pain then moved into my shoulders, and I got really worried as if was incredibly painful, and showed no signs of going away, it just got worse and worse. It is worse in the morning when I wake up, I am as stiff as a board. It is on my mind 24/7. Doing normal things is almost impossible - I have problems carrying shopping, drying my hair,walking the dog, driving...everything seems to hurt . I have never suffered from arthritic pain, and I went to the doctor thinking I had some awful bone disease, or even polymyalgia. I was told I had nerve pain!! The GP was terrible and made me feel like a hypochondriac and it was all in my mind. I was told I had good range of movement, and no inflammation. But I am in agony, and i am not imagining it.I made the mistake of asking Dr.Google too, which is never a good idea as I scared myself half to death. I never even thought it could be related to hormones or menopause, as the pain was just SO bad and I had never heard of joint pain being a symptom.I mean I have read than meno can be bad for some women, and I expected hot flushes etc, but I didnt realise it meant pain like this. Anyway - for the last few weeks I have been having worsening pain which has spread from left elbow and both shoulders, into left hip, both elbows and now my knees. All my joints are cracking and popping loudly and even my husband can hear the awful grating in my neck and my knees....I sound like a one man band as I go up and down the stairs! I went In for my three yearly Cervical smear on Monday, and could hardly get up on the examining couch I was so stiff and sore. Womans health is dealt with by the Nurse Practitioners in our large practice (15 GP's) and when the NP saw my discomfort she asked me what was wrong. It turns out she has a real interest in womens health, and has been involved in HRT trials and research for many years. She informed me that my symptoms all point to fluctuating estrogen, and possible thyroid involvement. She told me a load of stuff about estrogen and cartilage, dry mucosa etc, the details of which I can't remember now but which made so much sense when she explained it - even down to the foul taste and tingling skin I have also experienced on and off for months which are both known side effects of estrogen surge as the ovaries go a bit haywire. Asmall percentage of women are very receptive to estrogen fluctuations which involve cartilage, which mainly manifest as abnormally severe joint pain/menopausal arthritis but it is not an 'obvious' symptom of perimenopause. I asked why the GP was no help, and she just raised her eyebrows when I told her which male GP it was, and told me to make another appointment as soon as possible with a specific GP (who must be more knowledgeable about womens health.) Going in tomorrow to see her. I can't do HRT as I have a heart condition, but maybe I can do estrogen cream, or phytoestrogen/soy.) It could last for a long time I guess until I come out the other side ! So i have not yet been diagnosed, but it sounds like it could be caused by estrogen. Sorry this has been so long....but anyone else out there feel the same way I do??? Lesley."

I also have been having irregular periods and breast soreness. I have extreme health anxiety, so googling sends me down terrifying rabbit holes. I went to my doctor a couple of weeks ago and he was not concerned about cancer at all, he said it was likely digestive as well as stress. But my hypochondria makes me over focus on everything and I second-guess him even though I trust him tremendously. My anxiety has gotten so bad that I asked my doctor for Ativan again a couple days ago. However when I’m looking at my symptoms, I don’t have any other issues that would make me think I have cancer or anything like that and the thought of visiting a doctor to get a scan is terrifying to me. When I got my period eight days early this week, it occurred to me I might be a perimenopausal. I am 42 years old. I went to my doctor a couple of weeks ago and he was not concerned about cancer at all, he said it was likely digestive as well as stress. But my hypochondria makes me over focus on everything and I second-guess him even though I trust him tremendously. did anyone else experience these symptoms?

lisa82546,2022-12-11T20:46+00:00,Hello,"Hello ladies I'm so glad I found this forum. I have been reading quietly for a couple of years. I am 53 and started menopause about two years ago. I didn’t even realize I was starting it except for irregular periods, and then I noticed other things that were happening and called my doctor to be tested. And, noticed I was having some hot flashes, skin changes, mainly being very dry, some changes with my hair, and of course achy joints, which I never had before. I have always had a little bit of anxiety, but nothing debilitating and nothing I couldn't get under control. when I have anxiety, I tend to get health anxiety, which seems to be the worst. I’ve always been a very healthy person, and I’ve never taken my health for granted, and I’ve always been thankful for it. So whenever I do get sick or since starting menopause, and when I do get anxiety and have the physical symptoms of anxiety, I sit and wonder and worry that every little ache or pain or tingle, is something awful and then of course you Google, and that’s the worst thing to do. I always go to my GYN for my yearly‘s, I have my mammograms and I always keep my yearly appointments with my PCP and have yearly exams and bloodwork. Everything always checks out OK and for the most part I feel OK and can deal with the minor symptoms of menopause. but, then there are those times when I have like a week of two really bad symptoms or for example I have a desk job and sitting down at a desk job 8 to 9 hours a day does a number on you anyway, I try to get up and move around as much as I can. last week we had a really bad and busy week at work and I just felt my back was sore. My arm was sore and I was starting to get some tingling all the way from my face all the way down to my hand on the left side which I’ve had before and has happened many times before and there’s no doubt that I could have bad posture from sitting at a desk, I could have a pinched nerve, and some degenerative changes with my spine from age. But I automatically think the worst. I start wondering if I’m having heart problems or a heart attack or somethings going on like MS or brain tumors or any kind of cancer for that matter. It’s just awful and takes over your mind 24 seven. and, I come here and read everyone’s stories and experiences, and while I would never put off finding out, if something was really wrong with me, and I don’t really feel that there is, other than this being menopause, and experiencing the same symptoms so many are experiencing. It’s crazy how hormones can make you feel so many different ways and calls so many different symptoms. I apologize for any typos I am typing on my iPhone."

I feel as if I can't speak while this is happening, and have to wait for it to pass. It's really scary, I feel very anxious, and always boiling hot, sweating afterwards. During these 3 or 4 days I always get this feeling as I'm dropping off to sleep also and wake up in a panic, again sweating. It happens through the night aswell, I wake regularly feeling panic and anxious then sweating again. The first 2 times it happened I actually passed out, but in the last 2 years since I have only had the weird feeling and not lost consciousness.

k10215,2022-11-30T00:27+00:00,racing heart in the middle of the night wakes me,"Hi, I have been having episodes where i wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing. Its a steady beat, not erratic and it is usually 100-115 beats per minute. They last 3-15 minutes. No other symptoms just the heart going faster and at a steady pace. I have no notices of afib on apple device or fitbit. They happened 1-2 times a week starting late October and are now happening almost nightly. I have read on menopause boards this can be common but it is really scaring me. Does anyone have any issues like this and did it turn out to be menopause symptoms, a heart issue or anxiety? I have gone to the cardiologist and currently and 14 days into a event monitor, started anti anxiety meds which greatly have helped and cut down episodes. I get a ton of blood tests end of the week as the dr is testing thyroid, hormones, adrenals, etc. Thank you for any responses:)"

sakura26,2022-11-27T20:12+00:00,Anyone tried PRP ovarian rejuvenation treatment for menopause?,"Hi, I've been looking into PRP ovarian rejuvenation treatment. Although it may only last 7 to 12 months and I'm not trying to have a child, I'm desparate for anything to return my hormone levels to normal. HRT supplementation can't seem to balance me out and I'm having horrible anxiety every few weeks and can barely function. I had existing PTSD and my doctor says peri and menopause do raise anxiety as our hormones are too low or out of balance and we produce extra cortisol. She's had me on progesterone cream, pills etc. and it's impossible to find the right recipe so something like PRP treatment if it works and is safe would be a miracle for me. Even if it lasts 7 months that's 7 months of relief from this nightmare and buys me time to look into other therapies or maybe I repeat it. I know other startups on working on trying to reverse menopause (not so we can have children at 90 but so we can feel normal and avoid the serious health issues of menopause- dementia, heart, anxiety etc.). If any of you ladies have tried PRP please let me know! I looked into melatonin treatment as well but sadly I can't tolerate melatonin as it makes me more anxious. Thanks so much! 😃"

I have been on HRT since February and am now stable on Oestrogel & Utrogestan (i started on patches but they weren't working very well), i am also taking the contractive pill, progesterone only (Desogestrel), which i take to stop periods only as i am sterilised so don't have to worry about getting pregnant. I am also due a gynaecology appointment on 6th December as i am not producing testosterone at all so need that prescribing, i don't think that is related to my issue though? So I have started spotting; now this hasn't happened in a long time so you can imagine my annoyance! But i am now in week 2 of this and so i am wondering if there's any point in carrying on taking the pill as seemingly its not working in stopping bleeding? I also have no idea how to stop the bleeding and it doesn't seem to be letting up. It may be worth noting that I had really bad pain the week before anything happened. has anyone else experienced this? or does anyone have any words of wisdom as i'm royally fed up with it now!"

Hence, you are going to feel soooo... much better and eventually the symptoms will subside? How many times has your doctor stated: Now that you're in post-menopause, you will feel like your old self again, you will feel like you're in your 30s! WTH! Shut the front door and call me Mary! Well, I, Vivian 72688, have to REFUTE the accuracy of those statements immensely! That said, they do NOT apply to me, and are soooo... FAR FROM THE TRUTH! When I entered this last stage, my POST-MENOPAUSAL symptoms got WORSE! Anxiety-overload is how I describe my life, in this last stage!! Suffice it to say, I eat right, take high-end vitamins, exercise, etc.. and I have noticed this TSUNAMI PUSHES its way through ALL those STELLAR things I listed!! It is evident, menopause FORCES its way through ALL things good; and maybe, just maybe, because it is a NATURAL time in our lives, and unfortunately, we must endure the unwanted suffering, trauma, and unpredictable PSYCHOTIC episodes!

ALSO A MESSAGE TO ALL MEN DONT GIVE UP ON HER SHE NEEDS YOU EVEN IF SHE IS RAGING AT YOU DONT TAKE IT PERSONAL SHE IS GOING THROUGH A PROCESS IM SURE AFTER IT PASSES SHE WILL REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE STUCK BY HER AND THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT IT IS ALSO AN EXPERIENCE THAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM TO GROW. AND IF SHE HAS CARRIED YOUR CHILDREN TO HOW DARE YOU GIVE UP ON HER AFTER WHAT SHE HAS GONE THROUGH FOR YOU AND YES SEX IS A MAIN THING THAT MEN LOOK FOR AND HENCE IF THEY DONT GET ANY THEN RELATIONSHIP CAN GO DOWN HILL BUT IM SURE SHE WILL REALIZE THAT YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH IT WITH HER IF NOT THEN ITS ALSO OKAY. but would like to here from those who have gone through the same experiences or symptoms as im gathering info to understand whats going on."

I started having intermittent shortness of breath at first, I thought it was COVID -- but no. Also having heartburn from hell, just overall feeling really unwell. (I have lost over 40 lbs) I know that these can be underlying symptom of many things... sooo since this has began I have been to many specialists, lots of blood tests, had 2 ER trips because I thought I was dying, several EKGs, abdominal ultrasound, 3 chest x-rays, CATSCAN and upper endoscopy. ALL NORMAL! Some doctors have even used the word EXCELLENT. While all this is very good news that they could not find anything wrong with me, the bad news.... still feel sick but now I just don't know why. In my younger years my period was always 5-6 days long, very regular... Now I am still very regular but my period is only 2 days now. For some reason none of these doctors (all men) could really weigh in on any advice about early perimenopause, I also felt like their minds just snapped shut to the idea because of my age. I have not been to an OBGYN in 5 years and have an appointment next week, but after a year of this crap I am feeling really hopeless that even they wont be able to help. I have already been sifting through posts about this topic and am seeing I am not alone.

Alongside this I started experiencing a whole host of other symptoms including weakness in my right arm, heaviness in my limbs, pins and needles, jaw pain and really bad anxiety / stress and irritability. I have lost count of the number of times I have contacted the doctor. They have done blood tests including a full blood count, vitamin levels, thyroid and rheumatoid arthritis. The only thing that showed up was low ferritin and I have been taking iron supplements for that. They keep fobbing me off with anxiety and because of all the symptoms, my health anxiety has gone through the roof! I can never guarantee where I will have aches and pains from one day to the next (which is why I think the doctors won't believe me). Currently my jaw pain is through the roof. The dentist has said I have TMJ and has made me a soft splint, which isn't really helping. My neck and shoulder muscles are so tight all of the time. My stomach feels swollen and although I'm having regular periods, they are nothing like my usual cycle. I also have palpitations and random muscle twitches! I sometimes think I'm going mad with it all. I have done three FSH urine tests which I ordered myself and they were all positive, but my doctor refuses to believe that I am in perimenopause because of my age (even though my mum went through it at 38).

I am almost scared of going to bathroom only to see brown spots again. and bladder leakage- urgency to pee... sigh.. .. i've also noticed maybe its hot flash in middle of night, like surge of heat and like period might come, that type of weird feeling.... i have appt next week with gynecologist and might go for hysteroscopy soon, again, I am very scared.... just wondering if any of you have spotting problem ?? thank you very much for your time"

Told him I thought I was perimenopausal, felt rubbish and had a whole load of symptoms. He asked me to tell him the symptoms and I said there were loads and asked if he wanted me to list them. He said yes. I started listing them and before I was even close to being finished he interrupted and started telling me I was wrong and none of my symptoms were related to peri menopause. I explained that in addition to the long list of symptoms, I had no kids, have had 3 rounds of IVF, and already had a low ovarian reserve to begin with (confirmed at the IVF centre when I was in my mid 20s, around 13 years ago). He said that he had read my notes and I had no fertility issues, and our fertility issues were due to my husband. I explained that I knew that but that I was referring to my ovarian reserve and not fertility issues. He said it’s definitely not perimenopause, might be thyroid. Told me to book a phlebotomist appointment. Call ended after 6 minutes. By that time I was crying. That’s why I don’t book doctors appointments and have just accepted feeling rubbish. Anyone experienced similar? If so, what did you do? Any GPs reading this with any advice? Is there any hope or do I just have to accept that this is my life now, an old lady at 38?

Thank you Despina"

To give a brief background, I stopped menstruating in April 2022. I was actually looking forward to it for several reasons...saving money, not having the inconvenience at work, etc. In early August I had what is called a flash period. It was so sudden and unusually heavy that I could not leave my house the first day because I was bleeding through each hour. My period was five days instead of seven. Fast forward to now, I am having the following symptoms: insomnia (very little sleep the past three nights), migraine, tintinus, unexplained brusing, and excessive sweating. I'll spare you the details, but suffice it to say, I'd probably be asked to unboard a plane until I freshened up. Has anyone else experienced any of these symptoms? Are there any effective natural remedies? I just don't know if any of this should warrant a doctor's visit. Thank you in advance for your insight and advice."

In May this year and for the last four months I have been so overwhelmed with what's happening that I've locked myself away. Some of my symptoms are so odd that I still think there is something else going on. recurrent utis.. ended up on IV antibiotics. At first I began to put all my symptoms down to utis because they are similar, aches and pains, back aches etc but it wasn't. I'm now on Hiprex which is working so at least I don't need antibiotics any more finges crossed but I think it.s making me very nauseous or of course that could be hormones. I feel so neurotic listing my symptoms but they are constant flu like symptoms groin pain and inner thigh pain - very bad aching and feels like nerve pain as well feeling sick/nausea bursts of sadness and sobbing my fatigue and aching is so bad I can barely do any exercise.. last night I felt ok so walked around the block dragging period type pain lower abdomen burning sore eyes Terrible facial pallor with dark rings under my eyes 4 months ago I was heading on holiday (cancelled, rebooked cancelled due to symptoms), waked 5 miles a day, loads of energy. There was nothing wrong with me. I seem to be doing things later on rather than in the peri stage. All my bloods are ok except obviously oestrogen. Ultrasounds and CTs also fine. I'm doing everything I should do, with HRT on the backburner I react badly to everything so still pondering on this. All my girlfriends are in denial and won't talk about the menopause which has shocked me. I am single no kids so wonder what the hell it was all for. I have cancelled pretty much all my summer. Keep pulling out at last minute. Can anyone relate? The aching is so bad it makes me sob. I'm covering myself in cannabis oil which is helping slightly. I never thought my life would become so small and isolated. Not to be well enough to travel or exercise....Thanks in advance."

eve92484,2022-09-04T11:40+00:00,Symptoms only in Follicular Phase (leading up to ovulation),"I've researched high and low and am at my wits end. For 3 years now, since my son was born, I have been experiencing horrible symptoms in the first two weeks of my cycle, from period leading up to ovulation. I am moody, depressed, sometimes lightheaded, fatigued, headaches, head tension / sore behind eyes, leg aching. It lifts after ovulation and despite always having PMS before this, I feel great in my luteal phase. It’s like switching from black and white back in to technicolour. I am 35, I have low AMH (1.85pmol) and high FSH for my age (10.5). I am TTC also to no avail tor 18months, I do not know if this is connected. I’ve been told my hormones are low; Day 3-5 Estrogen 89-120pmol, Day 21 bloods show Progesterone between 26-40 nmol and Estrogen between 290-400 pmol. I’ve tested these many months. I have Hashimotos and mildly under active thyroid which I’m medicated for, only identified this year. I am looking to see if anyone has experienced this or if you can point me in the right direction as to what this could be? My own theories are: Low Estrogen, struggling to rise adequately and experiencing symptoms of low Estrogen in follicular phase when it should be high. Maybe I’m approaching perimenopause and sensitive to changes. As Estrogen rises it could be increasing TBG and causing hypothyroid symptoms. I have come across three other women complaining of this in thyroid forums but couldn’t get in touch with them, and two were also in perimenopause. Estrogen dominance - I am technically this but the symptoms I read about always refer to luteal phase, not early in cycle. I cannot put up with this forever, this is affecting my life so much, I would appreciate any help or insights. I’ve been to Endocrinologist, Doctors etc. to no avail. I just keep getting told that all women having to put up with hormone fluctuations. I had a difficult delivery, an induced labour when my son was born as well as blood loss, a transfusion and anaemia. I don't know if any of these things could have triggered this."

hilary72843,2022-08-24T22:23+00:00,A rollercoaster I want to get off,"I started with menopause at 47 (I’m 50) and it was really ‘just’ hot flashes, low mood and sleep problems. My GP is hugely supportive and we decided to try HRT. I settled on Elleste Duet which was great. Then it went out of stock and I was given Kliofem, which was okay but my symptoms returned. So I tried gel oestrogen and utrogestan. Again I settled and all seemed well. But in September 20. I had what I can only describe as a menopause storm - severe waves of doom, jitters, adrenaline surges. fear, hot and cold flashes, nausea, bloating, digestive issues, sleep problems, aching joints, air hunger… the list goes on and on. (Bloods and scans are normal by the way.) I upped my dose of gel but to no avail. But I levelled out again only to get covid in January 2021. I was very unwell with the gastric version of the virus and it threw my hormones out of whack. So a lot of my menopausal symptoms returned. I felt I wasn't absorbing the gel especially as the dose increase didn't help at all. . So I had a consult with my GP who agreed and I went back on Elleste. Since then I’ve been largely okay until recently when I had another spell of these dreadful and varying symptoms. It’s so random as they can come without warning and at any time day or night. I feel ghastly, lost and just wired wrongly. It’s very debilitating and spoils outings and time with friends and family. My anxiety is also through the roof as I’m terrified of having an episode and that anxiety adds fuel to the fire when it comes to my symptoms and I make myself feel worse. Plus, I convince myself that there's something hugely wrong with me. I am concerned at how badly women like me suffer with menopause and how ill prepared I was for it. I do talk to lots of people about their experiences & find sharing helps me feel less alone and that I’m not bonkers. But it is such a difficult road to travel and I hope someone out there relates to my story. Please."

Any advice.","Hello Ladies, Click here to view image ?I have been peri menopausal for I believe 4 years now. It started with terrible night sweats for a few months. Then my periods were erratic and heavy. I went to my GP had blood test which indicated I was going through ""The Change"". My mother was in her late 50's but had her last child at 43where as I started my periods at 11 and had byh my children by the time I was 22 and by the time I was 25 my husband had a  vasectomy so I no longer took birth control. I had just 3 periods last year. ?I had hot flushes up to twenty times a day, I woke up multiple times in the night either very hot or very cold so did not have a good nights sleep. I gave up drinking Alcohol for January and I believe this has had a profound effect on my symptoms. I have maybe one or two hot flushes and sleep like a baby most nights. I have given up sugar and cut out rice, bread pasta and potatoes and I have lost 8lbs in the last two weeks. But unfortunately I still feel dizzy and have tingly weak arms and legs,sinus pain behind my eyes and nose, indigestion and a sensation of someone flicking me with an elastic band in different areas of my body. When I have a new symptom I convince myself that it is just a part of Peri menopause or I will drive myself insane! ?I have been to the doctors at least 6 times in the last 5 months and had numerous test so I believe I am not dying of anything but it still takes will power to not be scared of every little ache and pain.

Catgirl,2022-08-17T10:40+00:00,Uterine Hyperplasia Found,"What my doctor initially thought she saw on a TVU turned out to be uterine hyperplasia when she looked at it more closely during a Hysteroscopy. She also took a biopsy and I'm awaiting results as to if it's the atypical kind that can cause cancer. She said my choices if it is not the cancer type is progesterone and a repeat biopsy in 3 months to check things or a hysterectomy if it's the pre cancer type. I am 51 and beginning menopause without a period since the end of May although I started some type of bleeding (it may be a light period) this past Sunday. I was told I have too much estrogen at the moment which I knew since I have been having copious amounts of cervical mucus since my periods stopped in May. I suspected something wasn't right and decided to further investigate. Is there anyone out there who has been through this and can offer advice? I am really overwhelmed with all of this at the moment as I am a cancer survivor (thyroid 2008) and I really hate hearing the words cancer and surgery. By the way, the biopsy hurt like crazy. I thought I was going to pass out. They told me to take 2 Advil before my appointment but they really should have knocked me out. I am not looking forward to repeating that procedure in 3 months if indicated!"

I had a partial hysto in 2006. the rest was taken out about 4 years ago. I've have horrendous hot flashes, like crazy intense on fire hot flashes, my hair has been failing out for quite some time now but no wig yet, my skin is like a leather handbag left out in the Sahara desert forever. I have the worst gas I've ever had. I don't go out in public unless i have too, its that bad. I've had major depression and anxiety my whole life but it has reached bottom levels. Obviously my hair, skin, gas has increased my depression and anxiety. I once went to a gyn about HRT but I'm scared about the side effects, heart, cancer etc. but didn't cover a whole lot because I was against it at that time but I am getting to the point where I'm considering it which scares me even more. I've seen comments about patches being safer. Does insurance cover them, is it expensive? I'm at a crossroad right now. Do I live with these awful symptoms or do I risk my health and increase anxiety? Any comments welcome."

I guess that's a sure sign of low.... everything. Am I right in saying this? If it's been over a year with no period, then I am postmenopausal.

I am 51 years old and haven't had a period since the end of May. After that period I started having constant thick ovulation like mucus (I have to wear a heavy menstrual pad, it's that copious), sore breasts and a weird pulling pain in my lower right hip and lower back after standing after sitting for a long time (like a long car ride). I also have been having some intermittent pins and needles in my lower legs and feet. My period in April lasted super long with alot of spotting before that period. I went to my gyno in April and had a clean TV ultrasound and pap smear. My pap showed signs of atrophy (estrogen falling) which I was told was normal for someone ""my age"". Fast forward to last week...I went to my gyno over the mucus, sore breasts and hip/back discomfort. She did another TV Ultrasound and said she saw what looks like 2 uterine polyps and an ovarian cyst. She said they ""look"" benign but insisted I have a procedure in her office which I will do this Tuesday where they will inject saline into my uterus, look with a camera and possibly biopsy the polyps/area. She told me that the hip/back issues are not related and to see a neurologist which I'm doing on 8/22. I am a nervous wreck! My mind goes to cancer immediately especially since my periods have seemed to stop. I'm very worried over the cyst. Anyone have any advice or a similar situation they can share?"

Throughout your menopausal journeys, more than likely, each of you has experienced some VERY STRANGE symptoms, I know I have. One year alone, I FELL five times; these anomalies came out of nowhere. I didn't misstep or trip over anything, I just FELL. I attributed the falls to: Drum Roll Puhleeze: Imbalanced Hormones! That said, that part of my menopausal journey ceased, thank GOD!! Another strange symptom I endured was the recurring of the same INTRUSIVE thoughts, which were relentless! I am slowly recovering form them!

I don't know what's happening to me but it all started on May 2022 that I feel nausea and vomiting and light-headedness. I think I had my period on that day so I thought maybe it's because I have a heavy period. So from that I anticipated that it will go away as soon as my period ends, but no. I was so worried, I insisted to my partner that I need to take a blood test because I think I'm anemic. So we went to test, and then we got the results. My doctor interpreted the results so she said it was normal. I was happy that it was not anemia but still worried the fact that I still feel light-headed. My partner thinks that maybe my eyes have astigmatism that's why I feel LH. So we went to an optalmologist and I had a new eyeglasses. At first I was feeling dizzy and light-headed while wearing it but days passed and my lightheadedness was gone. So I'm a little convinced that it was an eye problem. But June and July passed I feel lightheaded again. So I'm wondering. Why??? Why do I feel it again??? I'm starting to worry again. Now it's August 3 and it started again yesterday. Right now I feel very weird, my stomach is acting up, it feels warm. I have an urge to take deep breaths and at the same time I fell lightheaded. Sometimes my anxiety triggers all of this. Do you guys have an idea what's happening to me?? Please help.🙁"
suzybear61,2018-02-18T09:22+00:00,Ovestin cream - long term?,"Last year I was having numerous urinary infections resulting in numerous antibiotics. I googled urinary infections during menopause and oestrogen cream was mentioned. I suggested this to my female G.P. who prescribed it for me.  I used it as per instructions - it stopped the UTI’s, stopped the vaginal itching and soreness and just made me feel comfortable and confident.  As I don’t want to go down the systemic HRT route I thought this was the answer to my menopause problems.  The instruction leaflet recommend using the cream for 3 months and then having a break and assessment with GP.  My male GP told me that long term use carries so many risks - and more or less said that uti’s, soreness, thinning and discomfort were natural so just kind of get on with it!  I was so frightened of his warnings I stopped using the cream. 3 weeks later I felt the familiar discomfort and urinary urgency returning - so reluctantly and nervously used the cream - within 2 days I was back to normal again!  I am really unsure about using the cream following my doctors’ warnings despite the fact the Ovestin cream makes my undercarriage so much happier!   I would welcome any advice or alternatives to my dilemma - comfort vs risks??"

I even have this quote inscribed on my favorite wine glass. ""I'm very definitely a woman and I enjoy it!"" ~Marilyn Monroe Let's just say, I'm still very definitely a woman but I don't enjoy it any more lately. Sex has become a chore for me now. I know it's one of those things I have to do as a wife. Sometimes it's very painful and others times it's just very exhausting. With this constant bloating, gas and pain in my right side, I don't feel very sexy. Afterwards, I typically like to cuddle, but that's become impossible because laying on my side is so uncomfortable and I'm usually too exhausted to appreciate the cuddles.

It all started with excruciating hip pains during my periods. I couldn't sleep on my sides during those times without waking up in agony. Two years later my hair fell out. The crown of my head was near bald, so I had to wear wigs for two years. I went to see a dermatologist and she diagnosed me with CCCA (Central, Centrifugal, Cicatricial, Alopecia). She also prescribed a steroid and suggested I use Minoxidil. I opt to use either of those and chose a strong biotin supplement instead. My hair grew back completely after two years, but the texture of my hair changed significantly. Two years later, I began to experience a lot of bloating, burning sensations in my stomach, pain under my ribs (on the right side) and lots of gas. I spoke with my GP and she suggested it was a muscle strain, so she suggested I take pain medication for relief. I knew this was not a muscle strain, but I was hopeful. Eight months later, I went to see her again. This time she told me I was full of s**t! (Well not that direct. She actually said, I have a lot of stools) So, she suggested I use Miralax; the one with the purple cap. (She put emphasis on the purple cap). I am typically regular, so I was confused by her diagnosis, but I was hopeful. I used the Miralax for a week and nothing changed. Still, I can't sleep on my right side without feeling like there's something there. ( I fear it's a mask) I'm always bloated and gassy and all the worry has cause my hair to fall out again. I just purchased a new wig and I'm officially a back sleeper. Still, I'm hopeful! Hang in there ladies!! Uploading file...Uploading file..."

I always think the worst. I'm always thinking somethings wrong. I'm tired even though i sleep. My stomach is a mess. I'm anxious and on edge just about every day. I don't feel like my happy self which is upsetting me. I'm worried about getting older. I still have a small child left at home he's 8 and my world. I will be 45 in November.

Sometimes I'll even have a finger or toe jerk. (I've tried taking a magnesium/calcium combination over the past two months; no effect.) I think I'm in perimenopause. I'm 49 years old and my periods have been extremely heavy and starting to get irregular. About two years ago I started developing pain and it has really escalated (especially in my legs), but the thing that really stresses me out is the twitching. I don't want to go the doctor with this just yet; I've already spent countless hours at doctors' offices and labs (for a facial neuralgia) and I don't want to go through that stress all over again just now. Does anyone else get this twitching (or ever had it), and do you have any thoughts to share about it? Thanks in advance for any thoughts at all."

sakura26,2020-01-13T00:24+00:00,Can Menopause cause tooth pain???,I grind my teeth but have a mouth guard and recently 3 weeks ago I developed this ongoing tooth pain. I went to the dentist and an endodontist (twice) and the endo thought that it was due to teeth grinding and my night guard being a bit off since xrays etc looked normal and other tap tests. So he adjusted the guard and I thought I was better Friday (saw him thursday) but then started hurting sat afternoon again and this morning was really bothering me. I've been eating on the other side and avoiding hard foods. Yet even talking too long seems to aggravate it (like work meetings). I did have some peri hormone rush nightmares last night but those aren't every night. The pain is really stressing me out as well as being distracting. I do my best to take care of my teeth and gums and really want to preserve them especially since I lost a molar last year due to an old crown cracking. Am trying to save up 4k to replace it. So need other teeth to be okay. ANYWAY. QUESTION: Someone told me that menopause (I'm in peri) can increase tooth sensitivity. Has anyone experienced this and found a remedy? I did go to the chiropractor today and she massaged my jaw muscles which were painful but tooth pain didn't completely disappear so still terrified.

mary76311,2022-06-21T12:12+00:00,"Fells like bladder infection but Doctor says no, I'm ok","I wrote this to answer the many ladies on this forum who ask about this condition. I am 65, post menopause but still hotflashes, stif, soar.... In 50's, some 60's I I developed a bladder problem; have to urinate every 20 minutes. Doctors said nothing wrong. I found that not concentrating on it helped and I think it was a fibroid which eventually dissolved on its own; the problem went away. I also realized that our skin, including ALL places gets dry in older years. Wiping with toilet paper too hard, paper with chemicals, perfumes... in it, sex, washing underwear and even pants in soap, detergents, bleach can irritate the skin and this irritates the outer nerves and this travels to the bladder nerves. Makes feeling of need to constant urinate Also; cracked, irritated skin can make you feel like you have a bladder infection (stinging...) but you don't, it never get worse. Same for bath, shower; use only the pure Glycerin... type soaps. Wash underwear, pants in PURE glycerin soap. Bar or liquid. True one is 100% clear. Some are fake. Avoid ones with citrate... added. Some Amish soaps are also good. Put 100% pure FULL FAT (nothing added, no fruit...) Greek Yogurt up into your vagina using a empty Monistat type tube. It helps. I also use probiotics to swallow and open a capsule and use as a powder in underwear. Always check with a doctor to be sure."

I'm 50 and it all started in March, I was super nervous about this pandemic and one day I felt my body burning for hours and hours like somebody poured gasoline on me followed by chills and body pain. I got so scared when it first started that I thought that I got the virus, I went to the hospital and since there was no fever they didn't test me for covid 19. I need to say that I have had hot flashes in the last 2 years but they never really bothered me and never like in March. Went to see My obgyn. and she told me I'm perimenop. and prescribed remifemin which took a while to help but it only helps me a 70 % I still have not so mild hot flashes. And right there, right after the severe hot flashes episode my stomach problems started: severe abdominal pain, gas, bloating, nausea, fullness feeling, loss of appetite and I have also lost 20 lbs and I keep loosing weight, I look very bony. To relieve the pain I started blending my meals and I still do it to this day. The GI doctor ordered an endoscopy, I have gastritis acid reflux and hiatal hernia, he prescribed omeprazole 40 mg since May and it's doing anything, I feel my symptoms are getting worse, I'm in so much pain I'm eating 5 small cups of blended meals a day, I'm in constant pain and bloating, gassy, nausea and it gets worse a little before, during and after my period. I've been telling my GI doctor that I feel worse and all he says is ""keep taking the medicine"". now since last week I feel more acid in my mouth than before and my throat started burning since 3 days ago especially when I have my meals. On top of that I feel really anxious. I really don't know what to do or think, I feel so alone and very sick. is this part of perimenopause? what should I do? who I need to see? is hormone replacement therapy safe and do they make the gastritis go away? I don't know what to do please help, I don't wanna die."

For a few weeks I have been smelling cigarette smoke, but no one in my household smokes.  At first, I thought it was the new neighbors next door, but nobody there smokes either.  I use Symbicort & Flonase for my “menopause asthma” and thought that the smoke smell could be a side effect of those drugs.  I remember when I was pregnant I had an irrational sense of smell, I could smell things nobody else could.  I am wondering if this smelling of cigarette smoke is yet another side effect of hormone imbalance.  Just throwing it out there - I looked online and there can be some sinister causes like epilepsy, brain tumors etc.  but I am not going to let my anxiety run wild with this - just thought I would ask -"
c14889,2022-05-06T18:17+00:00,Does anyone else feel paranoid and have OCD type symptoms?,"Hello everyone! I think I must be in year 6-7 of my perimenopause journey. My FSH is 14.4 (16 means I am biologically in menopause so I'm told). The roller coaster seems to be getting better, but not 100% better. Honestly, I'm just so glad that it is better. It was so horrible for a while that I thought I may not make it. I felt like I was dying. Do any of you, for lack of better words, just feel paranoid sometimes? I start to think no one likes me, I don't have any friends, like ""Is she mad at me?"" high school type stuff. Uggghh! I wasn't even like that then. I'm super sensitive and I feel like I have OCD symptoms at different times in my cycle. I'm ready for this part to be done, but I hope it gets smoother. Thank you ladies! Your love and feedback has made this process so much easier! XOXOXOXO"

A couple of months ago I missed a period and then my next one came when it was due. This time instead of being heavy I had a steady flow for about 12 days before easing off. Since then every day I have had brown discharge, Not enough for a pad but just when I wipe and it is only once a day, Can anyone tell me if this is normal.

Recently, I was chatting with a friend of mine regarding the DREADDED menopause. Our conversation intensified when we discussed how our mothers got through this HELL ON EARTH in one piece!! (If they truly did, and just FAKED their unhappiness in front of their husbands and offspring, and possibly took their RAGE out on others) That being said, how did your mother explain IT to you? Did she sugarcoat it, gloss over it, or just totally avoided the conversation with you? My friend and I are amazed at the countless numbers of mothers, who told their daughters, that menopause is THE CHANGE, and don't worry about it, you will get through it . WTH!! The Change? Hell to the naw! It is MORE than a change, it is a friggin TSUNAMI! Soooo... ladies, how did your mom describe menopause to you? Let me know your thoughts.."

Sesha777,2016-07-05T06:53+00:00,I'm 65 years old and still bleeding occasionally. Anyone else in my age group still bleeding?,"I have seen at least 3 different doctors. General Practice, Naturopath and OB-GYN's; but no one will say if I am in menopause. They only stress that a woman my age should not be bleeding. I've had pap smears (normal); ultrasound (normal); transvaginal ultrasound (normal) and an endometrial biopsy last year. One of the OB-GYN's looked me in my face and told me that the test results came back and I had cancer. I looked at him and told him I did not. He was livid at my suggestion that he could be wrong. He had already scheduled an appointment for me with an Oncologoist for a consultation which angered me even more, because he did not have a right to assume I would be agreeable to this. He finally said, the definitive diagnosis would come from UCLA. I waited and when it came, I DID NOT have cancer. I respect the profession; but they will not dictate how my life will be lived nor what I will believe about my own health. I wasn't in denial. I just knew that my body had no cancer. When things are wrong, we as women really know it...and we will seek the help and hopefully, the right advice.  I really hope to hear from others if you are in my age group or older and are still bleeding. The doctors have been taught to assume that this is not normal; therefore, it must be cancer."

Life as i once knew it will never be the same, i feel like im living in purgatory day after day....leading in to year after year, every month seems to keep getting worse! This horrible journey began for me 6 years ago when i was still in my 30s, i would pray every week that things would get better or after my period went away i would feel a little better...i can say this i havent seen a period in over 200 days and i feel worse! Over the years i have tried antidepressants (made things worse) tried hormones (made things worse) tried eating a little better (didnt notice any difference), tried vitamins with no change, tried probiotic and noticed no difference.....i have even been in counseling for 5 years in case its ""all in my head"".....nothing has helped me. My days now constist of waking up every morning not wanting to get out of bed, i drag myself to my bathroom to take my bath, i look in the mirror and see a bony sick lady who looks twice her age staring back at me. I try to force myself to eat throughout the day (im lucky if i get 4 bites in me), then for the next 12 hours i fight nausea and lower gut gurgling while the food attempts to digest, i feel tired and so depressed, i cant go any place or else my anxiety explodes, i cant feel happy about anything cause my stomach hurts, my head hurts, i feel lightheaded/dizzy, i have a ringing in my ears, i have lost most of my sense of taste, i have NO sex drive, i have facial twitches that i had never had before in my life, insomnia at times, my skin and hair are so dry nothing helps it.....and after having several medical tests the dr tells me ""You are a completely healthy woman""! This is not healthy and i feel as though menopause has taken so much from me. I feel like im in the movie groundhog day where im reliving the same nightmarish day over and over, nothing is changing! I am so sorry all of you strong women have to suffer with this same problem as i do....they should label it a disease not a transition!"

I’ve even tried (not too hard to the point of being weird or pushy) to flirt a little, pay compliments to a guy within a reasonable age and just ..nothing..Worse yet (which probably sealed the depression deal for me) was that I was out with what I’d call a “mixed”bunch of ladies..some older, some younger (I’m 46), short, tall, blondes, brunettes, pretty and average, and just about all of them got drinks bought for them or a little flirty conversation and I got ZERO!! Do they smell my eggs drying up as I speak!!? I’m relatively (lol) normal, attractive, funny, good conversationalist so what is the deal??

ENT say they cant do anything more. I'm now doing vestibular exercises and have tried everything. Reducing caffeine, salt, alcohol, guided meditation, acupuncture, massage, sertraline. Nothing is helping. My last resort is to trial HRT. Has anyone had similar experiences? This is wrecking my life 😥"

Basically, I am almost 51 and my periods have been regular as clockwork except for one that was 3 weeks late last summer, then a hiccup this January / February, when I had 4 normal periods in 2 months. I was ok until my last period which was about 3 weeks late again. Every month I get bloating as part of PMT. I aslo thought I was getting heartburn every month, until I read it's description and realised my burning pain is in my stomach, not my chest. Last month my bloating and burning pain didn't subside when my period started and I am still suffering it weeks later and wondering when my next period will start! When I read a description of Gastritis, I realised it was what I may have had for many months, but usually only during the week before my period. The worst symptom is the gnawing, empty, burning pain in my stomach. I feel so uncomfortable and look 10 months pregnant at times! There's also the weird feeling of being empty and hungry within 20 minutes of eating a proper meal and feeling full. This, too, is another pointer to Gastritis, but I'm holding off going to see the doctor. Anybody else getting this? My other main peri symptom is a sort of hot flush that lasts hours - I overheat far too readily, but not necessarily sweat. It's all so uncomfortable and does nothing for my self confidence!"

Right now, I'm dealing with cold chills mixed with heat waves, numbness in different parts of my body, the feeling of being zapped on the inside of my body, cracking joints. One of the worst is a crushing exhaustion. This totally sucks! Overall, my good days are coming more often. I'm about 80% good and 20% bad, which is a vast improvement. Still, when things are bad, they are as severe as ever! I do my best to put my symptoms on the back burner, but it's tough to ignore them. Any peri warriors experiencing anything similar? I turn 54 later this year, and my periods have spaced out beyond 100 days."

My symptoms seem to change daily. I'm in the middle of a god awful period and can't move off the sofa. My periods are still regular but very heavy (clots tmi) . Last week was digestive issues,which yet again sent me to the Dr's convinced I had bowel cancer. it's so draining. I have 4 children and have never worried or had anxiety until a couple of years ago. I'm very clear minded but the week before my period, I actually think I'm dying. I have intermittent tooth ache in different teeth. How! I get aching muscles like I've done an extreme workout. I wish I could be bothered! Sex is a no go most of the time. My poor hubbie. oh last week I had, what I think it was anyway, a panic attack on the motorway. A route I do all the time, but literally thought I was going to crash. I had to get to the next turn off and drive the remaining route on the A roads. I love driving, but it just completely overtook every part of my body and I felt out of control. Insomnia. just wow. Previously slept like a baby. Now I'm happy to get a few hours. The other bummer is alcohol. a glass of wine is fine, anything more and I'm sick all day. Brain fog. I literally feel in a daze most of the time i feel like im a joke to my friends. Noone is going through anything like this and im the hypercondriac of the group. Anyhow, my Dr finally took pity and has done a blood test to check my hormones. I'm desperate to try hrt so hopefully that will help. That's my moaning done. Lovely to meet you all! 😃"

PreemiePowered,2022-03-03T16:12+00:00,Mini Pill vs. Combination Pill --advice please,"So I believe I am going through Perimenopause- my doctors are sceptical because of my age (33) but I swear it explains ALL of the craziness that has consumed my life the past couple of years. Recently I have been experiencing an increase in anxiety/stress and have done some research but would like some actual feedback. I have been on the combination pill since I was 17 due to super irregular periods. Some research I've done shows where the pill can contribute to anxiety/stress levels. I am nervous about stopping the pill cold turkey due to how bad my periods were in my teen years plus my husband and I feel like we are done having kids and this is a nice way to help with that. I've tried to get feedback from my doctor about the mini pill and if it would be any better for my anxiety/stress, headaches, and other peri symptoms but haven't got much of a response. Do y'all have any advice? If I did just quiet the pill in general is there a supplement that helps regulate periods? Also, I have been having some heart flutters on and off the last couple of days, would this help with that in anyway? Just hoping for some actual feedback from people who get it and have been through it. Any other advice is appreciated. Thanks!"

This last period however started very scanty, but on the 4th day, it's like I started another period that was heavier (but not too much). This lasted 11 days from start to finish.

My main symptoms with this horrible affliction is persistent nausea, loss of appetite, indigestion, lower gut issues with anything i eat, dizzy/faint feeling, intense anxiety/depression especially around ovulation and my period, dry skin, finger joint pain, insomnia or over sleeping, exhaustion, headaches, weakness....the list can go on! i just wish this would stop torturing me, 6 years is far too long already."

Last November I hadn't had a period for nearly 2 years but I woke up and had some spotting phone my gp, whom referred me urgently to a gynaecologist, had the scan and internal one, they said my lining was a little thick nothing untoward and a little cyst on my right ovary but nothing to worry about. I then had an endometrial biopsy that cam back nothing wrong. No bleeding since but still all the normal symptoms. Then Tuesday this week I woke to horrendous period pain I thought I was in a labour and had light pink blood but only when I wiped. I rung the doctors and she said she wanted to speak to the gynaecologist and see if i need to be seen again. I'm still lightly bleeding now, but not enough to wear a pad nothing, with period pains sore boobs and craving chocolate. Has anyone had this before I am really scared. Could it be a period as my body hasn't sorted itself out yet or can it be something sinnister"

It started with my thyroid going haywire and led me to becoming hyperthyroid then to hypothyroid. but on top of that here comes declining hormones. then comes the depression and anxiety to the point of being close to suicidal and rage like a demon possessed me. I have taken ALOT of antidepressants and they just do not work. I have fought and fought, through changing my diet, walking daily, meditation, therapy etc. BUT here I am, my husband just lost it last night.....he looked in my eyes and said ""who are you"" ""I don't even know who you are"", he told me I broke him and although he didn't say the words he basically told me he does not love me anymore. I am BEYOND heartbroken and crushed. I have lost friends (have no friends now) my relationship with my grown daughter's is not what I wanted it to be, I know they walk on eggshells with me and that hurts so bad because I want to be a strong unbroken woman for them. My mother and family are sick of hearing me, so I just distanced myself. I have nothing and no one! and absolutely have no control over what is and has happened to my mind and body! I don't even recognize me! I have NEVER felt so lost and afraid. I literally have nothing, no job (husband has always provided financially, as I was caretaker to him and kids) no where to go, no one to really talk to!! This is the change????This is menopause????? You lose yourself and everyone you love???? Thank you for letting me open up and vent. Hopefully I am not alone, although I feel there will be very few if any that would be able to say they have nothing(financially) and no where to go because you all are smart, independent, financially stable women. if I would have known back then that I would end up being like this in menopause I would have set up my future different financially."

Jaceyb,2022-02-26T22:41+00:00,Spotting a month after Hysteroscopy,"Hello! Just joined after reading all the great supportive posts! I have been in menopause for at least 5-6 years now. I started having some brown spotting in Nov. After seeing a GYN she ordered a transvag and pelvic u/s. The u/s said maybe a small fibroid. My lining was too thick at 7mm. I have been on Estrogen patches and progesterone HRT for around 4 years. Had a hysteroscopy and D&C with general anesthesia on Jan 20th. No fibroid, or polyps turned up in the exam. My biopsy results came back ok. No atypical cells. I was relieved. When I went in for my f/u the GYN said low levels of estrogen despite me being on it can cause bleeding. The way she explained it made since and she explained with the estrogen and progesterone it can still happen. Fast forward 5 wks now and I started having brown spotting again. She had told me at the f/u if the spotting occurs again we need to do the whole process all over. Maybe it's still too soon from the hysteroscopy? I am torn to what to do. I thought I could send her a message but then I have a feeling she will say wait and see. Is there something else that could be done to investigate the spotting? I am a nurse, but I am still dumbfounded! Thank you!!"
atx512,2022-02-10T20:58+00:00,Young and possible perimenopause,"Hi Everyone, I'm fairly new to all of this and appreciate any feedback or input. I'm 42 and have talked to my Dr. about perimenopause recently. I was going through a time where i would get hot flashes here and there and have just horrible fatigue and even have alot of restlessness... Then it would be gone like nothing ever happened. I also noticed that i would go through frequent days of being bloated, a very uncomfortable bloating. I'm actually dealing w/ it at the moment and today it probably the first time in about 3 days it's been less annoying. I was on nuva ring for years and i pretty much new my body to the T, where i knew a day or 2 before my period i would get really tired and then i'd have my period for about 3 days, maybe a little spotting on the 4th. They eventually would be a day or 2 tops....and i would start experiencing noticable cramping, which i rarely had. She switched me to lo estren to help keep a hormonal balance, my periods are 1 to 2 days now. I guess some of my questions are: How does BC impact you knowing where you are in perimenopause/menopause? Once I hit menopause will my periods just not come just as if i was not on it? Is anyone taking BS for peri/menopause purposes? Is the only way to really know if you are going through peri/menopause it to be off BC and take a blood test? My aunts and my mom all went through what would be perimenopause in their mid 40's and i think my mom was out of menopause by 52. So i dont doubt i am probably in the same boat... Thank you for sharing any input!"

To give some background, my periods are monthly but it is shorter than heavier than before. I do have fibroids. I just never had this much pain during ovulation.

I have at least 30 other perimenopausal symptoms but this one has floored me. I suffer from M.E/CFS and have always had a very sensitive intolerant stomach especially to meds etc but diet wise always been able to eat well and enjoy all food. Last September had an episode of extreme vomiting and dioreah out of the blue. don't know to this day why? doc said gastroenteritis. this left me with a very bad stomach and took me weeks to be able to tolerate normal food. my tummy always takes weeks to recover when it's been upset by something. Then it happened again in November. violent vomiting and dioreah. which set my stomach back to square one. Then I needed antibiotics this Christmas which was the final straw for my poor tummy. since then, it's been upset 24/7, can't eat any foods except bit of soup or a cracker, it's bloated all the time to varying degrees, very uncomfortable, no appetite, nausea....and basically I've become terrified of food as my stomach hates ANYTHING I eat. in recent weeks belching, gurgling, reflux, constipation and barely eating at all .......which leads me to think it's perimenopausal ? I'm at my wits end. I love my food. it was one of my only joys in life due to being so ill with M.E and bedbound. I'm slim and never been overweight. Now, food is my enemy. I cry every day as I don't know what the hell to do. anything I eat causes so much upset and misery. Doctor unhelpful. just says it's IBS which it possibly is...but I know IBS really ramps up during perimenopause if you're a sufferer which I am, although mildly since I was young. I've had tests. all normal. I'm miserable. unfortunately I cannot tolerate supplements or probiotics etc never have been able to. Worried if I'll ever be able to eat normally again? I haven't eaten a proper meal in so long. if I try I'm in hell. I don't know if it's just because my tummy has had a real battering the last few months and still healing?........or its full on perimenopause causing it all.

jo4848,2017-08-01T13:53+00:00,Spotting - possibly perimenopause but could it be related to exercsise. So scared!,"Hi all, ?This is my first post on here and I'm so glad I found this site. ?I am 45 this week and have recently started experiencing weird symptoms which are scaring me. I am of healthy weight and exercise regularly now (never used to when I was younger). I run 3 times a week and also go to the gym and feel fitter than I've ever been. However, maybe 4 months ago I noticed that my periods would take longer to stop. They are still very regular (every 25 days), painless and quite heavy but for the past few months I'd get brown/sometimes red discharge for another 4-5 days after. Sometimes I'd spot at other times of my cycle too, especially at ovulation. I also think that it is somehow related to streneous exercise or running as it can happen straight after a long run for example. I have done a lot of research and this problem has been reported by many female runners but I still don't think it's normal. I had my overdue smear which came back normal and I saw my GP who immediately suggested I am nearing perimenopause. I had blood tests done which I've just seen online (seeing the same gp in 2 days) and everything seems fine, apart from my TSH (thyroid) being right at the low end of normal. The spotting scares me sooooo much, especially since one of my older running friends just got diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing treatment. ?My periods have always been quite heavy, especially on days 3 and 4 but this month was horrendous and I've been up all night. It then went normal the next few days and stopped properly. I was so happy that it didn't drag on as it had been in the past few months but yesterday I walked around town all day, then went to the gym and today the spotting has returned. It's mainly brown but I can see pink sometimes too.  ?Please tell me if this sounds like peri. I am so scared. I have been getting palputations too, especially in the days before I'm due but think running has really helped with this. ?Looking forward to your replies girls! Click here to view image"

I have been going through this with my husband for quite some time but it keeps escalating and he won’t get counseling. We were on the highway a couple weeks ago and he got angry because we forgot to use these coupons at Home Depot and literally in the middle of the highway he hit the brakes, crossed the lane without even checking, made an illegal U-turn and almost jumped in oncoming traffic. And then he tried to act like he didn’t do anything wrong. He is also a gas lightwe and has some narcissist tendencies. thank God for Pinterest, I found out what narcissism and gaslighting is all about. And it’s making him furious that he’s losing control and that I caught on ti all his BS. I do have to say this may sound contradictory he is a good and kind person but he’s got this serious serious problem and I can’t deal with it any longer. Both of our names are on the house and he doesn’t want to sell, that’s the only thing holding me back from leaving. I'm scared ...sad confused ...and feel very lonely and isolated. going through menopause has made it much more difficult.

I seem to be at my 'best' (I use the term very lightly ) during days 1-12. I'm not sure I'm ovulating every month as can I usually tell but periods are still regular. What would this mean in terms of hormones? Am I best when both estrogen and progesterone are lowest or is this not the case if I'm not ovulating? I'm trying to work out if I need estrogen or it it's causing the problems. Anyone noticed the same thing? Thank you x"

Sue1996,2022-02-03T01:32+00:00,Over 60 and still in peri?,"Is anyone else over 60 and still dealing with perimenopause? I thought I was done 2 or 3 times since my late 50's only to have a random period just as I was about to hit the 1 year mark. Other times I'd have only spotting occasionally. The past 3 years I've gone for months with nothing then suddenly have what I assume is a period. Except I don't get the horrible cramps like I did when I was young, just a mild cramp or none at all. I save all of my old calendars and I used to only mark when my period started, but since it's gotten so weird I've been marking the color of any spotting or discharge and how long it lasts so I can really keep track. Sometimes I have random spotting, sometimes a pink or light brown discharge. Sometimes a full blown period but they haven't been that bad until recently. I had one that lasted about 7 or 8 days and sort of heavy, then nothing for 2 months, no spotting or anything. Then I had spotting that was bad enough I thought I was starting another period, then it stopped for a few days then I had a period from hell, super heavy, lots of clots. Ran out of super plus tampons (which they discontinued so I have trouble finding the only ones that ever worked for me). So I had to use the super ones and I had to change them every 3 hours or so. Then it seemed like it was slowing down, then I had a massive flooding episode that lasted all night, a few times I'd put a super tampon in and by the time I got back to bed it was leaking through. Then in the morning that stopped, so I just stayed laying down the next two days, afraid to get up and move around for fear it would start again. I have no insurance and the roads were bad and the hospital ER is overrun with covid patients, did not feel like sitting there for hours like that. Then it slowed down for 2 days to almost nothing. But then I changed the tampon and it didn't have much on it, thought it was about over and put a new one in and blood was running down my hand. That made no sense since the one I just took out was only half covered. So I took that one back out and the bleeding was bad then all of the sudden (sorry too much info) a big glob came out. I thought my insides were falling out, totally freaked me out so bad. But after that it totally stopped. So I don't know what is going on but I had nothing after that which was almost 2 weeks, then started having pink discharge again. Which I've had in the past but after the last period it freaked me out. Then tonight the pad had blood on it when I went up to the bathroom. So I don't know if that's just spotting again or if the whole mess is starting again. When I was young I had super bad cramps and pms but I was very regular, every 28-30 days never sooner and never later than that. Like clockwork, but now it's all over the place, sometimes months and months with nothing, other times spotting all month, it's all so random and never the same. I really thought I was done with this several times. Then it starts up again and I totally freak out. I know there's a thread here with women over 65, but it's several years old so I thought I'd ask again to see if anyone else is over 60 and still going through this. I'm 63, some of my friends think something is horribly wrong since they all stopped with no problems in their 50's."

I have been keeping a record of my periods since October 2020 and the longest I have gone without a period is 2-3 months, now this last bleed started last Tuesday and was a brownish red colour to begin with then normal reddish pink but showing no signs of stopping even after 8 days has anyone else experienced bleeding for longer than 7 days, I had bad cramps for about 5 days before this last bleed started which is unusual for me as when I normally get the cramps it’s when my bleeding starts not several days beforehand.

jo96903,2022-01-31T21:12+00:00,Circulation issues is it Peri or something else?,I started HRT Evorel Sequi 3 months ago and the estrogen patch has been fine but when i switch to the progesterone i don't feel as good. The second month was better than the first but this third month has been the worst. my period has come after 24 days and the day prior to it arriving I felt exhausted and really sick but the most worrying is a change in my circulation. My feet have always had a bit of Reynaulds but on the day before my period my left hand went redder than my right and it has stayed like that. I saw my GP on Thursday an he checked for clots and my heart and said he thought that was all ok but has taken bloods for connective tissue disease although he thinks they will come back fine. He is also rechecking my thyroid as I have borderline underactive thyroid which they are not treating yet. My health anxiety has been really good for ages but this has really stressed me out and I'm imagining allsorts! Although ive only posted a couple of times on the forum seeing others stories has always given me such comfort so i thought i would ask if anyone has suffered anything similar to give me some reassurance.

It is OK, I got rid of many health issues like migraines, fatigues, etc. that plagued me for years. I am generally healthy, even though there are some problems like tinnitus worsening, eye floaters, gums and teeth that are bothering me. But I do not like my physical appearance now. During past months I turned into an ""grandma"". I got some weight (more or less OK, not too much), and my body changed - large breasts and belly. There is something ""old-ladyish"" in me that I do not like. Clothes that I loved wearing before do not suit me now. I lost my style completely (jeans, shirts, sneakers). Unknown people in shops, public transport behave like I am somebody ""old"" and probably pity. My face changed. I have never been a sexy type, but I was pretty, a bit Audrey Hepburn type. Now it is simply gone. However, what is funny that I FEEL mentally younger that ten years ago. But in an ""old"" body. Does somebody has the same experience?"

She did a trans vaginal ultrasound which didn’t show anything suspicious. but a fibroid that I’ve had for many many years. She told me the uterine lining is very thin so there isn’t any concerns. I followed up in 6 weeks. There was no bleeding and ultrasound did not change. She told me not to worry and she would see me again in 1 year for my annual checkup.

It disrupts my sleep, and I've had this for a long time now. I've got myself worried I have ovarian cancer. I made an appt with my Gyno for next week to have bloodwork done to hopefully rule this out. All these things I have can be symptoms of this cancer. Anyone else with these symptoms? Thank you."

Im 40 (41 in may) and have been having a whole lot of weird things happening this past year and longer. Symptoms include: Periods all off schedule, Tired all the time, Hairs under chin, Heart palpitations, Dizziness, Depression, Anxiety, Nails slow growing, Nail ridges, very Low libido, Ringing in ears, Skin crawling, Itchy skin /bruising after scratching, severe joint pain, shoulder/arm pain, left breast pain, sensitive nipples, tender spots all over body, sensitive teeth, sore feet/plantar fact. The most recent symptom has me thrown for a loop and its making me think I have something more serious going on. Last month (before christmas) I noticed some small bruising behind my upper arm. It startled me, cause i couldnt figure out how they got there. They eventually faded out, but yesterday i noticed another small purple bruise near the same spot as before, and this morning there is another. i know this time They are just appearing for no reason. I made an appointment with my Dr. to get some bloodwork done but I've convinced myself that this isnt good and it has driven me down a big scary rabbit hole!!! Spent yesterday in bed just in a complete state of worry, and after seeing the new spot this morning, I know today will be the same. I've been scouring this group looking for someone who has had the same type thing happen with the bruising, but no luck. So i really hope and pray someone can comment here and settle my nerves. I have HUGE health anxiety, especially over the bad stuff (I cant even say the word), so you can only imagine the thoughts going through my head. I should add that I am 5 days away from my period start. I've wrecked my brain trying to remember if the previous bruises happened around the same time last month. This is all so much, and the majority of all my symptoms have only happened within the last few months. I just feel like I'm never going to be happy again. I feel like Im living out my final days. I have everything in the world to be happy about, great marriage (minus the lack of intimacy) 2 beautiful happy healthy kids, so why am I feeling like this?? Why me??"

Ive also spoken a little about weight loss but wanted to post this to specifically address and ask those who struggle with weight loss during this time? My appetite has been really poor for this time period ive been in Meno. 1 yr. Mainly i notice that i try to eat/push foods/ and do not gain. for those who have the other problem with weight gain.  be thankful! The weight loss is scary, and upsetting when you are used to being a healthy normal weight. I would trade over weight vs under any day. Ive also been dealing with thirst, and its like im not quenching thirst, but have a dry mouth. Mornings are dreadful with huge exhaustion..only a reprieve later in the evening when i feel calmer and safe. Although my thyroid labs come back normal..im tempted to think that it could be combined with a thyroid issue. It seems like thyroid and Meno share similarities in the symptoms.. Anxiety/depression and this weight/nausea/stomach issue have been the biggest factors impairing my ability to function. I also know that the gut is tied to the mind, so perhaps this is the problem... I would love to hear back on your issues pertaining to weight loss, your stories your thoughts. Thank you and thanks for this forum.. xooxox"

Elmtree57,2022-01-08T23:08+00:00,A light has gone on!,"Hi ladies. Happy New Year to you all! I've just signed in here after taking a break because I was overloaded with information. BUT, today I decided to sign back in. I am also following the Anxiety posts along with this one. It's funny how both subjects are quite similar. Many on here tell their stories about how they are anxious, losing weight, not sleeping, nauseated, tingling in arms and legs, breathing is off, and much more. I was wondering if maybe it's not menopause and could be an anxiety disorder? I say this because I've been experiencing all these sypmtoms and have been told by doctors that it's anxiety. I don't think it is. I've asked countless times (to many diff specialists) if it could be post menopause (I'm 64) and all of them do not want to go down that road. I've asked if I should have a hormone blood workup done and they will not do it. After reading several of the posts here it makes me feel a bit better knowing I am not alone. Right now I am currently on anti depressants (day 3) because they think its anxiety. I have held out taking them for months and felt I should try even though I despise meds. So far? Day 3 is brutal with side effects. So, if your doctor suggests that you have anxiety, really look deep into trying to see if it is that or menopause. The only thing is, they don't really know much about menopause and go down the anxiety rabbit hole instead. That's my opinion anyway. I could be all wet and sound like I'm in anxiety denial but I really feel everything happening to me is totally hormonal, not all in my head. I hope someone out there can relate to this and may have another outlook on this and maybe some advice, Who knows. Thanks for reading my rant."

My left eye feels weird and different to the right eye. I've noticed that when this happens I get really really anxious and I can't work out if the anxiety is causing the pressure/sensations or if I'm anxious because of it. Weirdly when this happens an artery in my forehead pops out, which is freaking me out and making my health anxiety go through the roof. I've told my Dr about it every time I go and they can't give me any explanation. I had a head MRI in Oct and an eye scan at the opticians recently and nothing was found but I'm now worrying they've missed something. Has anyone had anything similar to this? Thank you xxxx"

In the last six months or so, I have had increasing issues with constipation. I can go seven days without being able to go. I eat lots of fiber, drink lots of water, and exercise daily. I'm convinced that it is hormone-related, as when estrogen drops, cortisol increases, which can lead to digestive issues, as can low progesterone. I have resorted to twice weekly laxative suppositories, which work brilliantly, but I am concerned about using them for months on end. I'd like to hear from other women experiencing something similar. What have you been taking / doing? Does this symptom improve post-menopause? Any insights would be greatly appreciated!"

Age 64. Been through the peri-menopause and now post for 3 years. Will list all the peri symptoms in future. Tried all the natural stuff; progesteron, soy, black cohosh, chastbberry/vitex, maca... All caused awful side effects, including migraine headache, lights in eyes, thyroid disruption, weak fatigue, trouble thinking, reading, vertigo... All gone after months no herbs, hormone creams... Main problem now is joints in feet. 3 injuries may have contributed to pain in top right foot, a bump, stiff ripping arches, other problems. Traveling into left foot but not as bad, suspect left foot strained compensating for right. and long walks, heavy lifting 4 years moving 3 times, 53, 17 stairs. Losing weight and a elevator in new home has helped. But 5-10 pounds gain, fat on abdomen brings back to pain, stiff feet. Take raw apple cider vinegar, diluted so as not to burn stomach. The scary part; foot, toe kept getting 'stuck' stiff-immobile suddenly when walking. Happens when overweight and right at the beginning of a hotflash sneaking up on me! I fell walking and dark black, blue knees for 2 weeks. Since then I am afraid to walk without a small shopping buggy to hold onto in case the foot does this. Hoping this is menopause and will cure itself. Foot doc says is arthritis. Almost 100% healed when lost 20 pounds. Trying again. Buying a chair for work. The hotflashes increase any joint pain, old injuries, even sinus, burning, itching, dry eyes living at airport... HJaw, ear muscle tension, neck... Any health problem is increased and muscles tighten, pull when a hotflash begins. Problem goes 90% -100% after the hotflash has broken through. Losing weight also helps prevent all this pain, stiffness during hotflash. Any advice? I truly sympathize with the ladies on here; its ROUGH!!"

I started on it in Sept and then experienced the worse anxiety of my life. Literally felt like I was in panic mode 24/7 (this was just on the estrogel, I didn't get to try the utrogestan). I kept going for a couple of weeks hoping it would improve but in the end I stopped as I couldn't stand it anymore. Anyway my GP says that estrogel wouldn't cause anxiety. I did feel a little better after stopping but not sure if that was a placebo. I then got covid and all the symptoms got really bad again and have stayed that way. My GP suggested i give HRT another go and I try the evorel patch as it might be better for me. When I tried it again my anxiety ramped up and I took the patch off after 2 days. Has anyone experienced this with estrogen making them anxious? I'm 46 and peri.

I'm taking sertraline (week 7) but doesnt seem to be helping much yet - im praying its early days. I would say im perimenopausal, periods getting shorter, hot flushes and deep depression (suicidal) leading up to and during period. My mum and her mum died of ovarian cancer so Gp has said HRT is out the question. In my desperation to get better I contacted a private hormone clinic. Using all my savings I paid £400 for a consultation, £300 for hormone blood test and a further £120 for some bioidentical progestorone cream and DHEA (oestrogen alternative) suppliments. The psychiatrist said they were going to be made up bespoke to match my blood results. After the products arrived this week i noticed there were no ingredients, information or warnings on the packaging. Ive since been told that its impossible to get an accurate hormone blood test due to fluctuations, the NHS website says that there is no evidence that this kind of unregulated medicine works. Another Dr has written about how this is all a big money making racket taking advantage of women suffering during their menopause/perimenopause. Has anyone used similar products and had results or is it a big scam and Ive been robbed? considering my current mental health this was the last thing I needed whilst trying to find hope."

I had the physical symptoms as well, but the mental and emotional symptoms scared he living daylights out of me. I have always had issues with depression, anxiety and PTSD, and when perimenopause hit, my old meds stopped working. It was like my entire body changed and I was left frantically trying to figure out what to do with this new me. I tried herbal remedies, essential oils, herbs and bio-identical hormone therapy. The bio-identical treatment helped a little bit with the physical symptoms, but mentally, I was still a complete mess. I finally stopped the BHRT and tried Prempro. So far, the Prempro is helping. My question is this: has anyone else developed weird/scary intrusive thoughts? Like mental hospital thoughts? My dr was very understanding and told me that she's seen menopausal women come in who are literally psychotic, but I still can't help feeling that there must be something really wrong with me. I've made an appt with a behavioral health therapist, so I am hoping this helps. I am so glad that this forum is available. I would appreciate your honest thoughts and opinions! Much love to you all."

joan92570,2018-03-17T14:01+00:00,I to suffer from Burning Mouth Sydrome,"Hi, my name is Joan and I to suffer from BMS.  First of all for the first time I feel like I am not alone in this.  I have been to many doctors and they just do not understand and keep trying different medications and of course nothing worked.  I stopped going to see the doctors because they really don't know. Not one suggected that it could be postmenopause. I have been suffering now for about 5 years now, its so hard to remember because it creeps up without you without really realizing it.  I though it was part of my acid reflex.  The best thing to do is your own research.  When I found this sight everything made so much more sence to me.  I'm not alone anymore.  That makes such a difference for me, that I'm not crazy. BMS excists.  Thank you all for sharing your BMS, hopefully we can get more people to join our conversation and help one another. Mornings don't feel as bad as the rest of the day.  It starts burning in the afternoon and just gets worse from there.  Some early evenings it gets so bad that I will take a sleeping pill and just go to bed. Not sure why they say alcohol dosn't help because sometimes a glass or two of wine I feel it can calm me down a bit.  Maybe stress has a little part of it aswell or it just takes my mind of the pain.  Anyway, hope to hear from someone and share our stories and not feel alone."

I'm 46 and have been struggling with perimenopause symptoms for about a year. Over the past 3 months it's intensified to the point where I am constantly in a state of fight or flight and my heart rate is above 100 most of the time. It's just spiked to 150 just walking up the stairs. I've gone from running 5k everyday to not being able to walk around without feeling out of breath. I've just had a heart monitor and awaiting the results. EKG showed fast heart rate but normal rhythm.I literally feel like there must be something seriously wrong with me to feel like this constantly. MY Dr gave me HRT (estrogel and utrogestan) to try (which I did for 2 months) but it didn't help at all and I've stopped it to see if it was making me worse. The palpitations/fast heart rate are just awful. I can't even seem to calm myself down or relax. Just feel wired!! Please any advice would be greatfully received.

I slept ok for a few hours, but woke up in a panic way before dawn... that swirling, feel like your falling panic and doom and dread. Got up feeling like my arms and legs are made of lead. Aches in every joint... neck, shoulders, elbows, hips, back, knees, toes... even my ribs hurt. Gagging if I move to fast. Brain fog. Peeing every 15 minutes, constant pressure down below. Every bit of my body is so dry it feels hideous, except my face and my scalp which are the oiliest they've ever been. Had to fight hard to do the morning routine successfully,... no energy.... and was so tense when I dropped off my daughter at school that I cried after she walked in the bldg. Tried to cheer myself up with a iced mocha... took one drink and spit it out... stomach started churning immediately. Sat down to work (our office is still work from home), and was so tense I was shaking. So I told my boss I have to step away for a bit. I have been fighting migraines for a week straight, and all the symptoms that come with those before, during and after. I just have nothing left to give, and don't know what to do to fill my tank again until I can see the gyne on the 28th and beg to test my hormone balance and hopefully up my dose of hrt. Sorry for the rant. Please pray for me if you get a moment. Thank you lovelies! Sara"

For years now I've been tracking my period using a phone app. For about 6 months now (maybe even longer when I think back) I've been getting severe cramping for a day or two about a week after my period. I started checking the app and every time I feel this way it's during ovulation. I'm starting to wonder if this is hormone related. At first I thought it was horrible heart burn and stomach cramps. I even went to the gastro doctor and had an endoscopy, which came back normal. I'm 45, and other than my periods lasting a few days longer than normal and being more anxious, I haven't experienced any other perimenopausal symptoms I read about online. Is anyone else going through this? Thanks! Jenn"

jasmyn37161,2021-11-06T03:30+00:00,"I just found this site and I think it might be peri, maybe I'm not dying after all!","So this will be longish, sorry in advance! I had a partial hysterectomy at 32 I'm 39 now fast forward to 5 months ago, I had this weird tingling sensation on my scalp, that progressed to basically what I would describe as the sensation of sunburn you would receive after falling asleep on the beach at lava lake, château hedes. I went to the Dr, who says its probebly a virus it will subside on its own, well a week goes by with this infernal burning, I'm walking around with ice packs on my scalp because its the only thing that sort of helps and I figure I might as well look as ridiculous as I feel. The burning persists for about 2 weeks, then stops, I'm good for about three days and then the same burn takes up residence on my neck , and right armpit. 0 out of 5 stars , I do not recommend. lasts about 2 weeks and stops. Im thinking that its just whatever virus thing moving around and through my system but its stopped, so I can go back to my regularly scheduled programming. But wait! theirs more because within a few days my right breast feels swollen heavy and is so gosh awful sore, I can't bare to touch it, wear a bra or sleep, so I trade my ice packs for heating pads and become a potato, moving is too painful. Now naturally I panic , its got to be breast cancer because boobs! but calmer heads prevailed and I think ok, maybe its hormonal? I have no idea where I'm at in my cycle because I have been bun oven free for like 8 years, I resign to give it a few weeks and top up on advil (which I might add provides zero relief) 3 weeks later and my boob feels less heavy and isn't murderously sore its just tender and sore on the outer edge. Then what I can only describe as horror feels like someone has pinched my nipple, from the inside, yup the inside! How is that even a thing? So forget not panicking im full out Dr. Googling. Yup definitely breast cancer and I'm feeling around after reading about lumps and I find a dang lump an inch long on the outer edge. Now I read that you should look for skin changes but heres the thing, my lovely double Ee's after some weight loss the year before (at least thats what I thought caused it ) are now stretch mark cladded, shriveled balloons, they look like I left them in the wash too long how the heck am I supposed to know if my skin is dimpled? scratch that this has got to be dimpling, I have breast cancer and its a month long wait for me to get a mammogram. Sigh, so because crippling fear of breast cancer isn't bad enough my ribs under my breast also begin to hurt it starts right below my nipple . Every day it spreads further, and further until my whole rib on the right side wrapping all the way around my back has a deep intense ache. So like any sane person I came to the logical conclusion, I most definitely have breast cancer which has mestasticed to my bones. But wait! there's more! my armpit has now also begun to hurt it feels like the skin is ... pinch-y , achey and generally unpleasant... so the cancer is most definitely in my boob my bone and my lymph nodes. I call my Dr who manages to get me an earlier appointment because I'm freaking out, oddly enough my boob also has the occasional sensation of your milk letting down so definitely cancer! well the pain continues , nothing improves its the night before my mammogram, I struggle to fall asleep , my stupid leg is doing its freakish random muscle twitch and I'm generally uncomfortable, I stick my feet out of the covers because for the last few years I get to warm otherwise, but not really because I'm cold but my feet are apparently on their own thermostat. I finally fall asleep an then out of the blue BAM! I fall right out of bed, because I have been shot! that's really the only way to describe it, as if the right sided weirdness needed any help! Just below my nipple at the edge of my rib feels like a bullet has passed through... I crawl my way to the hall roll around like a dying fish for awhile debating on whether to uber or ambulance, I err on the side of caution because its 3 am and I dont want an uber driver thinking I'm in labour because I'm sweating, moaning and fairly sure this is how I end .... hospital runs tests, CT of chest in case its an embolism, clear. blood work clear, and basically shake their heads ... so I've now spent 16 hrs at the hospital my flank feels like I have been crushed in a vice, I'm also nauseated, my armpits are soaked, and smell like hot garbage. Im wearing my flannel pants and my little Unicorn tee-shirt because fashion sense didn't seem like a priority 16 hrs earlier when I was being scooped off the floor. I uber home, crawl into bed and all I got for my adventure was a healthy dose of radiation, and a bunch of pinholes in my arms, worst bit... Missed my mammogram ! call the next day for a new appointment. another 2 week wait. So now on top of my chest pain and breast pain, I can add upper right quadrant pain to the list. the sharp pain goes away but the whole area feels tender. thankfully the rib pain starts to subside over the next few days leaving only the breast pain and weird achy armpits that continue to sweat profusely and stink. Finally a win I think... but alas it was the advent of painful guts, every time I eat about 15 mins later, I get hot , nauseous and dry heave because my body apparently thinks this is a good time... over the next week I can add constipation to the list of maladays . I eat enough prunes to put down a horse, try a bunch of things that should work , but hey, I've never had to deal with constipation because my whole life has been centered around the opposite problem. I own shares in immodium by now. So basically I'm falling apart, there is nothing that doesn't seem to hurt, as one thing improves another thing starts. Just went pee, go again... (no uti) Have some itchy public hair to go with that ice pick in the vagina pain that occurs at random and terribly inconvenience times because today your armpit isn't as achy! Finally fell asleep? ... please let us provide you with saturating boob and neck sweat while you perform the dance of I cant believe I have a Charlie horse in my foot at 2 am. Wake up, feel ok? today is the gift of shoulder blade pain, and heartburn that feels like a hole is being burnt in the pit of my stomach. Oh and today? that maddening burning sensation has returned , all over my face , constant sunburn, but my boobs aren't sore so I guess thats a win. But the absolute worst part, laying awake convinced Im am dying and the dr is missing something, the actual intense heart racing heavy impending fear of doom, I get it during the day too but not like I do at night. I'm suddenly getting teary over opening a can of tuna and pampers commercials , my dr who is wonderful I think is developing ptsd from fear I will call ...again and my night stand could provide pharma care to a small country. I haven't been diagnosed as peri but after finding this page Monday my poor gp is getting a phone call for more labs. I really was thinking that I've gone utterly off my rocker, I even made my will because the last few months have been atrocious .So I am just wanting to say thank you all for sharing your stories, because while ill likely have terrible insomnia, and boob sweats to go with my new found Gerd tonight, I have hope that maybe I'm not dying and this is just peri and not a death sentence. oh and my mammogram, yup clear!"

You go to work, do some shopping, exercise, go to class, relax, chat on a couple of forums, run to the office, take the kids to school, pick up a prescription or two, check on your elderly parents, run some important errands, pay some bills, etc.. Those are just a few of the things, many of us women do on a day-to-day basis. Having said that, ALL of a sudden, from out of nowhere, your body feels faint, your knees get weak, your ENERGY has left your body; you are extremely TIRED!! Wherever you are, you think about how fast can you get to your bed to be in it and absorb it! When you finally get in that nice, comfy, 800-thread sheet count, well-dressed bed, you PULL THE COVERS OVAA your head and hope no one in the house says anything to you! You are trying to rest and get some form of energy back, so that you can function the next day. You don't want ANYONE to say Sugar, Honey, Ice Tea, to you!

It all started December last year for me when i went 5 months without a period, to all of a sudden one day , heart started racing, thought i was having a heart attack and ended up calling the ambulance. Chest/lung xrays all clear, bloods all clear and its basically gone down hill from there. Periods are back although all over the place The digestive issues, insomnia, dry skin, constipation, brain fog, anxiety attacks and for me the worst has been the shoulder/neck daily aches and pains. I feel like i have aged about 50 years in 6 months. Feel like i am running back to the doctor every month with something new and she must think im crazy. Have had full bloods done nearly every 3 months and they always come back clear I am very funny about taking any sort of medication and at worst will take a panadol. After my last visit with Dr which was about the waking up with tingling arms/hands and daily tinnitus i have finally decided to give the Estradot patches a try. I really cant take feeling like this anymore and am at my wits end. I was just wondering if any of you ladies out there have had any experience with Estradot patches and if there were any negative/positives. I am on Estradot 25 and Provera 10mg. It has only been 3 days and apparently it takes a few weeks to kick into gear so i will keep you all posted to see if i find any relief."

I have upped my dose of chelated magnesium to 450 mg. I have had no caffeine. I don't know why. My bp is fine. I take bp meds and have for years so I check my bp daily. My pulse is good as is my Blood O2. Just this skipping. Just when I think they are gone, I get a bout of skips. I am not stress out. I am not bringing them on by worry. I have had episodes of this in the past. Chelated magnesium was a godsend. But now it isn't helping. I have a standing follow up appt with my NP next Wed. She is going to ask me if I have seen a cardiologist. No I haven't I had one in my old city, but not here. I had an ultrasound done on all my major organs including my heart. All looks good other than a cyst on my left kidney. I am getting arthritis really bad in my left hand (I am left handed) and in my right knee. I started taking glucosamine with msn about a week ago it seems to have helped my knee. Postmenopause I feel is worse than perimenopause. At least for me. Peri was hell, post is nighmarish hell.

No period since May and overall, I was feeling pretty good. Then last week, I started spotting on Tuesday, true flow by Thursday, and I am still bleeding. It's not really heavy - just lasting forever (I guess that's not surprising). But with it came back a bunch of my awful symptoms, the worst being the reflux and heart palpitations. Mornings are the worst, with so much gunk in my throat, I cough so much I gag. Things get better as the day goes on and luckily I am sleeping okay, but once I get up, it's awful.

Along with all the other horrible peri-menopause symptoms i am experiencing at the moment i have had a few episodes which i am not sure how to explain. It starts off with a funny feeling in my stomach which moves to my chest then all of a sudden my heart starts racing and i have palpitations. They last 5/10 minutes and afterwards i feel shaky and have shivers, although i do not sweat during them. I have had so many blood tests, heart/chest xrays/worn a heart monitor - everything comes back fine. It is so scary and at the time i think i am having a heart attack. Just wondering if any of you ladies have had any similar experiences I am in peri - went 5 months with no period and for the last 5 months have had periods all over the place. My main other symptoms that are driving me crazy are insomnia, shoulder/neck pain, tingling hands when waking, digestive issues. Its the episodes where my heart starts racing that scares me the most, where i am at the point of wanting to go down to the ER and all of a sudden the start to subside"

I've only had to stop using it because I'll be turning 60 soon and the risks increase for me after that age. But I miss it! I'm experiencing hot flushes here and there again. And my vaginal pain has returned 😞 - even while still using Pregabalin for it! Don't know if it's even worth taking that anymore 😔.

I have been spotting since February, have had 3 ultrasounds and 1 hysteraonogram (the one with saline), 2 endometrial biopsies. The endometrial biopsies came back normal, and 2 ultrasounds found this region they don't know if its a fibroid or polyp. All the doctors say not to worry about cancer but for some reason it's stuck in my mind. My spotting happens mid-cycle, from mid-cycle all the way to my period. I have also started a week before my period, had a period for 7 days then spotted again for a few days. Sometimes spotting is brown, sometimes pink, sometimes its just this little spot or fleck of dried blood. Can someone please confirm this is normal so I can stop panicking? I am driving myself crazy - likely partly because of the anxiety that goes with all this. Good thoughts and experiences would be much appreciated. Hope everyone is well!"

I've gotten this sensation over the years usually after I've eaten something fried, heavy , or eaten fast. It feels like a thickening/lump in my throat and there is pain, Usually it passes in a minute or so, sometimes it helps if I drink something. A few weeks ago, for the first time it felt like a burp was trapped in my throat. I tried to burp and made a noise but the sensation of constriction remained the same. I could talk fine. This happened just after I had eaten a handful of grapes quickly. Then last night, it happened again. Same feeling like a thickening, pain, trapped burp. Drinking didn't help and I was panicking. I tried to burp and on the second or third attempt I regurgitated liquid. It was water i had just drunk and saliva. It wasn't thrown up but regurgitated. I had taken a bunch of vitamins (quickly) but the feeling didn't happen right away. I read a couple of pages of my book, took a few sips of tea, ate a few pieces of popcorn and that's when I got the feeling. I dread it happening again and feel like I am going to die.

I hit the 2 year mark last month and guess what happened? I got a bleed which scared the daylight out of me. Can you believed it happened around the same time i would have had my period. You know you've heard the saying once you hit menopause after 12 months should be no bleed. Here's my story: I was drinking this detox /hormone imbalance herbal tea and i would notice each time i drank it i got a bit pms like a period wanted to come back. So because of this i stopped the tea. I decided to try again last month and i drank one cup before my morning walk thinking while sweating it would definitely bring the toxins out, I return from my walk and drank another cup and maybe a cup throughout the day. I also drink lots of green tea througout the day ( but no longer). Moving forward- next morning my morning pee i wiped and it was pinkish . I thought maybe it was just dryness because i do suffer with that along with vaginal atrophy. I drank more tea this day as well. The next morning pee i wiped and red not pinkish, ohh sh-- my heart started racing and thumping so hard! I was screaming Oh Lord! Yall, the peri/menopause really brought anxiety and health anxiety on me. I was never this way until this change of life approached me. Before the day was over it was like a full period, i started out with liners but had to use the pads before the day was over . The more i drank the more it flowed, so i stopped the tea and eventually it stopped after 4 days. I made an appointment with my GYN but she couldn't get me until 2 wks away. Too long , with my health anxiety. I made another appointment with my primary dr and was able to get appointment in 2 days. A pap smear was done which came back bacterial vaginosis, ( which i'm constantly seem to deal with since menopause) transvaginal ultrasound was done which show endometrial lining 4mm, but calcification along lining 5mm ( i think this is what freaked me out the most because ive never heard of it and cant seem to find much info on it) . A biopsy was order but i told my primary dr that I prefer to have it done with my regular gyn. Dont know if that was a mistake or what . It took 3 weeks to get the results, was told it would be 7-10 days.. But my GYN was very concerned and wanted to know the whole detail of what happened. She did say that the tea could have had an estrogenic effect. I just a got call from them today, I was too freaky nervous with anxietyto even call. I had to schedule a telemed with her for next week. So more anxiety just waiting. Anyone else ever had a post menopause bleeding ? Biopsy? calcification? any of these? Oh, I did contact the company i got the tea from and was told that this wasn't anything new to them. It has happened to other women as well in menopause. I did feel an effect while taking it, my libido changed, energy, calmer, an overall wellness feel. Now, since all of this what was no symptoms seem to return . I'm hoping and praying it was only tea .Sorry this post is so long but thank you for reading it."

I am so scared to take anything now. It came to me this morning ( I do have clear thinking once in awhile). That every time i had a feeling of joy or happiness I felt 100 times worse right after. It has led me to the conclusion that its the increase in Seratonin that is making me feel worse. This is totally counter intuitive because we are always trying to make our selves feel better. But I now believe that is part of the problem. If you also found SSRIs made your symptoms worse maybe try an anti anxiety med that does not increase your seratonin. I am willing to take the chance."

It's almost like a ""lump"" in your throat, but yet...not. Somewhat like somethings caught in there, but yet you can still swallow, eat, etc. Sometimes I think it's just another anxiety attack because it comes along with a ""tightening"" under the chin sort of? But not all the time. Obviously anxiety comes with it because any of these weird feelings cause ME anxiety, which only makes the symptoms worse. Sometimes I get a random pain behind one of my ears with it. The little random bursts of pain, and in joints, or anywhere really, are so annoying.  I'm not on any meds other than trying to stay diligent in taking vitamins, chelated magnesium, B12, C, Humic Minerals, a probiotic when I have one. Haven't gotten any Vit. D yet but I probably need it. I also don't add any iron and probably need that too who knows.  Grrrr...just so tired of one day being great, next day awful. A week of good, two weeks of horrid.  4 months ago when all this started I literally thought I was dying. Went to urgent care at midnight. Nothing wrong, some fluid behind my ears she said was causing vertigo. (dizziness was BAD at that time) Got better after learning that, wasn't as ""anxious"" but still have bouts of minor dizziness, not full blown vertigo again though. Some naseau with it, but not too bad.  Allergies are much worse now too, so I take a Claritin D every day to help.  I wonder sometimes if a bunch of these other things are really the increased allergy issue. I'm never stuffy, but it seems like a sinus headache when it comes on, and head feels heavy, I get tired, just not near as much energy as before.  Sucks. :-("

I'd been dealing with horrible morning sickness like symptoms for months now. I just referred to it as nausea. My daughter, who just had a baby said ""mom, that sounds like morning sickness"". And she was dead right!  I'll just cut to the chase. After some research I found this page: https://suite.io/deanna-lynn-sletten/2zxy21w   Needless to say, I have been nausea free for two weeks now. (I wanted to make sure it was really working before I posted) I recently (a few months back)  started drinking coffee in the morning only as a cure for constipation. (I hate coffee) I was also only eating some almonds for breakfast and three meals a day. Well, the writer of this blog has a few tips on what to change in your daily life to help you get through this phase. I stopped the coffee and drink Ginger/Honey tea,I  eat a banana for breakfast and smaller meals throughout the day. Most the writers other advice I already do. Day one of my change... zero nausea. And everyday since for two weeks now. I'm still slightly dizzy, just slightly. But the most horrible side of it is gone. I hope this helps a lot of you too.  Click here to view image"

Long story short, went to dr last Thursday, he always maintains that my dizziness/off balance problem is due to anxiety. I told the dr I have been speaking to others on this forum who have similar symptoms and problems with their balance and it has to be recognised as part of meno After a good chat with the GP, he read through my blood tests which were done in July this year, he said that my estrogen was so low that he would consider me now menopausal, estrogen was less than 70 (what ever that means) fsh 76. Anyway, he said that the menopause sometimes causes some woman to develope benign positional vertigo and that it should settle with time. He said normally by the age of 55 things would be better....I'm only 51, will be 52 in Feb 🙉🙈 don't think I could suffer this for a long period Dr had taken more bloods as I asked for progesterone to be checked as well as estrogen I've made another appointment to discuss the results but another dr told me briefly over the phone that the estrogen and progesterone have both came back low even though I've been taking livial HRT for 3 months I went on the internet last night browsing looking at hormone levels and was redirected to another website as I typed in dizziness and OMG I've been in such a state since I'm wondering if any of you ladies can help if you Google MdDS, it's a balance condition and please tell me that my balance problems will be hormone related I'm staggering around today balance terrible and feel woozy just unbalanced I'd be grateful for any help or reassurance Thanks xx"

Since January I have felt more and more exhausted (even having to drop a days work to a four day week, and drop a days pay!!!) The aches and pains in my joints (particularly my knees and shoulders) have got worse, excruciating pain in my thighs and hips and I presume because of the constant pain I have become very depressed. Also swelling and pain in every joint in my fingers. My doctor has done all my bloods (normal) and then sent me to a rhuematologist who dignosed fybromyalgia. Life was hard and infact at times I thought I would be better off dead :-( Well...to get to my point approx a week ago on a Friday I realised I had run out of my Tibilone, I was a little worried but there was nothing I could do, I just had to wait until Monday to even put a script in at the Docs. By Sunday I realised the pain in my thighs and knees had eased a lot! by Monday my mood was so much better, I actually felt happy for the first time in months! I tried to think what was different? why has there been this change in my symptoms...I was looking at what Id eaten or not eaten then it dawned on me TIBOLONE!!!! I googled and got this sight and thank GOD I did. since I stopped this horror pill that Friday I have got better and better and feel I have a life again. I dont think I have Fybromyalgia I feel the side effects of Tibolone mimic the symptoms of Fybro. I know this HRT has worked for some but there are an awful lot on here that have had similar dreadful side effects so please anyone that is considering taking it just be mindful of how dibilitating the side effects can be. My hot flushes and insomnia were NOTHING compared to what I have been through..I will put up with them standing on my head than take any more HRT that could cause this again."

I had a postmenopausal bleed end of July, - I am 56 and finished my periods end 2019. I phoned my GP and got on to the 2 week pathway and was seen 2nd August for an transvaginal ultrasound. I have a 3cm cyst Dermoid Cyst, which i have since been told its benign together with a CA125 blood test - Since early July I have been waking up 3 time a night on average with stomach cramps, diarrhoea (thin stools) since then off and on, lower back pain, stomach gurgling. Went to UTS at my local hospital and was told (as i thought i might have) i have a prolapse, (rectocele) I also have haemorrhoids. I have read and feel the stomach cramps and diarrhoea is potentially connected to the 7 cm Fibroid that i have or hormonal activity that is affecting my bowel. I have contacted my GP but like everything at the mo, they wont see you face to face but only by Telephone consultation. I have as of Monday this week had another postmeno bleed. I have had awful stomach cramps and what feels like constipation, feel like there is an obstruction in bowel, or perhaps bowel not working properly, feeling like i want to go but nothing there. I just wondered if anyone else has experience of this, at my wits end as i feel that no one will listen to me. I was told by Dr the other day that after nearly 2 years with no period that a 2nd menopause bleed is normal and just hormonal!!!???"

That quickly passed but I am left with so many symptoms. They mostly are fatigue, daily headaches, very painful neck and shoulders, a very odd spaced out sensation and vision like I am wearing really strong glasses - everything looks surreal, I have anxiety like I have never known, I get a tight chest, a lump in my throat, my body feels like a lump of lead, spots, eczema, muscle twitches and my periods have changed with the cycle becoming shorter to 22 days and the bleeding lighter. I also get period pains lasting for a week before my period starts and painful heavy breasts.  I have had a head MRI and CT scan, heart tests, blood tests and it is all normal.

I've had strange and bizarre symptoms on and off the entire time. Most recently I've had major pain in my left armpit. About 4 days BEFORE it started hurting,I went to the doctor for a breast exam and she said my lymph node was slightly swollen but nothing to worry about. I also had a mammogram and ultrasound and the radiologist confirmed it's nothing to worry about. Again, this was all a few days BEFORE it started to hurt. So now for about 3 weeks it's been achy and sore, sometimes prickly,like the armpit hair is rubbing against a tight shirt (but it's not.) All my other peri symptoms are in full force as well....brain fog,sore joints,sore lower back,muscle twitching,hot flashes,night sweats,mouth/gum prickly-ness,cold hands, etc. I'm used to almost all of it except this new armpit pain. Anyone else have this weird wacky symptom and how long have you been dealing with it?"

In the beginning, my periods started coming closer together, then they were coming every other month, and now I haven' had a period since early May. My symptoms all started with heart palpitations and they subsided after a few weeks, maybe a couple months? hard to remember now. But now they're back. They're awful. They happen all day long (but oddly, not while I'm sleeping) and are worse when I'm at rest rather than when I'm active (or maybe I just notice them more). I just don't know how to deal with them. I saw my doctor about them when they first happened years ago and she told me they are more of a nuisance than harmful and to just try to ignore them/adjust to them, so I am hesitant to go back to her (plus the fact that I've put on ~10 pounds since I last saw her). Any tips/suggestions/advice? Thanks!"

I haven't had a definite peri diagnosis yet but i feel so lost. I've had this annoying burning sensation on my skin for the past 2 months, out of nowhere. It started in one thigh and it was quite intense but eased after a while. Ever since then it's pretty much been constant, mainly in my legs and feet, but no where near as intense, and my skin feels hot all over. i have low mood, tiredness, irritability, cry over the slightest thing, tingling/crawling sensations, general aches and pains, anxiety through the roof, brain fog/forgetfulness, occasional palpitations. Just to mention a few 😦Periods also seem to be a bit lighter. I approached my GP who has done full blood work incl FSH and L/H, all of which are normal apparently, and to be honest GP doesn't seem very interested. I was diagnosed with PCOS well over 10 years ago but my periods have been regular since i had my daughter 9 years ago and i've never really had any issues with it apart from acne which i know can happen regardless. I'm only 38 and had never heard of peri until a few weeks ago when a few people mentioned it . Is this possible?

Oestrogen etc. I have over the past year intermittently had stomach pain and bowel problems, diarrhoea, haemorrhoids, which im now thinking are perhaps linked to this Fibroid!

I guess I just need to get this off my chest (pun intended). About a week ago (was ovulating), I noticed a big patch of reddish/pinkish rash which started out as a dry patch. My breasts have always itched since peri but have never produced these rashes. Naturally I freaked out and thought IBC . The rash has gone down now and theres no puckering or nipple changes, neither is the area warm. I haven't applied medicinal cream apart from coconut oil as moisturizer. Of course I obsessively read up about IBC and breast cancer and now I feel like there's a lump in there too (I'm about a week away from my period and probably doesn't help that I've kept probing).

I started with perimenopause at age 42 and now I'm 49 also having anxiety in the worst way. I'm trying not to focus too much but it's hard not to feel anxious. I'm at my moms house now. I feel safe when I'm around her. She's 71 years old and she's already been through it all. Before the perimenopause I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder many years ago. This is all for now.

But some days feel especially dark and bleak; today is one of them. This year has been miserable -- since about March I've been dealing with an exacerbation of things I'd already been dealing with for some time before -- tinnitus, ear pressure, headaches, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, achiness, depression, anxiety...and weird new symptoms, like ""head pressure"" and ""face/head heat"" (""flushing"" doesn't quite seem to describe it). I'm 49 and yup, blood tests by my gynae confirm I am in peri. Of course I'd also seen the ENT and cardiologist, but there has to be a limit to these (expensive) investigations right? Last night I woke up at 2 again, with the tinnitus so loud and the pressure and heat such that I lay there for some time in a desperate palpitating sweat, thinking surely peri can't be this awful, until I finally managed to calm myself down and get back to sleep. But as usual I woke up within 6 hours and feel like s--t, coupled with anxiety and misery about feeling like s--t, if that makes sense. I'm just whining now, feeling so tired and headachey and like I just don't know how to go on, but if anyone else knows what I'm talking about, I'd be glad of the support."
Twinmental,2021-08-04T05:41+00:00,Question for ladies done with menopause...breast pain one side,"I had last period 6 years ago. Been on HRT patches since then but with absolutely no issues. Suddenly, 4 weeks ago, I have developed 24hr pain in my right breast. It is a 5/10 on pain and a 20/10 on worry! Saw gynae yesterday who couldn't feel any lumps (neither can I) and she was quite unconcerned. However my annual screening appt is for Thursday anyway so of course she said go for that. My worry is that I don't see how my boob could suddenly start to hurt badly, always in approx same part of boob, for weeks now after it had basically been quiet for years and years? I'd love to hear from others who have had sudden breast pain (one side) from nowhere in my position. THANK YOU"

I am almost 44 and in the last 3 months have started experiencing terrible heart palpitations and a racing heart, usually in the middle of the night. These symptoms seem to plague me right after my period and then grt better following ovulation. My doctor did blood tests and told me that my hormone levels are 'normal'. My periods are still regular. I rushed to the ER one night thinking I might be having a heart attack, but after an EKG and lots of blood work, they told me I was fine. I also experience shortness of breath, which is odd because I'm in fairly good shape. This all started out of nowhere and has been very unnerving!!!!!! I've also experienced what I believe are several hot flashes. These have also occurred at night - I didn't get sweaty, just felt like my entire body was on fire. All of this has been quite frightening and I'm just reaching out to see if others have had similar experiences. Thank you!"

MizmelzyWI76,2021-08-04T00:50+00:00,Perimenopause and Moods,"I am 44 going on 45 and in perimenopause. I started having hot flashes first that would come on for two weeks and then vanish. It usually coincided with months I didn't get a period. Now I am having a new symptom of being very irritable and moody. I was diagnosed with a generalized mood disorder in my early 20's where I'd get bouts of being very moody and irritable. I'd snap on people for no reason other than they might have been standing next to me. So my doctor put me on antidepressants. They worked for me but I had trouble finding one that didn't mess with my digestion in some way. So eventually in my late 20's I went off of them and did fine. I'd get moody only once in a great while but for the most part I felt normal again. Now since starting perimenopause it's come back almost trifold. I have been in a very moody, irritable mood constantly. Even normal actions become annoying and irritating to me. Something as simple as being deviated from my normal routine can set me off in to a tangent. I can be fine most of the day and something so simple will set me off and I'm cranky and irritated with everyone. I have been in one of those moods for the last three weeks. I have been trying to research natural supplements that may help. I do not want to go back on medication. I hated the way it made me feel, and the side effects. Is there a natural supplement that has been helping anyone? I found an 5 -HTP supplement that had very good reviews. I have started on half the recommended dose and if no adverse reactions increase to normal dosage. Just wondering what everyone else has done to help combat it? The only thing I can do right now is stay away from people when I am in that mood. Lately I just want to be by myself away from everyone. I don't feel depressed or anything. It's just people in general are getting on my nerves just by being in my space, and around me. I am more relaxed and happy by myself. I usually try to do something I enjoy to keep me busy. This seems to help me a lot. Hopefully I can find something that will help me and my mood stay leveled. Melissa"

Hard to see a dentist due to covid but finally dentist filed between the 2 teeth (they were too tight together. During this time my mouth and started to get this burning sensation that worsens throughout the day. It feels like I burnt my tongue on hot soup! Oddly enough it goes away if I am eating or chewing gum. I went recently for a teeth cleaning and explained the issue to my dentist and she sent me to a dental surgeon to see if there was a structural issue but he could not find anything wrong. I am 57 so he put it down to menopause. Is there anything I can take that will relieve these symptoms - cure it or does it go away with time? Really appreciate any replies from those experiencing or know someone who is. Never heard of this syndrome before. Thanks.

Her FSH and LH are significantly raised. Her cortisol is raised and she has had hyperthyroidism that is now under control but the symptoms remain.

I was not working and I went on disability. Then I became more active for a while and it hit me again at 45 and I am needing a lot of rest again. I don;t want to judge myself. I went through child torture and chemical torture in a psychiatric hospital so I have had to take it easy since that happened at 21. My grandfather rested in his room for 25 years so I guess maybe this is normal for my relatives even if they did not have any trauma. But i need to learn to understand that this is MY normal and everyone else's judging based on their over hectic lives need not bother me. I guess I am just looking for some support because I am 50 and 1/2 and I can only stay with people for three hours a day. It is just too much any more than that. And that is OK . Sloths sleep for 21 hours a day. So do babies.

I've just about worn out my welcome at my GP's office, I've been there so often....I've been to the emergency room four times, had an MRI, multiple ECGs, countless rounds of bloodwork, an upper endoscopy...everything comes back clear. So why do I feel so sick all the time? I did have my hormone levels checked, and my doctor confirmed that I'm at least perimenopausal (I'm 45 years old)....could all of these symptoms (and truly, they occur daily) be related to perimeopause?

I started the hormone pellets at the end of last year, have only had three doses. A little over 2 weeks ago I started with dark brown spotting. It has continued and now I feel a heaviness/pressure in my low pelvic area. Transvaginal ultrasound yesterday showed a thickened lining to 7mm and fluid in the lining as well. Also a single fibroid. I am scheduled for a D&C and biopsy on Friday. Has anyone experienced these types of symptoms? Can you share your experiences? I am a nurse and a christian and in no way scared of the possibilities. But the nurse in me is a researcher and I'm gathering as much information as I can."

lisa53645,2021-07-18T01:47+00:00,"Dull, painful leg aches","So happy to see this forum. I'm 58, was early menopause with hysterectomy. I have been on estrogen for 18 years. I want and feel like I need to come off of the estrogen (pill). I have tried once before but the dull leg aches that came after the no estrogen were horrific. I decided that my quality of life was more important than the estrogen so I returned to taking the estrogen and my leg aches went away....i still suffer from insomnia. Here I am a year later and trying again to get off the estrogen and have been reducing very slowly and my deep, dull leg aches have returned. I am taking Tylenol like candy with very little relief. . Anyone else experiencing this? Do the leg aches stop once off estrogen? My ob gyn has never heard of leg aches with low estrogen....I just noticed that the leg aches went away when I started back on the estrogen last year. At my age, I really feel the need to get off HRT. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

I would be interested to hear from anyone else who had this kind of thing develop during peri. I am seeing a cardiologist but it seems there is nothing serious and I am convinced my hormones have a role. I also have a massive list of other symptoms. I am new here, and it's such a relief to find that the bizarre list of hideous weird symptoms is not you going mad. The most debilitating for me are constant GI issues incl reflux, nausea and abdominal pain (had that all checked out last year - ""nothing wrong"" with me); terrible insomnia, crushing fatigue and low motivation; internal buzzing and Vibrations, pins and needles; permanently cold and shivery. My hands are like ice blocks. Also Menstrual cycle has totally changed and is much shorter. Everything aches. Spots. Dry skin and scalp. Headaches. Itching. Muscle twitches. Brain fog and poor concentration. Feel like I permanently have a cold. Tinnitus. I don't even know what libido is any more 🤣 I have had a billion blood tests by the way and I am totally healthy...

To be honest I’m not sure if I’m peri although this was mentioned 2 years ago when I was slightly anaemic and there was talk of the coil.

mymymy,2021-07-07T08:22+00:00,Terrified and alone...,"Hi ladies, I found this forum after feeling terrified and alone and not knowing what to do. I lost my job during co-vid and lost my health insurance, so I can't go to get any tests unless I want crazy medical bills, which I can't afford to pay right now. I started feeling strange and terrifying symptoms starting 6 months ago. They would come and go but right now they are at their worst. I'm 43 and started noticing peri symptoms like constant breast tenderness, heavy bleeding and cramps, insomnia, and spotting/longer days between cycles. Still, my cycles were coming pretty normally, but would vary between 3-5 days longer than the previous cycle. l At the same time, I felt debilitating fatigue, and I have previously been diagnosed with anemia from the heavy bleeding through all of my cycle. One day I was sitting at my desk, and felt like I was going to faint. I felt like I blood wasn't circulating through my legs while seated, and felt short of breath if I sat for too long. My feet were always ice cold. This progressively got worse while sitting at my desk, but I had no issues sitting in my car while driving. Maybe because the seat is reclined and the pressure was on my back? I'm not sure, but it got to the point where I'd have to sit on my bed to work because the softer mattress/blankets put less pressure on my legs/bum. Last week, after a particularly heavy period, I woke up gasping for air, my heart racing, unable to catch my breath. It was truly terrifying; I thought I was dying. After about 15minutes of panicking, I felt better and went back to sleep. The next night, after sitting down at my desk for a minute, the same thing happened - I couldn't catch my breath, and my heart was racing. The next morning, I woke up totally fine with no breathing problems, and went on with my day. Last night, after feeling ok , I sat at my desk once again, and again couldn't catch my breath. I could not sleep last night because I thought I was going to die, and have been in bed all day. I'm terrified to get up because of the heart palpitations/breathing issues, but I know I can't stay in bed all day. I find this all terrifying and perplexing. Yesterday I was totally fine - driving, running errands, with no issues, and today I feel debilitated and in bed, afraid to get up for fear of having a heart attack. I know that I need to see a doctor, but right now, I can't even wrap my head around figuring out how to find affordable health insurance. Do you ladies think this has anything to do with perimenopause? Or does it sound like something totally unrelated? I would appreciate any advice, or words of comfort, as I'm totally alone right now. I already know I need to see a doctor, so please please kindly refrain from telling me to go - I'm working very hard to try to find insurance I can afford. Right now, I 'm just hoping for anyone to relate to anything I'm saying so I don't feel terrified and alone in my thoughts. Thank you for reading all of this, ladies."

quenby25609,2021-07-09T12:44+00:00,"Wake up sick most mornings, feel like I'm dying...","My periods went all irregular about 2 1/2 years ago, after I had my last baby. I was 38 at the time and the very week my first period came back, I woke up feeling sick, with diarrhea, nausea, etc. I didn't connect it to hormones at the time and thought it was food poisoning or a bug. But it kept coming back over and over, always worse at certain times in my cycle. I still deal with it now, waking up every morning early, about 4am with gas, a sudden need to use the bathroom (it's usually only diarrhea at certain points in my cycle) anxious and with my abdomen so tense with nerves it almost hurts. I pace around with freezing cold hands, worrying about everything, sometimes dizzy and shivering, and then it fades out through the morning, and by evening I'm almost always feeling nearly normal again. And I go through it day after day. Some days I'm almost fine when I wake up, and always - again - at the same points in my cycle. So I know it's hormonal, and I know it's connected to my period since I never had this problem until my cycle went all screwy. My ob/gyn said it's perimenopause and that my progesterone is almost nonexistent (she said that's the first hormone to tank, usually) and I just... Is this ever going to stop? I never was like this before. Never had PMS. Never had digestive issues. And now it's ruling my life and I can't see the end of it. Please tell me I'm not the only one."

Generally I am not a good sleeper, never have been, averaging about 5-6 hours a night but I can sleep the clock round now and still don't want to get up. I am still having hot flushes and night sweats so that isn't helping I expect but what I really want to know is, ""Does anyone else feel constantly tired?"" Many thanks in advance Carol"

brigitte90068,2021-07-02T18:34+00:00,Can you get endometrial thickening while on the mini pill (progesterone only)?,I'm on the progesterone only pill called Desogestrel /Cerazette and don't have any bleeding. I did have somw brown discharge in December and then a this year. Every year I have a private ultra sound just to check things. I've just turned 50 and don't really have menopausal symptoms yet except for a light sweat at night if it's very hot and maybe some joint pain (I'm overweight). I think I'm probably peri menopausal. Yesterday's ultrasound showed that my endometrium lining is 5.8mm which has put me into a complete panic. The nurse that did the scan said that this could be normal for someone who is not menopausal and wasn't too concerned. I suffer from terrible health anxietyand am so worried about the 5.8mm measurement. I know that the mini pill is meant to thin the edometrium but could I still be having a type of cycle or still producing oestrogen without bleeding? Thank you

Str8tfans,2018-02-13T15:55+00:00,Last night WHAT was this?!,"Ok y’all, this was bad...it’s happened one other time last year, just wondering if anyone’s ever had an episode like this or not... I was driving home, and all of a sudden I got this weak feeling in my arms, my head felt really heavy and almost “buzzing” if that makes sense?  Next it was like this “rush” or “flush” of a feeling that I felt like from my waist or around there slowing all the way up to my head and down my arms.  I FREAKED out so the panic started, heart beating SO fast, and I got the shakes bigtime. It took me probably an hour to “come down”.  I wasn’t sweating at all, but the only thing that made me ok enough to finish the drive was putting the air on full blast and blowing it right at my face. I’ve heard of women having hot flashes without sweating- was that it?  I got immediate like gurgling digestive stuff afterwards.  And also after had a minor headache. I was literally exhausted afterwards also. I was so scared I texted my boyfriend and was like PLEASE come over here. He didn’t miss a beat and showed up right away...was very supportive but it still freaked me out because idk what it was!!  My arms felt very weak afterwards.  Today, waking up, I didn’t feel “too” bad, but still a little weak. Have the front of head/between eyes pressure today. And little shooting pains in my neck/throat area, not that that part is related but thought I’d mention it. Anyways- who has had an episode like this, and if you have, and went to the doctor, what was the diagnoses or outcome?  Thanks in advance ladies- I’m freaking out :-("

I randomly had few days of spotting/ light bleeding so as I was classed as post menopausal was referred to hospital on the 2 week pathway. All blood tests and swabs have come back fine but today when I attended my appointment I was unable to proceed with the hysteroscopy as I found it too painful ( I’m a massive wimp with stuff like that anyway) . My consultant suggested I come back for a general anaesthetic to have it done which I’m happy about. All I was able to have done was my internal scan. The consultant said I would need a biopsy almost as soon as he began the scan which has really frightened me thinking he seen something terribly wrong right away. Anyone had a similar experience? What was the outcome? So frightened. Would be very interested to hear your experiences! All answers appreciated xx

Prior to that, my periods were closer together, then 6 months of nothing. Last summer a regular period (at 53!). Then from October until June silence. I thought I was heading into menopause and was pretty stoked. Last week, my period reappeared. It was ridiculously average (think in your 30's) period. 5 days long, Heaviest second day. Tapering on days 4-5. Average cramping. I know this is not an exact science. But to have my period return like I am at the height of my fertility window is emotionally and physically decimating. My health anxiety is raging. I am also scared that the uterine lining is building and not shedding and I am going to die from cancer. (I had a uterine ultrasound last July and everything was fine. But that does not stop health anxiety.) I have an appointment with my gyn for an ultrasound and office visit on Friday. I am trying to hold it together until then.

I stopped it on her advice and moved to homeopathy which worked wonders with the anxiety. however I still have air hunger and terrible hot flushes with palpitations. I'm almost 49. I have no sisters and my mum suffers from dementia so asking her about menopausal symptoms is out of the question. are menopausal symptoms hereditary? I'm trying to understand if the meropenem had anything to do with all that I went thru. do Asians gave greater/lesser symptoms? I live im India and read somewhere that race does play a role in how bad you get. do the symptoms ease at all? I mean am I going to get old and still have this. I'm not on any medication now except for mild herbal vitamins... please guide. I'm very confused, fatigued and really have no inclination to work. that makes me guilty all the time."

I'm 44, healthy, have had 2 children (in my 20's) and have been on birth control pill since the birth of the last one 20 years ago. I don't really have any real signs of menopause except for 2 years ago, I began getting awful headaches a few days before my period. I told my dr. about it and she immediately said it's your hormones plummeting at that time due to age. She prescribed me progesterone pills and estradiol to use at various times during my cycle. I've was on it for over a year and no change at all in the headaches. In fact, I noticed nothing from using the progesterone and estrogen at all. I was told since I was getting nothing from it, to go ahead and stop using it. Wanted to also mention, I have no other symptoms. No hot flashes, no heavy period, no depression, nothing, JUST the horrible migraine like headaches that can last for several days. No medicines help at all. I also don't get headaches at any other time of the month so it's definitely related to my cycle somehow. Pharmacist who is the hormone specialist (at a compounding pharmacy) suggested I try a supplement called DIM. That was the most awful experience ever. Within 36 hours, I had a crippling migraine and was vomiting all night. I stopped after 3 pills and was better. Threw it in the trash. I don't know what else to do and neither does my dr. Has anyone here experienced anything similar who can offer any insight on what I can do. I feel there are no other options from my dr. Thank you!"

Gigi368,2021-06-07T07:11+00:00,I'm afraid to ask what's next...,"Hello Lovelies! I hope everyone is hanging in there! It's been a while since I posted any rants Lol... I've been dealing with meno symptoms like everyone else, for several years now, I just turned 53, I had a hysto 20 yrs ago but kept my ovaries. I've been convinced for the last year and a half that there's more than the classic ""66 symptoms"" as I have about a million! A year ago I woke up one morning to my right eye swollen and hot where the eye bags show up and blood in my left eye. Went to Urgent Care and they told me it was peri orbital cellulitis, put me on antibiotics and eye drops. It didn't help so I went to my GP, he literally told me to go see a therapist because there was nothing to treat, as it had went down by the time I got an appointment. Several times it flared back up and off I went to see him, even with the swelling and the fire red bags he said nothing was wrong. As time went by I noticed my eyes starting to bulge and my eye lids stay swollen, so again another appointment. Again he said go see a therapist. I had enough, and I started yelling at him.. my vision was changing, my eyes were starting to bug out of my head, stabbing pains behind my eyes, and either dry or non stop watering.. I demanded a referral to see an eye doc. Keep in mind I've been after him for over a year to help me. He finally gave in and sent me to an ophthalmologist in March, who said even with out blood tests I have Thyroid eye disease!!! He did blood work and a CT scan which showed the thickening of the muscles behind my eyes and some nerve damage. I've been back to be measured and he wants to wait until I see an Endocrinologist, which I just did on the 4th before he starts treatment. So, the Endo ran a ton of tests and I JUST got the the blood work results (she even tested my FSH, LH and Estradiol levels, which confirms I'm POST meno, first time I've had these tests since in the U.S. the doc's consider these pointless bc they change often.) Anyway she hasn't called yet since the test results just got posted today, so I expect she'll call this week, but she's thinking I MAY have Graves Disease.. I'm freaked out because the treatment for that can cause thyroid eye disease which I already have, and the treatment for TED is pretty harsh even with a new treatment that was just approved in the US. I have zero idea what symptoms belong to my thyroid or my lacking hormones... my anxiety is thru the ROOF!! Here's some of my numbers, they are definitely dropping but I won't know what they mean until my doc calls me.. TSH 4/11/14 3.35 11/1/17 1.95 12/21/20 1.538 3/30/21 1.58 6/4/21 1. 2487 T4 Free 3/30/21 1.09 ng/dL 6/4/21 0.90 ng/dL T3 Total 3/30/21 2.9 6/4/21 1.08 ng/dL Thyrotropin Receptor Antibody <1.10 IU/L Cortisol 6/4/21 @ 12:45 p.m.5.1 ug/dL ug/dL Cortisol AM 6.2 - 19.4 Cortisol PM 2.3 - 11.9 C-Peptide 6/4/21 4.2 ng/mL LH 6/4/21 38.8 mIU/mL Postmenopausal Females without HRT 5.16-61.99 mIU/mL FSH 6/4/21 72.98 mIU/mL Post Menopausal Females 26.72 - 133.41 mIU/mL Estradiol 6/4/21 7.0 pg/mL Postmenopausal <6.0 - 54.7 At least I know I'm not peri meno any more (even though I'm midline with the numbers) and hopefully those symptoms start fading soon LOL... who am I kidding, I think I'll have them the rest of my life!! It's been wonderful not having a monthly cycle to deal with but not having it I had zero idea where I was in the process because I had no period to miss and judge by. Anyway sorry for the long post! I had to rant LOL... if my stupid doc would have listened to me this could have been taken care of before I got to this point!! My advise to anyone struggling with issues, is be your own advocate! Don't let the doc's bully you or make you feel like your crazy, it's your body, you know when something is wrong! FIGHT THEM until you get answers!!!!"

I have been noticing some other symptoms lately such as night sweats, not often but to the point where I have to change my pajamas, dry hair, dry skin, my periods went from every 4 weeks to every 3 about a year and a half ago. Sometimes they are long, sometimes they are 2 days. I saw my dr and a neurologist about the internal vibrations last summer and had an MRI, cleared of MS. I found this forum shortly after and saw some many women saying they too have these vibrations, so I assumed it was my hormones as well. Lately I have been having some scary brain fog moments: wanting to call objects by the wrong name, pulling into the wrong drive at work, throwing things out in the wrong place, etc. My father had dementia at an early age and passed away last year. Obviously, I am terrified I am heading down the same path. I saw my NP at my last gyno appointment 2 weeks ago. I mentioned the vibrations and brain fog and she immediately shot down any idea of me being in peri. She said because I still have regular periods and I am too young to be in peri and she never heard of internal vibrations as part of peri, which I was not surprised by. She just kept telling me to call my primary dr. I explained I did last year and even sought out a neurologist on my own. She just kept saying to reach out to my primary. So I did and have an appointment this week. Needless to say, these last 2 weeks have been anxiety filled and I keep making more and more mistakes. Anyone else going through this? Anyone have stories of brain fog? I'm a mess. Sorry for the long post."

But then I ovulate, and in the second half of my cycle I have no energy or enthusiasm for anything. Knowing that it's only going to last a couple of weeks is the only thing that gets me through it. But, the thing is, I spend roughly equal amounts of time in each state, so I don't really know which one is the ""real"" me, if there even is such a thing. So I'm starting to wonder, what happens after menopause? Everything I've found online says that PMDD goes away after menopause, but which version of me will be going? Will I be my best self all the time, or will I be stuck in unending depression? I'm 48 and don't have any menopausal symptoms yet, but this is starting to worry me. Any advice from people who have gone through menopause after years of PMDD would be very much appreciated. Thanks!"

I am new to this group and THANKFUL I FOUND YOU ALL because I feel like I have so many uncomfortable symptoms that have started in the past few months 😦(((( I will be 50 in November and my periods have been very heavy but regular for years. Past few months I have had really bad aches and pains that seem to move around in my body. Left should blade pain to back pain to hip pain, sharp shooting pain in above my collar bone near my right shoulder, and a lot of upper abdominal pain below my ribs and that one travels around from one side to another and just kind of stays there all day. I just finished this month's menstrual cycle two days ago and some of the pain seems to be decreasing but my upper stomach area feels like there is still some pressure. This whole stomach pain has been worrying me a lot. The pain is usually pretty dull and more like a constant pressure but it lingers all day. I had my hormone levels checked for the first time and they are: FSH 53.0, Estradiol <50, and Luteinizing Hormone 9.6 I can't find a good source to tell me what these values mean in terms of being near menopause. I think the FSH indicates a menopause level even though I still get my periods? I had the labwork drawn at the tail end of my period so I think that the levels fluctuate. Do you ladies who do experience any symptoms have them constantly throughout the month regardless of whether you are on your period or do they seem worse during? Would appreciate you sharing how frequently you experience these nasty symptoms and if they seem worse during certain times and if you get upper stomach pain similar to what I have described, I would like to hear about it if you are open to sharing. I am just starting to become a little anxious about my overall health and I never used to worry so much. Thank you so much for reading and I hope someone replies."

Im 40 and think im going through early stages of menopause. I have endometriosis/adenomyosis and during ivf 3 years ago my hormone levels were low and egg reserve very limited. Recently i have been very anxious and had 2 panic attacks in 3 months from nowhere one when driving and other lasted 6 hours and ended up in A&E! I have brain fog and most days find im breathless even when walking around. Sounds weird but when driving on motorway to work sometimes i feel like i have tunnel vision and its too busy and cant concentrate on roads and all too much. I feel like someone could click their fingers and i will pass out as get so foggy and tired. I can be fine and suddenly get over whelming fatigue and feel like i will pass out and fall asleep!! I have a heavy weight on chest in middle and feel like a lump is in my throat, belching loads. Doctor thought was anxiety and put me on meds due to panic attacks but came off them after 5 days as made me so ill. I really do believe its not just anxiety as body just doesnt feel right. My periods have always been heavy/clotting but now are every 20 days with spotting prior. I have aching joints and pain in body and bloods all okay. I feel like i know something is wrong but so hard to explain to others as sounds odd. I am going to book to see my consultant to check my hormone levels and hopefully get some answers.

Suki_girl,2020-06-28T14:09+00:00,Post meno and doing fine but don’t assume every symptom is meno related,"Hi all. I haven't been on here for a long time as, basically, I am post menopause (had my last period about 2 years ago). I have been through it and came out the other side fine. All those nasty meno symptoms (e.g. hot flushes, night sweats, brain fog, unpredictable and heavy periods, exhaustion) had gone post meno and I felt good. I, however, would like to warn women going through menopause not to just assume that all symptoms are meno related. After about a year of feeling great again I started to become extremely, overwhelmingly exhausted. I knew this was a symptom of meno and assumed it was not quite over yet. Months later I got a painful, swollen toe and assumed I must have banged it and forgotten I had. Then the swelling spread to my whole foot and my other foot. I looked this symptom up and sure enough swelling is a symptom of meno. But, I thought, just in case I'll get it checked - by this time I was having problems wearing shoes. I went to the GP, they did a blood test and it was positive for rheumatoid factor - I had rheumatoid arthritis. Within a matter of weeks it has spread to every joint and I was shuffle walking, unable to use my hands and spent all day lying on the sofa because moving was so painful and I had the horrible fatigue that does with the condition. Turns out the fatigue is often the first symptom experienced. But seeing the GP when I was just at the swollen foot stage got me into the NHS rheumatoid arthritis service and on treatment within the 12 weeks recommended - if you get treated within that time you are more likely to achieve permanent remission. It took 5 months but I am now in remission - not completely back to normal, the RA lets me know it is still there, but not in pain, able to move and the fatigue has gone. RA is more likely in women and is often triggered by menopause. So don't ignore symptoms and assume they are caused by meno - get them checked."
Suki_girl,2019-03-18T12:58+00:00,How women experience menopause and the impact of culture,"This is not a question or request for advice but, as a result of some other discussions on here I recently became interested in how culture and society effects women's experience of menopause. I thought I'd post my findings in case anyone else is interested. Research that shows that, despite the symptoms women experience being more or less the same wherever they are in the world, those living in cultures that revere and promote youth (e.g. the US and UK) report experiencing worse symptoms. Conversely, in other cultures menopause is celebrated e.g. Hazda women in Tanzania celebrate the onset of menopause, and menopausal women are among the most valued members of their society (like it!) From the 'woman in balance institute': The most important factor determining a woman’s experience of menopause is the culture in which she finds herself before, during, and after menopause: In our youth-idolizing Western culture, menopause can seem like an ending. However, in many cultures, menopause is a time of new respect and freedom for women. A study reported that Mayan women, although experiencing some uncomfortable symptoms, looked forward to menopause, as it provided newfound freedom and status (Stefanopoulou). Marcha Flint found that in Rajasthan, India, women who were veiled and secluded before menopause, could now “come downstairs from their women’s quarters to where the men talked and drank home brew” and could publicly visit and joke with men after menopause (Flint 1975). Do American women report more symptoms of menopause because of the impact of our Western lifestyle choices and stress levels on hormones? Or is it that we live in a culture where menopause is sometimes treated as a “disease"", rather than the transformative and elevating experience it is in other cultures?"""

I'm strict with my diet, cut out lactose and all the 'red' foods that trigger IBS but still suffer. has anyone else experienced this ? thank you in advance"
Guest,2006-07-28T17:23+00:00,"Hi, I'm 46, and I think I may be having some Menopausal ...","Hi, I'm 46, and I think I may be having some Menopausal symptoms. I am the most horrid person to live with at the moment, my kids suffer, my husband suffers and I don't know what to do! I am having what I can only describe as hot/cold sweats. One minute I am hot and the next I feel cold and shivery, it seems like when you have a fever from an infection. Is this what hot flushes are like? I don't get all red in the face, but I feel terrible. I also have an amazing ability to shout at evryone really loudly, usually for no reason, I was going to leave my husband 2 days ago, I am insufferable at the moment. Mood swings isn't the word!, I have no energy, and really not much interest in doing much at all, I fell fat, ugly and can't stop eating. Pleases can someone tell me if these are symptoms and what is the best way to treat them. PS Off to see the Doc on Tuesday, maybe she can help me out.

Takingtime,2018-01-07T20:02+00:00,Globus sensation,"Hi everyone!  My apologies if this has been asked on here before.  Has anyone ever developed a sensation in their throat that feels like there is something in the throat, or at times feels like you are being strangled?  This started for me about 5 months ago....and seems to be a chronic thing....sometimes it will go away for a week or two, or even a day or two but then returns. A few doctors suggested GERD.....one thought maybe anxiety.....I wonder if it is muscle related....I don't wake up with it and it seems to show up halfway through the day and I feel relief when I eat something.  I just started seeing an osteopath and she things it is the upper esophagus spasming, and tells me she will work on it at next treatment.   I am going to call for an appointment to get a modified barium swallowing test where they look at how the muscles are working....I am not sure where they go from there, but I am not game for having an endoscopy shoved down my throat because I don't feel that is going to prove anything.   I wondered though if this is peri related only because leading up to this I have had so many hormonal issues (according to gynocologist and urologist) and it seems that this has followed those things.....I also had shingles in February of last year, so I feel like my body has taken quite the whipping the last little while.....just curious if any of you have this, have you been diagnosed or treated, or better yet have you been able to get rid of it?"
DeeLad23351,2021-04-26T14:42+00:00,"Vaginal Odor 1-1/2 years, Desperate for Help!","Hi everyone! So I am post-menopausal, 54 years old. My GYN background is normal, never had abnormal PAP smear or any issues other than the dryness and atrophy from menopause, and also some vaginal scar tissue from pelvic radiation three years ago. (It was not a GYN-related cancer, and I am now cancer free.) I use vaginal dilators regularly with water based lube to keep the vaginal scar tissue from progressing. I have no urine leakage as far as I know, or any abnormal discharge issues. I use prescription estradiol suppositories, and Ambien for sleep, plus multivitamins, but other than that, no medications. About a year and a half ago, I started noticing vaginal odor that I could smell all the time, through my clothes. It's not fishy, but it seems to have several smells. From a raw hamburger meat smell to a strong kind of dirty soapy smell (probably from washing) to a slightly sweet smell, to just a strong musky hard to explain smell. I smell it with my clothes on and this has taken over my life. My GYN has basically closed my case as she can't find a thing wrong, and have only been told ""sometimes a woman's natural smell just changes over time."" But I can't get away from the smell, and it is not normal. I've tested negative for yeast infection, BV, UTI, had normal PAP smear, had intra-vaginal ultrasound and regular ultrasound, all normal. Tried prescription Metronidazole, Ph balancing products, OTC probiotics, tried suppositories for vaginal dryness/atrophy, tried boric acid suppositories, tried soaking in apple cider vinegar, drinking apple cider vinegar, not wearing underwear, not using washes with fragrance, using many kinds of natural sprays and wipes. I tried stopping the estradiol tabs, that didn't work. I tried going off my vitamins for a month, I cut down on sugars and have a pretty normal diet, nothing in excess. I even wondered if it was a hormone imbalance, so I tried taking OTC hormone and hormone-free pills, which were short lived because I've been told that they're dangerous since they're not FDA regulated. This odor is beginning to cause major depression and has affected my life and my decisions in so many ways. Too many to list here, but before this started, I wouldn't have realized just what being smelly can do to a person's life. Again, they've found no infection anywhere, no issues. My GYN has nothing left to say about it. I am frustrated and depressed, and time after time, I try to find answers online and see NOTHING other than ""bacterial vaginosis."" I've talked to my GI also and my GP. No answers. Thanks for reading this long-winded story! Does anyone have any ideas, or has anyone had this issue? Thanks ahead for any replies."

Going slightly mad!,"Morning everyone, Im 49 , the big 50 later this year,I know it may sound naive but up until 6 months ago was relatively healthy, active, happy, fun to be with kind of girl! But since then have started feeling really achy, really tired, emotional not sleeping, awake for hrs upon end! Had palpitations for 3 months , finally ended up being picked up by ambulance, taken to local hospital, thought I was having a heart attack, they couldnt find anything after multiple tests, having a heart monitor fitted under the skin, so they have a record of whats going on, little monitor at side of my bed that reads the goings on through the night!Attractive huh! Feel about 95!Felt so ill, frightened, but all tests results came back negative , so asked why I was feeling this way to be honest passed from pillar to post with no real help, so started doing some research of my own, then asked the question? Could I be perimenopausal! Finally got someone to listen,after breaking down, Im not a negative person and am always there for everyone, but cant shake these awful feelings, don't feel like me , look at myself don't actually even see me !HRT was suggested , my doc said you should feel some relief after 2 weeks, Ive been on 1mg Elleste Duet for now nearly 6 weeks ....slept slightly better , little less achy, but generally feel the same! Ive spoken to my GP today and its now suggested I up the dosage got a new prescription to pick up later today! I feel a bit like a guinea pig, but am so desperate, I'm also looking into alternatives, to try and assist but because I feel so low haven't got my usual drive! I have been an active person worked full time raised 4 kids, now it takes me all my time to clean the house.....which I'm making myself do , because if I'm not in control of something , scared of who I will become! Reading this back to myself , I feel pathetic, never thought I would take HRT but never ever thought I would feel like this! My heart goes out to each and everyone of you however you are suffering!❤ Sending big hugs to everyone, feel like Im going slightly mad! ❤ *"

I’ve seen countless doctors and 2 dermatologists and have had numerous tests which haven’t found anything. I’m perimenopausal and had a Mirena coil fitted last April. I also have a bio identical Estrogen gel I use daily. Everything was fine until this started but as the itchy/crawly/prickly sensation is now constant I struggle to even hold a conversation at times. I’ve tried elimination diets and binning my skincare and haircare products etc but nothing. Does this sound like a peri or menopause symptom? The Mirena coil stopped my periods so I have no idea if I’ve reached menopause or not. I’m really at my wits end and if it continues getting worse I’ll have to give up my job. Life will get pretty bad after that I feel. Help!!!!!"

I have maybe 1 wk a month where I feel GREAT, I feel like my old self. then it's like I hit a brick wall. when this happens I can barely function. I have extreme fatigue, weakness, knee pain, anxiety, migraines, and the worse symptom of all is a weird hard to explain feeling in my brain. it is like I am in a haze, I cant make decisions, I cant get things done like simple things, I could literally just sit and stare at the wall if that makes sense? I absolutely hate this feeling the most. there is nothing I can do to help this, I have to literally wait for it to pass, which is usually right when my period ends and then I'm good for the wk or so and then it begins all over again. can perimenopause (hormones) make you feel this bad?

I'm 50 and been dealing with recurring nausea that has gotten worse the last two months. I have a week and a half before my period I feel good. On bad days it feels like morning sickness. On a decent day I may gag brushing my teeth, but on really bad days I may dry heave and then feel sick most of the day. I've had lots of blood work, upper GI & colonoscopy, ultrasound, etc. but so far everything points to perimenopause. I am having thyroid (autoimmune) flare for first time in 25 years, which may not help but my thyroid isn't way off. I'm an 11-year breast cancer survivor so hormone replacement is probably not recommended. I have new Naturopathic doctor who just started to help me, but I'd appreciate any tips. Yes I'm trying ginger and things but its not enough. This is really affecting my quality of life. Thanks!"
heather29740,2019-06-21T12:08+00:00,Really Menopause !!!!,"I am 56 and four years post menopausal. Now here's my question I read the forum every day and the amount of illnesses that seem to be put down to peri/menopause is incredible from a sore wee toe to serious problems. I agree with the anxiety/depression side of things as hormones are associated with the brain. I have sore parts of my body but I put it down to being grossly overweight and not moving as often as I should, if I have digestive problems I put that down to I've ate something that doesn't agree with me like the previous forty years of my life. There have been women on here in the past few days that say they feeling pins and needles and numbness on their faces and other women are saying this is menopause, these types of problems should be checked by a professional not diagnosed by all of us. I have been on here asking for advice on post menopausal bleeding because there are many women that have went through this and they can clearly give me advice but I certainly wouldn't ask for advice on something as serious as numbness or tingling as this is a doctor's job. I know that someone will have a different view of this but alas this is life and everyone is entitled to an opinion."

Guest,2019-09-16T19:23+00:00,When hormones aren't balance/symptoms,"I've been reading the yin and yang of menopause and it's really interesting. It describes different body types and what symptoms can go along with that. He also says that symptoms come, not from falling hormones, but when the three hormones get out of balance (helped through diet, herbs, emotions, haven't gotten that far yet in my reading). Thought you would find these symptoms interesting, and familiar.. Estrogen dominant symptoms: Cold (especially hands and feet), weight gain, fibroid/cyst growth, sadness/depression, muscle weakness, delayed menopause, longer menstrual cycles Progesterone dominant symptoms: Heat (hot flashes), excessive weight loss, muscle tightness, depression/anxiety, mild acne, mood swings, breast tenderness, loss of libido Testosterone dominant symptoms: Absence of menstrual cycle/shorter cycles, infertility, moderate/severe acne, excessive hair growth, anger/rage, early menopause, headaches As you can see, it pretty much covers many of the symptoms we all suffer here. And in sasang medicine they believe in 7 year cycles. So in our 6th or 7th cycle (after puberty) is when our meno starts (so 42 to 49 years). Looking back at my meno journey I can definitely see which hormone was dominant at different times. Can you?"

I am mildly affected by CFS/M.E. but have found that since becoming perimenopausal 6 years ago that the pain when I get a flare-up is neuropathic and fibromyalgia-like which I hadn't really experienced before. Also I am sure that I have a lower threshold to having a flare-up/relapse of M.E. and it results in an intensifying of my menopausal symptoms. I went on HRT a couple of years ago which helped, but am considering a higher dose and/or testosterone because I am finding my fatigue/memory/concentration and mood is much worse now. I would like to take on more responsibility at work, but when I tried recently, it floored me."

I feel terrible and as this brings on waves of wooziness along with an elevator floor drop feeling in my head. I'm not sure if its anxiety, hormones, tension headaches, migraines?

It started just over a month ago. I went from being someone who has never had any trouble sleeping to suddenly having a really awful time with it. When I am falling asleep I get random jerks and twitches all over me body. Like my shoulder would jerk, then my leg, then my hand and so on. Each jerk causes a nervous sensation in my stomach and then I become incredibly anxious wondering when the next jerk is going to come, and therefore it takes me hours to fall asleep and its absolute hell. I had a couple of weeks where I barely noticed it and slept quite well, then just when I thought it was much better, it comes back, which is why I think it's hormonal. I've contacted my doctor and he wants to do bloods to see if anything flags up. I'm nearly 45 and also suffer with the internal tremors, weak arms and legs, palpitations, headaches, itching, acid reflux, vertigo, tinnitus and crippling anxiety."

SamanthaJane81,2021-03-18T21:07+00:00,Feeling Alone.,"Hello Ladies, This is my first time posting, after reading some of your posts I finally feel like I might fit in somewhere after months of holding in a roller coaster of emotions. I am 39, 40 in april, and sincle last summer I have been noticing strange symptoms that would come and go, I was admitted to hospital last July as I went to AnE with tingling in my hands and leg cramps, turned out i had very low calcuim levels, which was sorted, but the whole hospital stay I found very traumatic, I can't tell you how many times they brought up cancer and other illnesses while they were investigating why I would have such low calcuim levels, I brought up whether it might be that I am in Peri - menopause, but that was shrugged off due to my age, to be honest the whole ordeal has really stuck with me. After the hospital stay I was also diagnosed with low iron which has been an on going issue on and off for years as my periods are so heavy. I was then checked again in October by an endocrine consultant, everything was ok (except iron), I brought up Peri- menopause again as I had been suffering with other symptoms, my periods although regular have shortened in length but have become very heavy for the first 2 days/painful and my mum hit peri around my age also, but he said the blood test they did was fine and shut me down, and said possible long covid. I was due to be seen again in January, which has been postponed due to covid. Well since last year I have been whats felt like a never ending rollercoaster 😦 , I have never suffered with anxiety before and now I am frightened to be alone, I seem to focus on health, petrified I am dying of some terminal illness but too scared to do anything about it, I have symptoms that bounce from one to another to name a few.. racing heart wakes me up in the middle of the night, backache that comes and goes, joint pain sometimes stiffness in the morning, odd pains here and there, muscle twitches, heartbeat feels it skips every now and then, low mood, irritability, anger and inability to tolerate what I would normally, vivid dreams, tension in my neck and shoulders, clenching my jaw and more recently hot red hands, sunburn feeling in places and burning tongue .. I cannot believe how much I have changed in a year 😦 I have had a lot of stress, I am a mum to three, two of my children have additional needs, asd, adhd, spd, and my youngest (5 year old) also has type 1 diabetes, she was diagnosed at 2 and I also care for my mum who is pretty much housebound. I feel so alone, everyone around me thinks I am becoming a hypercondriac 😦 and not understanding. Thank you if you got this far, I am sorry for the long post, I just really needed to open up to others that might understand."

Lately, I've had these strange sensations in my muscles. They feel weak and just weird- like i have tight rubber bands wrapped around them. But also like they're buzzing with electricity. Happens all over my body- arms, legs, face, head, neck, chest, stomach. A few years ago, when peri first started showing up, my doc thought my symptoms might be MS. She sent me to a specialist, who did some assessments and determined it wasn't. But I still find myself freaking out about it, when these weird muscle sensations appear. Anybody have this issue? Sure would help to hear from you, if you do. 😃"

The weird part was that an hour or so later, it happened again. I've never had two in the same day. My first aura happened when I was 43 in October, 2018. It was so scary as I had never heard of an aura before that day. I was at work and was taken to the ER. I had another one three days later and then two days after that for a total of three. Then, I was good for over a year and had another on New Year's Day 2019. Then, I was good until the other day. I have crippling anxiety because of them. I find them so scary. I just don't know how to cope. Any one have any words of wisdom or encouragement? I should also mention that I have seen a neurologist and had scans (CT, MRI, MRA).

On top of all this.. I'm hardly sleeping, which I just can't cope with. Today I couldn't go into work because I just couldn't face it after another night having a couple of hours sleep. When I did drift off I had nightmares. I really need some advice from others on anything you've found to help. I'm currently trying black cohosh and cod liver oil tablets, but I don't think they're helping. I thought they were but I had a light period and I think that's the only reason I felt better for a week or so. It was bliss to get a good nights sleep. I've made an appointment at the doctors, but having been previously and finding they're not really that helpful, I'd much prefer to take some advice from others who are going through, or have gone through this.

sally78132,2021-03-04T11:48+00:00,Period after 2 years without,"Hello, I'm 55 and haven't had period for just over 2 years, until two weeks ago when I started bleeding and it was exactly same as my periods, I even had tender breasts for days before which I'd already put down to my bra being tight due to lockdown weight gain! I had the cramps etc as with any period, and it stopped after 5 days, nothing since. GP ref to hospital but I ended up at hysteroscopy clinic where the consultant scared the hell out of me by saying I'd be given 4 injections into my cervix which wouldn't stop the procedure hurting but would avoid problems with my blood pressure - oh, and the 4 injections are extremely painful!! I wasn't prepared to have this done because I hadn't even had a TVU scan, so am booked in for that tomorrow, then back to hysteroscopy clinic next week for that if the scan suggests it is actually necessary. I sometimes have a little niggle low down on my left hand side which I've noticed since the period, and have convinced myself I have ovarian cancer 😦It's all going round in my head of course, the ups and the downs. Just wanted to ask here whether ladies have generally found the sonographer at the TVU scan to be able to give some results immediately, or am I likely to have to wait? Also, would I be better if I have to have hysteroscopy, asking for no anaesthetic if that's the bit that hurts worse? I feel so wimpy but am thinking I might ask for GA - but then I and my family have to self isolate for 10 days before the op. Sorry I know I'm jumping ahead, but hey, that's what we do when faced with these things isn't it?!"
jamie50513,2016-04-03T19:37+00:00,Dreaming..Peri/Meno or Not??,"Hi Ladies, I believe I have posted about this before, but I can't remember. I've had many things happen in the last 5 months in regards to this hormone imbalance thing. I have been having some vivid, crazy, and some scary dreams. I've had nightmares before but this seems to be in excess lately and immediately after I fall asleep. I never have a full night sleep, I either wake several times or I wake around 3-4 am and can't get back to sleep. I've been very tired lately which is new. Even though I don't sleep well at night, I'm usually pretty ok during the day. Does anyone else have this issue with dreams? I thought it may be side effects from my meds or a connection to this peri/meno. What do you all think?"

pethate46,2021-03-02T10:17+00:00,Finally taken the plunge and commenced HRT,"After entering the 7th year of perimenopausal hell, Ive made the decision to commence HRT. My painful and fatiguing hands and wrists were the last straw. Ive done heaps of research, in line with the latest advice and truths (not based on the biased studies from the WHI in 2003). I also recommend the book ""How to Thrive in Menopause"" by Ginni Mansberg, an Australian GP who is registered with the AMS. I am 46 but had to have a baseline mamogram & ultrasound to ensure there was nothing abnormal there that could become a problem down the track. I made sure I was prescribed body identical (not to be confused with bioidentical) eostradiol and progesterone (not synthetic progestin) in the form of a transdermal patch to (bypass the liver) and progesterone pills. Only started last night so I will keep you all posted on my progress."
eloise2021,2021-02-17T04:59+00:00,Please need sympathy and your top tips,"Am new to forum and reading loads of threads but also just need to offload myself. I am in early menopause - as in early stages but also younger than 97% of women when they start it - which is itself isolating and weirdly shameful (whenever I mention the topic, people, even doctors, don't initially believe me because of my age - and then it becomes this jokesy thing where I am having to laugh it off) and bringing up some other crap because my mother had early meno too but didn't tell me - so some background stuff there because I struggled to conceive and had to work out myself that I was already in ovarian failure). Anyway, here is my cocktail of symptoms: Exhaustion - to point of feeling like I've been in a brawl or had a really aggressive massage All over muscle cramps and aches, sometimes sharp pains, sometimes stiffness Plantar fasciitis to point that I sometimes feel I can't walk on feet Anxiety especially in the middle of the night - and I jump at loud noises etc Itchy, spider-crawly skin Low libido/ dryness Weight gain around middle Hair loss Lower control over temper (we really are just turning into old men, aren't we?!) Less joy, less confidence than normal I read someone saying that getting hormones back in balance should be treated by workplaces like pregnancy. Agree! Adding to the low mood is that I am very likely going to have to unpaid leave to deal with this. I am someone who typically doesn't take medication and gets nervous about having to experiment on myself (with HRT). Anyway, I will need to get over this, but not helping. Meanwhile, I feel like even my very professional and good-hearted GP thinks I am bonkers. When I mention my symptoms as probably hormone related, she says comments to effect of most women don't go through this. But then when I say, 'well, do you think we should check for other things?' (eg arthritis, MS etc), she says I am being anxious/catastrophising. Anyway, just can't really talk about it with family (like many of you, my mother says she barely noticed menopause and she quickly changes subject) or friends (none has yet experienced this) and my husband is lovely and well-meaning but obviously can't relate and can't really advise. Would appreciate sympathy (even of the tough sort) and any tips/recommendations on HRT or other treatment from here. Will continue reading - the threads and links etc. Seeing doctor tomorrow. She wants me to go on HRT where fertility not wiped out completely but I think I should just go on what's healthiest and most effective... Thank you!"
lesley55485,2020-12-26T14:58+00:00,Neck pain before ovulation and a period,"Hi, So over the last few months I've noticed that just before I ovulate I get an achy neck. It starts in my neck both sides under my ears. Then it progresses down into my collar bone and shoulders. It's much more painful on the left side. This happens for a couple of days then eases. Then it comes back worse and more painful a day or so before a period arrives, this tends to be the only way I know a period will be appearing. When it happens before the period its a much more intense pain. It starts the same place at either side of neck under the ears but it makes my whole neck stiff and achy, my glands swell slightly and it makes my collar bone and left shoulder very painful. It also causes my neck to crack and creak. When it's like this it also makes my face ache in front of my ears, in my jaw and around my eyebrows and in my eye sockets. Does anyone else get this? I'm currently not on any HRT after an incident with the Femoston I was on causing my BP to spike dangerously high (never had high BP issues before that) and migraines that lasted 3 or 4 days. 1 of the migraines caused a bleed behind my eye due to high pressure. So I'm now dealing with partial sight loss too. I do think the neck pain is due to a dip in estrogen,im only on cerazette birth control at the minute. I think my body needs the estrogen, but my doctor is reluctant to prescribe as she's worried that's what's caused the migraines and high BP. I'm hoping to see her in the new year to see what I can have to help. I am currently taking vit D3, evening primrose oil, B complex vitamin. 😒 Just fed up of the neck pain as nothing seems to ease it, painkillers just mask it, hot wheat packs help a bit as does a hot shower pointed onto it."

My is focused on one breast mainly; I have no other symptoms of any kind going on there and my doctor checks it during my annual mammogram. All clear. The itch comes and go a bit and it also moves around from armpit to nipple. I've tried Evening Primrose Oil but it's only marginally helpful. I also put Bio-oil on after showering. I'm not on HRT (yet!). Anyone got any solutions?! It drives me MAD.

shan28265,2021-02-25T16:04+00:00,Left arm and chest pain,Wondering if anybody else gets the left arm and chest pain? I've seen two different cardiologists that ran some tests and then pretty much dismissed me saying they have never heard of this as it seemed to correlate with my cycle. It used to be much worse during my period and about 7 or 8 days after. I'm almost 48 now and I seem to have it more often. I was wondering if anybody else gets this and if they have been told what causes it when your heart checks out ok. It's really hard to not think heart problem when your chest hurts and it radiates down your arm . This and the anxiety are my two worst symptoms (along with the 66 others!!).

I have always had Migraines during my period but lately they have become way more severe and I've also started to have tension type headaches as well with a lot of head pressure/tingling (pressure in temples, around eyes, and cheeks) I've had scans done on my head and sinuses look fine, all scans are normal. I've also had times of lightheadedness and weakness in arms/legs. My heart checks out fine, my blood work is always fine. I feel like my GP will not consider peri because of my age and my OB isn't convinced either because my hormone bloodwork showed normal range when it was checked. Also, my periods have lighten significantly over the past 4-6 months. Could I be going through peri at 32? How can I convince my OB to take me seriously? Has anyone found anything to help the crazy head pressure feeling? Thanks so much for the feedback!!"

Periods were failry regular, though insanely painful and heavy my entire life because of cysts and fibroids. In early 2020, I missed a couple of periods for the first time. Missed June, got one in July and then no more periods for 5 months. I have had 2 in a row, roughly 5 weeks apart. The 5 missed periods were chalked up by the nurse practitioner as perimenopause. Now they're back and I'm wondering if it's normal to miss so many and have them return. Anyone else miss several periods only to have them start back up?"

These symptoms seem to come and go and I can feel better for a few weeks and then they come crashing back. Covid struck in early January and that seemed to trigger my symptoms again. It was hugely scary. I’m on HRT already - have tried oestrogel and utrogestan but it didn’t work for me, so back on combined tablets. I’m on week 4 of my first pack and am experiencing a bleed, which has also restarted my nausea and wobbly feelings again. l am also taking sertraline but it’s not alleviating my anxiety (I’m a long time worrier, have health anxiety and am a terrible overthinker). I also take vitamin D, B12, evening primrose and starflower oil, CBD oil& magnesium. Has anyone else experienced similar? Do I dare to hope that I will ever feel like me again?"

I was diagnosed with premature ovarian failure when I was 31. I had two beautiful children through IVF and then one surprise after naturally! I am now 39 and am having extremely weird symptoms. The last few months I have started to have more and more issues with bloating. Then the last two months I started spotting brown from ovulation to my period. The cycle I am currently in my period was heavy (as they have always been since they started) and it has now been going on for 8 days (pinkish/dark red light flow now). I have also started other symptoms: low back ache that migrates to upper and sometimes my buttock, some weird shooting vaginal pains almost like they were at my cervix, vaginal burning, some mild nausea, moodiness and irritability, leg pains, sometimes it feels like I can feel my bladder full when its not, weird twinges (sorta like cramps but not that strong). If I didn't just have my period I would likely go get a pregnancy test! Due to my diagnoses at 31 I assume I will go through menopause early??? but I am not sure. I have an ultrasound scheduled for Friday and a physical scheduled for next Wednesday, but the spotting, back pain and other symptoms are driving me out of my mind. My doctor didn't seem worried, but I am a worrier. If anyone has any experience or wisdom to share I would be happy to hear it! Thank you for reading. Jade"

Well it continued and I started needing to wee more. Went to the docs as thought could be vaginal atrophy, I had an internal, had bloods, water sample dipped and sent off. Came back that I'd got thrush, but everything else was all clear bloods and water sample all clear. Since then it's changed, I used the canesten pessary and cream but don't know if it's worked as it took forever to dissolve! Now I'm getting weird cramp like feelings again, I had these the week my bits felt funny too but not as bad. It's like period cramps ovary ache and low back ache with bloated feeling, exactly like I'd get if was getting or having a period. But nothing has shown up. My last period was on Xmas day, I'd had 2 that month. I'm also getting lots of other symptoms Headaches, flushes, lack of appetite, facial aches, muscle pain and aches, sense of smell increased, dizziness, bone aches, fatigue, lack of motivation, wind and tingly feelings. Has anyone else had anything like this? The docs think it's just the lack of hormones for a proper period and that's why I'm getting the cramps. Just fed up of feeling yucky."

I have to put on layers of clothing, and my thermostat is always on a comfortable 76 degrees. Most days when I experience the COLD FLASHES, I'm usually sitting next to a heater, fully-dressed-with a hat on my head and a scarf around my neck! WTH!!!

I didn't fully understand what she meant,(because of course i am freaking out) but they need to check an area on each breast further I do not think they saw anything specific, but it looked different from my last years test I personally do not feel anything (i know that doesnt mean much) Needless to say I am a wreck I am very worried Any comments or help would be aprreciated Thank you!"

I am wondering if things really get better over time? I see a lot of stories on here where people are just as bad post-menopause. This has pretty much ruined my life. I am almost always at home because I feel so sick. I literally don't remember what it feels like to feel good.I quit driving because of the dizziness and drunk feelings. This all started when my daughter was 9. It's been so long she doesn't even remember a time when her mom hasn't been sick. Doctor's are completely clueless. I had doctor after doctor tell me everything is in my head. Funny they would think that I went 40+ years with no medical problems to just start making up problems for the fun of it in my 40s. Starting to lose hope that things will improve over time, because for me things have just gotten worse over time."

mad_cat_lady,2021-02-08T17:19+00:00,Endometriosis diagnosed aged 65!,"Brief history. 2019 , contracted sepsis following a steroid injection in Rt knee. As I was being prepared for theatre to flush the joint I needed the loo. Passed large clots and this continued after the op for around a week. Referred for Ultrasound and hysteroscopy. Polyps and cell samples removed, all came back clear. Christmas Eve 2020, the bleeding started again and continues to do so to date. Had the Ultrasound and hysteroscopy 05/02 . Consultant who did the procedure advised there was thickening to the lining of my womb and ""It does not look normal"". Whereas the last time, different Consultant said immediately after the hysteroscopy that after scraping down into the fresh cells, things looked ok. Obviously neither could say for definite, until they got/get the lab results. I'm now in limbo until the second set of results come back - hopefully within 2 weeks. The Consultant this time prescribed Provera 5mg x 2 daily to ease the bleeding. Has anyone else with postmenopausal bleeding at my age experienced anything similar? Have you been prescribed Provera and how did you find it? Did you experience any of the side effects mentioned on the info leaflet? I sailed through the menopause aged 45 - 47 and have had no problems what so ever, until the sepsis incident and can't help wondering if there's a connection. TIA"

About 6 months ago i started experiencing the most horrible and strange symptoms! i was diagnosed with suspected lymes disease as i had a rash that looked like a rash you get from a tick bite and i found a tick on my daughter about a week before i really noticed my symptoms! however looking back i think i may have been experiencing some in the summer! night sweats and excessive tiredness and irritability i experienced before finding the tick! then since then ive had every symptom on the list of 66 nearly! my hormone test also confirmed i have low oestradiol/oestrogen! my symptoms have consisted of heart palpations, shortness of breath, very tired, very angry, very emotional, lighter periods, muscle spasms, tingling, numbness, joint and bone pain, weight loss, head aches, burning mouth syndrome, more sweaty than usual, loss of strength, excessive burping the lost goes on. i also have some swollen lymph nodes in groin but ive had them scanned 3 times by ultrasound and had ct scan and mri and they say they are barely swollen and benign. ive had a brain mri to look for any issues there but came back clear. ive been to a and e a number of times had 2 ecg all normal and had so many blood tests and the doctors arent concerned about any of the blood tests. other than my oestrogen levels but i have to have these levels repeated along with progesterone and testosterone in a few weeks. they said they cant refer me to endocrinologist or give me anything for it until the repeat blood test! im in living hell right now! i had a full blown panic attack the other night that woke me up from my sleep! I thought i was having a heart attack. since then ive had constant weird ache in my left side of neck and shoulder sometimes in arm and upper back and heart palpatations on and off. do these all seem like common symptoms or should i be pushing doctors to investigate further in other areas. or is it a given this is going to happen to me at a similar age to my mother and il be experiencing these symptoms potentially for the next 6 years or even up to 10 ive heard they can last! any advice or moral support would be amazing! i already have 2 kids and a step daughter so im not really plannng on having more kids so early menopause isnt a terrible thing i suppose. my dad also has a heart condition called atrial fibrilation that causes palpitations - so im also worrying i may be at risk for this. and ive read that low eostrogen can impact heart health. just very worried and confused about my health at the moment!!!"

laura21869,2021-01-29T18:06+00:00,Am Really Struggling with Menopause,"I started menopausal symptoms at about 47 but it has gotten particularly bad this past year. I am 53. I stopped having my period about a year ago. The worst thing are the hot flashes. I have them for about a full 1/3 of the day. Worse in the morning. Anybody who knows knows how terrible these are. I sweat constantly, and it feels like a panic attack, especially when I'm talking to somebody face to face. I cannot wear any clothes, literally. It is winter here and I basically wear tank tops, skirts and flip flops to work with a cardigan pulled over it because I am so damn hot all of the time. Wearing something like winter boots makes me so hot and sweaty I want to scream. Not very conducive to my climate here, where we had a blizzard two days ago. I run a fan on myself 24/7. I was taking HRT - it doesn't do anything. Lose weight? Yeah, great, I had arthroscopic surgery 10 days ago, so getting back to exercise is going to be a process. I put on a full 35-40 pounds in the last four years due to menopause and mood stabilizer medicine I was on. OMG - I have never been so gigantic in my life - not even when full term pregnant. And - losing weight at 53 is one of the hardest things I've ever done. I barely eat. I am in a constant rage - at the world, at traffic, at my boss, at my partner - constantly. I can't tone it down. I break things sometimes. Yeah, yeah, I have psychiatric medication, (it's all weight-causing) I have a therapist, I feel like I'm losing my mind. My therapist is a man. My partner is a man. My mother had a hysterectomy at 30 and knows nothing about menopause. She thinks it's funny, actually. Most of my friends are a little younger than me, or haven't experienced it to this degree. There is nothing funny about this. The other problem I have with it is psychologically, both in how my appearance has changed, and how people treat you. I have always been considered attractive, it is part of my identity. Now I feel like I look - what - middle-aged? like somebody's mother? So it's really hard to get used to this fat frumpy self where I cant get into any clothes and refuse to buy a size big enough to fit me. But worse, I think, is how society starts to dismiss you. The thing is, people are scared to death of youth diminishing, and they hate to see it in their face. They think they can be dismissive of you or treat you badly because of it. That p*sses me off because I will not be dismissed and do not tolerate it - so it makes me more loud, and sometimes obnoxious. I will not be dismissed by anyone. I'm in a conundrum, because personally I feel more confident and sure of myself than ever before, yet I'm in a body/face where people don't take me seriously anymore(?) I'm not a people pleaser anymore, which after 50 years feels so good I can't express it enough. Yet society wants to shut me down, not listen to me - put me in my place. Ha - hilarious. I could try to validate myself by sleeping with a younger guy, no problem - but the validation is not there, more trouble than it's worth. So, as I said - people do not understand menopause, I'm in hell and I don't know when it's going to stop. I don't really believe natural remedies work. Nobody in my circle understands. So therefore I am here. Thanks."
nsmith19,2021-01-29T15:44+00:00,Diagnosed with complex endometrial hyperplasia with atypia. What should I do?,"Hi, In late 2012, I noticed I was having a lot of cramping and heaviness. I went to multiple doctors because test were done and nothing would be found. I went to a new gynecologist and he decided to preform an endometrial laparoscopy. Some endometriosis was found but when they sent some samples to the pathologist, complex hyperplasia with atypia was found. I was only 24 at the time. The doctor told me that being diagnosed that young and the most aggressive hyperplasia was rare. The most common treatment is a hysterectomy, but I hadn't and still haven't had any kids, so we decided to go into a chemical menopause with Lupron depot. I was in this menopause for a year. I was also on progesterone. The next two biopsies came back clear. I was told as long as I had a uterus, I would need to be on progesterone and having biopsies every 6 months to make sure it hasn't come back. However in 2016, I lost my health insurance so I couldn't keep up with my treatment. I also moved about 6 hours away from the gynecologist who had diagnosed me. I was also younger and a bit naive, so I didn't have it checked out until last year. I explained to my new gynecologist my history and he didn't seem to believe me. I was able to convince him to do a biopsy, which he reluctantly agreed to. Nothing was found, and he didn't prescribe progesterone. Well fast forward to December and I started with excessive cramping and heaviness again. I've always been irregular in my menstruation, this time around I haven't had a period in about 15 months. I also raised my concern about my irregular periods when I went in for the biopsy, but the gynecologist said not to worry to much about it since it was normal for me. I wanted to be give Provera to make my period come, but he said no. (I know, I should've looked for a new doctor at that point, but he came highly recommended by a good friend.) I am now afraid that there is something wrong, since I have all the symptoms I had before the diagnosis. I scheduled an appointment with a new gynecologist since December, but the first appointment I was able to find is in late February and that was calling around to every gynecologist I could. Has anyone been diagnosed with complex hyperplasia with atypia and if so has it come back? I am beyond worried about all this, and it doesn't help that I work myself up more. Thank you for reading and any advise would be appreciated. Nelly"

Nour77713,2021-01-28T14:06+00:00,Cutting out dairy made my periods /endometriosis worse,"My periods have been extremely bad since I first started , I have horrible periods cramps , I have back pain, my legs and arms go numb and I am always throwing up , i literally cant walk around for 3 days so i have to be in my bed or i will either faint or be sick. I also suffer from ibs , sometimes because of throwing up so much I have to have an iv because I get so dehydrated, so I decided that I am going to do something about this so I thought i will cut out dairy , I did it for a month and thought my period would improve but when they came they was the worst I’ve had in years , I was sick for 3 whole days usually it’s only one day, I had the worst cramps , I thought it would help my diet so I’m not sure what happened, I was thinking because I was drinking almond milk that could be why because nuts are a trigger for my ibs but I’m just not sure. Also another thing , I tried blackstrap molasses which may be a reason why it got worse but I did that a month before and it didn’t make me worse and infact I thought it helped a little so I doubt it but I do know it’s not good for Ibs. I have not been diagnosed with endometriosis as I am not comfortable with the Way they diagnose you as I am young and I don’t want to do it.Do you think because I cut dairy out and it didn’t work would that possible mean I may not have endometriosis. Sorry this is all over the place but what are your thoughts ."

I had the most crazy anxiety as one thing after another started happening to my body - pain, bloat, couldn't breathe etc. I was so sure I was going to die and the worse was when I adopted Google as my friend and started looking up every symptom. Fast forward to now and I'm post menopause (if there is such a thing) and my body feels as if I am being put in a washing machine. It started with neck tightness. When that got better, it moved to my shoulder, then arm. When that got better it moved lower and lower. Now my tummy feels strange, my back aches on and off and my knee hurts. Oh, and that feeling that my heart is beating fast (even when it is not), chest discomfort etc. Occasional pop of anxiety and random thoughts. I really hope this transits to a more normal state where all the aches and pains disappear. For now, I just pray every day that things will get better. I"

stacybeok,2021-01-07T21:34+00:00,I need answers feel like slowly dieing,"I am looking to see if others have my extensive history of not feeling good and with premedo its worse!! Ill give a quick run down of my history and who I am, Im 44 years old 2 kids 16&12. when i was around 12 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism it had shut down, and from that moment have been on various levels of levythroxine. Around the same time I was diagnosed with lactose intolerance also. It doesnt stop there, I have always felt ""off"" little uneasy when stressed or new things in my life and stomach sickness a lot. In my early 20s started taking zoloft ( sertraline) for anxiety. Still on it to this day, only times I quit was when I was pregnant. I hated being pregnant felt off and just awful the whole time with both kids. Fast forward to when I was 33 had my tubes clamped (because i was never able to take birth control, side effects where worse than not taking any) My periods started being off, my stomach up set got worse, headacks, anxiety just started falling apart. Over the years menstrual cycles came and went when ever or just kept on. In 2014 it was bad enough I had a specialist burn inside of my uterus to prevent bleeding it should of lasted up to 5 years but within 2 months I had bleeding again. Dr. okayed my for partial hysterectomy. After that I still continued to feel off, but I could deal. Then in 2018 I started to have ""thinning"" of my labia. Dr. visit after visit no answers it was awful! Pain and burn even tearing and cracking. I found an ob in 2019 that prescribed cream which helped but still had flare ups. Shortly after I was also diagnosed with Celiac's. I started feeling better and issues I was having with guts, and vagina seemed to get better. But that was short lived.... I became feel off, panicky, heart racing, dizzy, anxiety, you name it. Drs yes a few because I wasnt feeling like anyone was listening to me. Dr after dr blood tests play with levels of my thyroid meds but no help even made worse at some points. Finally a dr ran hormones test and said you are premedo. I was excited for a second I finally was getting answers! Well that was short lived... I continued to feel ""flu"" like or I'm dieing a slow death and no one will hear me. I seen ob who prescribed premairin 1s week I felt AMAZING the best I felt my entire 44 years!!! Once again that was short lived, the 2nd week I thought I had stomach blockage the pain. Also dizzy felt faint couldnt drive was afraid to be alone, didnt know what was going to happen! I missed a full month of work didnt leave my home for 3 weeks other than to go to ER or Dr. just to have them tell me blood work looks ok except for my tsh went from 3.75 to 16.50. I quit taking Premairin and slowly started feeling not so dead. I just need to know im not alone, i cant be the only 1 with these issues. Any help or any anything is welcome I just want to feel great and have my life back!!"

lesley55485,2021-01-21T20:12+00:00,Odd pressure tingling feeling in bottom and bits.,"So over the last 3 or 4 months my cycles have been odd. I was on HRT and bcp but had to come off them. So now I'm not on anything other than Menopace and vit d, epo and b complex supplements. The last 2 months I had very short cycles with only 20 days between. This month I was expecting the same but as yet I'm 3 days later than I have been the last 2. Ive noticed that over the last 6 months or so I've developed some weird tingling. First it was hands and legs. That comes and goes now, but this last 2 months I've developed it as a weird like tingly feeling in my vagina, it's like it suddenly starts to tingle and it makes my bottom half feel all odd. It lasts about 2 minutes maximum. Then goes away, it can happen once a day or 3 or 4 times a day, it was initially I thought related to certain points in my cycle but now I'm not so sure. I've also started this week with a weird pressure feeling in my bottom, like a heavy feeling. I don't have any issues with my bowels, no piles or bleeding. Just wondered if anyone else has anything like this? I'm guessing the odd period dates are all part and parcel, and am sort of hoping the tingly bits may well be the hormones dipping, flaring whatever they're doing. Sorry for the long ramble, just don't know what else to think."

Guest,2020-07-30T15:59+00:00,I tried the antidepressant but.....,"For the past 2 weeks i have tried an antidepressant at a very low dose of 12.5mg to see if it would help my menopause symptoms....the side effects of nausea, acid reflux and exhaustion were awful but i was determined to stick with it. But well into the second week i took my morning pill and all hell broke loose!! I became very very nauseated with a constant gagging feeling, very dizzy, very dark & depressed, my mouth was numb feeling with an intense taste of a pill (i swallowed the pill whole but it tasted like i chewed it up), seen weird white orbs and my head felt fuzzy.....like i was moving in slow motion. These symptoms lasted the whole day, but when i woke up the next morning those side effects were still there only more intense! Needless to say i didnt take my morning dose and for 2 more days those side effects lingered, including the horrible pill taste in my mouth.... i felt as though i had been poisoned!! I was scared that i may have broken something in my brain! Well im finally starting to feel a little better and those side effects are finally lessening. I can honestly say antidepressants wont help in my fight with menopause, it made it so much worse and i felt like i was literally dying! What are we supposed to do to get through this hell when treatments are worse than the condition itself!?"

I went through a pretty nerve wracking event this week and latley i have been feeling more anxious than normal. I keep getting this feeling in my head the best way to discribe it is like a pulsating or thumping sensation only last a few seconds a few times a day. I do have issues with my neck but didnt think the 2 went together. I have been on Dr Google bad idea and now im thinking could this be blood pressure related? Ive always been on the low side I am 41 am a normal weight dont drink or smoke. However ive also read this could be caused from anxiety sometimes i can feel it in my chest two like my heart pounds for a few seconds then is normal. So my question is any ladies with high blood pressure did you have any symptoms prior to finding out. Could this be stressed induced? I will be seeing my doctor to have my pressure checked just looking for some reassurance advice kind words. This journey has been taking a toll on me. Thanks Everyone in advance

I'm 53 and at the best of times quite poorly and in a lot of pain with fybromyalgia, I cant walk far and my health has failed looking after my daughter who has ASD/ADHD and with fighting to get her needs met in school and just getting by and coping by the skin of my teeth. She now has specialist provision and is doing really well in school and is happy. 8 years ago I had an ablation to fix heavy periods. The ablation has now failed and I'm bleeding extremely heavily and continually ... Its literally like bleed outs and its not a pleasant odour either... Ive tried to get health care but due to the pandemic I can't get help unless I'm literally at deaths door. I've previously been diagnosed with endometrial hyperlasia when the gyni took a womb lining sample... and I've been told that progesterone is my only treatment option which I'm not prepared to take because at the best of times my mental health is fragile and I don't want to have the mood swings as I need the patience of a Saint for my daughter... I've never coped well with hormone treatments! My questions are ... ... As I won't take progesterone will the bleeding ever stop by itself? and ...can a womb that is so scarred up by a failed ablation reasonably and reliably be sampled and checked for cancer? Thanks in advance Melanie"

I also had a stage of intermittently bleeding for approx 6 weeks, so I was also referred me for a scan (came back fine). Having been off the pill for almost a year now, I haven’t had a period, still really struggling with my weight, and find I’m very irritable! Suffering with vaginal dryness/pain during sex.

My period stopped about 12 months ago and I had my hormones tested last month. I am 47 and the gynecologist said that there was no way I was in menopause yet, he claimed I was to young. Well, tests came back and my numbers indicate I am Post-Menopausal. I had almost no estradiol/estrogen. I developed a literal right hand tremor about 6 months ago (dominant hand). I was sent to a neurologist and he diagnosed it as ""Essential Tremor"". I asked my gynecologist and the neurologist if it could be related to my hormones, being I have nearly no estrogen in my body. Both said they weren't sure. The tremor is mild and gets worse with stress. Has anyone had this happen to them around the time of your menopause?"

suzie70,2017-04-05T18:44+00:00,"Scary symptoms, anyone else?","All of a sudden I am experiencing really scary symptoms. I was wondering if they are the same as anyone else? . What is really concerning to me are the recent feelings I have had over the past several days. I had feelings similar to anxiety. This past weekend I felt not quite right with weakness in my arms. I thought perhaps I was dehydrated and too much caffeine.(No caffeine since.) I also felt like I could not take a deep enough breathe. And when I tried to sleep I felt an overwheming feeling of doom and jolted awake a few times as I drifted off to sleep. Since then, over the last few days I have felt weakness in my arms and a kind of warmth or heat. I also felt the tingling sensation like they had fallen asleep. I wouldn't describe the feeling in my chest as ""pains"", but I just feel ""aware"" of my chest and heart beat, if that makes sense? It's really scary! It feels like my heart is beating very strongly and sometimes more quickly. It made me think that I might be having a heart attack. Then of course, I get anxious and feel panicked. The feeling eventually subsides but it has come back and more intensely this morning. I've read thru this forum and found that other women talk about feeling like they are dying or ending up in the ER because they thought it was a heart attack. Is this similar to aynone's experience? I wasn't really concerned with my initial symptons that seem to relate to perimenopause. I'm 47, have not missed a period yet, just slightly irregular. I have had night sweats for several years fairly steady then on and off. Have some slight depression, weight gain, feeling of bloating and irritability. An occassional feeling of anxiety. I used to be a great sleeper but over the past year find that I can't always fall or stay asleep. I just haven't felt quite like myself and feel rather lethargic and foggy. My libido has dropped also. I am petrified of these new symptons and also afraid of doctors. ?Thanks for listening"

It has been over a year since my last period.

My issue with the discharge is not only unpleasant, uncomfortable & messy, but causes irritation and itchy rash. I apologize for this nasty visual, LOL.

c14889,2020-11-09T13:07+00:00,"Blurred vision (cloudy eyes), tingling in my right shoulder, and restless legs","Y'all this is CRAZY! I'm 42 and have had a REALLY hard past three years. It does seem to be getting a little better, but I just wanted to ask about three really weird symptoms that I have been having. Sometimes (usually accompanied with anxiety or a low mood) my vision gets blurry and my eyes appear almost jaundice and cloudy. I am a non-drinker, work out and a pretty good eater. Anyone out there have this? I also have tingling (in my forehead, face and in my back right shoulder) and restless legs at night. I'm very curious about the eyes though. I've has this for a few years now and would be interested to know if anyone out there is experiencing the same. I know I don't personally know any of you, but I wish I could give you all a BIG hug and thank you SO much for your love and support on this site. It has been a HUGE help for me!"

It is just so hard for me to understand how I can feel so well one minute, and even have a string of great weeks, only to descend back into the perimenopausal abyss. I am now 50 days without a period, and I am 52 years old, so I am holding onto this as a positive, knowing that I am moving in the right direction. But why does this have to be so hard?! Can anyone else relate? Please share:)"
clair11942,2020-12-26T14:36+00:00,Does taking the pill help?,"Because my doctor refuses to help with perimenopause, I don't think they have even heard of it, because they keep saying ""your too young for menopause and your still having periods"", When I mention perimenopause they change the subject, I've always had my period every month same time, now I will have 2 a month then nothing for 7 weeks etc, The doctor did hormone tests but as we all know they would need to take a blood test everyday for 2 months to see how our hormones are, so they were normal expect my pituitary gland she said I had a ""Microprolactinoma"", All they have given me is ""Cerelle"" 75mcg I've never been on any contraceptive pill since I was young, I woke this morning with period pains (stomach cramps like I usually would get when my period arrives) and tender breasts (again I haven't suffered with tender breasts since I was 15 years old) they are so tender it's painful, My last period was only 6 days ago, Has anyone else been prescribed the pill and found it helpful, (the nurse said it wouldnt cause weight gain, my biggest worry as I can't shift the weight I've gained I'm 196 lbs! Xmas day was ruined because I had nausea all day, couldn't eat Xmas Dinner my dad spent ages preparing, and my mother is termilly ill I wanted to make our last Xmas as best I could and ended up ruining it, I even looked into seeing a private doctor but I seen the prices and I'm not working at the moment so I'm stuck, Just thought I'd ask if people did or didnt find the pill helpful so I can make a decision, I know I've only been on it 2 weeks but I don't notice a mass difference Thanks ladies in advance, its relieving to hear that I'm not alone x"

clair11942,2020-12-24T03:23+00:00,I'm so sick and tired of Doctor saying too young,"After doing tons of research online, and then going from having normal period every single month to, 2 in one month then nothing for 7 weeks and then bleed again, I'm still bleeding very very lightly and it's been 8 days, For the last 2 years I started having panic attacks (out of the blue), horrific and always early hours in the morning, thinking i was having heart attack, Hair loss, weight gain, major fatigue, brain fog, loss of libido (for me sex is like blades it's hurts and I've no interest in it, my partner is getting fed up) I was sick of back n forth to the doctors, But since my periods have been all over the place, I've gone downhill fast, Oral thrush 3 times, 2 seperate times having vaginal swabs and came back yeast /bacteria infection and given thrush treatment, (even though no symptoms of vaginal thrush), No follow up check ups Blood tests came back, doctor rang me and said ""your hormone levels are fine however I think you have a brain tumour it's not cancerous and we will do blood test in 2 months, she said it was"" microplactoma "", Then I read if your perimenopause that the hormones fluctuate so much it would take a blood test every day for 3 months to check them, I've kept onto them and they are not having any of it"" your too young your 43"" I've started suffering terrible insomnia I've never had before, When I had rage the other day and felt like smashing my house up the doctor said on the phone when I rang to go see the nurse as I'll prescribe you the mini pill that will help with your PMS, I sat and cried with the nurse, but she did my blood pressure and pulse and went and got the doctor, The doctor said ""you need to calm yourself down your blood pressure is high and your pulse is 130 if u don't calm down it can cause a heart attack, I told her I didn't feel rage just annoyed about not feeling well and been in my bed for weeks no motivation, Then I noticed when walking upstairs that my knees were making a squelching noise, and now I'm at the point when I bend my knee it sounds like someone walking over broken glass it's awful and painful and I've lost 2 inches in height, Again rang the doctor today about it and guess... Prescription for cocodamols, saying he can't give me anti inflammatory as I have a hiatus hernia which I'm awaiting surgery for, I'm worried now I might have oestraprosis, I'm sure I read somewhere that if perimenopause isn't treated It can lead to it, So I've bought a load of vitamin supplements hoping for a few days to feel normal, I've also developed a lump in my thumb by the joint which is getting bigger, I feel like a hypochondriac, but I just wish I'd get this magic pill from the doctor and they knew what was going on with me, There just looking at each symptom on its own instead of adding everything up, I'm so low as I've never conceived a child and I can't believe I won't be a mother, my partner is 16 years younger and has put up with so much from me, We been together 8 years and he wants a child, well he is missing having sexual contact with me, I don't even want hugs from him and I feel bad, Sorry this is so long everyone just wanted to give the whole picture"

Mizmelzy76,2020-12-22T14:55+00:00,Supplements to relieve hot flashes?,"I have started this year getting hot flashes I am 45 years old. They are not terribly bad just annoying at night. I don't sleep well because of them. I keep waking up hot so I uncover, then maybe 30 minutes later am freezing so I have to cover back up. This goes on all night. I've tried wearing light clothing at night but that still doesn't help. And then I am freezing most of the night not wearing enough. Usually ( I live in Wisconsin) I am cold all the time so I can wear multiple layers of clothing to keep warm. So I have gone back to just wearing normal pajamas at night. But my sleep is very disturbed by waking up on and off all night. My Fitbit said last night I was awake for 2 hours. I believe it. Normally I may be awake 30 mins. And it's getting annoying and I am tried. A little back story on me. I have had a hormonal balance all my life. In my 30's they tested my hormones and my estrogen was normal but my testosterone was borderline deficient. I was two points away from being low in testosterone. So they tried giving me a natural supplement that your body converts into testosterone. Only 1/2 the original dose and I was having horrible breakouts on my face so bad it hurt to talk. So then they tried progesterone and that didn't do anything. So we just left it at that since I really wasn't having any issues with it. She said it was the way my body was just made. Because usually being estrogen dominant has unpleasant side effects but I didn't have any. I was kind of hoping that this meant when I went into menopause I wouldn't have a hard time with it since I am dominant in it. I did some research on natural supplements. I do not want to take any hormones because both my parents died of cancer and one of my grand parents had it as well but didn't pass from it. I know taking any type of hormone can increase your risk. I don't want to add to it. So I am looking into natural supplements that may help. I've already tried Black Cohosh Root. Which I can only take 1 capsule a day other wise I get nauseated. Standard dose for what I bought is 1 capsule 3x daily. And just taking 1 isn't helping. Are there any other natural supplements that may help? My hot flashes are not terrible by any means. I just get a little hot and feel a little sweaty. But it's annoying when you just take a shower and 20 minutes later feel sweaty again So what other supplements have you taken that have helped? I will be going into my doctor for a well check soon and am asking for something to help me sleep through my hot flashes at night. I am already on benedryl for allergies, and melatonin (10mg) along with a muscle relaxer for my Fibro. Hoping they can give me something good. Basically, I want to sleep so well a tornado could sweep through my house and I will sleep through it lol Thanks in advance! Melissa"

jayneejay,2014-08-23T17:52+00:00,Estriol Vaginal Cream.. Menopause .. anyone tried it for Vaginal Dryness ?,"wondering if this is a moderately safer option... low dose... ? anyone use it etc... or similar ..  VAGINAL DRYNESS Lack of estrogen can cause dryness and thinning of the vaginal tissues making intercourse uncomfortable or even painful. The first sign of an effect of reduced estrogen on the vagina is reduced lubrication during sexual activity. HRT can alleviate this but even if you cannot take systemic HRT you may still be able to use estrogen topically to the vagina. This is available in a few forms; creams administered via applicators, waxy pessaries, small tablets inserted with an applicator or a vaginal ring which stays in place for 3 months at a time. For creams, pessaries or vaginal tablets, the initial dose is 1 application nightly for 2 weeks, followed by the maintenance dose of 1 application twice weekly. Low dose vaginal estrogen preparations can be used long term without causing any known systemic effect, and without needing any progestogenic protection of the lining of the womb. Even if you cannot or do not want to use hormones there are other options. Over the counter bio-adhesive vaginal moisturisers are very effective. A range of products are available, many of which are easier to use than KY jelly, which is water based and more slippery. These moisturizers are also slightly acidic which helps prevent vaginal infections. One other advantage is that they do not need to be used at the time of intercourse. Some women have found a Tea tree oil based product helpful. Several non-hormonal vaginal products can be also be prescribed and include Replens MD, Hyalofemme and Sylk. Please note: Patients should consult a health professional to decide on the appropriate treatment option to be prescribed. VAGINAL TREATMENTS Local estrogen can be used for vaginal and bladder symptoms, when systemic treatment is not desired or appropriate. For some women, vaginal estrogen may be required along with systemic HRT."

Soon after, I had my first migraine aura. I was symptom free until the last three months. I have had several instances of seeing stars after standing up. I recently had bloodwork done and all was normal. I haven't had my BP taken in a year and a half. It's always high at the doctors ever since the migraine aura landed me in the ER. Every time I had my BP taken in the 43 years prior, it was normal. I have since developed a fear of getting my BP taken which causes anxiety. I know it's irrational, but I can't help it. Anyone with a similar problem?"

Well I'm 46 and I'm suffering really horrible symptoms as I know all of you are. Looking back now I've probably been going through peri for about 3 years. Lately I honestly have thought I'm going mad. Symptoms have changed from just headaches and fatigue and slight anxiety. They are pressure headaches every day,weak legs (like jelly)I feel as if I'm not here in this world sometimes,horrible sadness and doom and gloom which comes on me in a flash. Panicy when I go certain places so I am always trying to stop panic attacks. Feeling hot and some nights hot sweats which I know is very common. I've lost interest in everything and don't want to go anywhere and that's not the real me. How do you deal with this ? Anyone on HRT ? If so does this help ? Thankyou."

Looking for reassurance. Im 43 been in peri for about 4 years now. And in all my life even after my children never had a period this long. I am not flooding and its not extremely heavy just crazy.

Never bled after that. Ran to the shop and bought two more test kits which showed another very very faint positive line then I decided to buy a digital one which said not pregnant.

I've also had to pay many visits to the physio to help with strains and muscle problems., in fact amongst my friends it's a bit of a joke how easily I get injured.

I've developed neck pain that makes my neck, shoulder, armpit and collar bone ache. It also hurts in my jaw that side. This has all come about after being home having to rest these last 2 months. I've spent a lot of time either in bed or propped on the sofa so I know it's probably to do with poor posture too. I've also been very stressed about the illness side of things and have found the days I'm stressing it hurts more. What I have figured out is the day before a period shows up the neck pain and aches are a lot worse, they ease slightly during the period. I'm wondering if this is all hormones at play again? Have spoke to my doctor and she feels it's posture and stress related. My neck cracks and creaks a lot too. I'm 46 and about 4 or so years into perimenopause. Had to come off HRT and BC in October due to them causing very high blood pressure which caused a bleed behind my eye. What does everyone do for the neck and shoulder pains?"
Shaunap2020,2020-12-08T01:08+00:00,How can the medical community not be helping us more?!,"Im 47 and I am miserable right now as i type this. I've had a partial hysterectomy (8 yrs ago) then had to have my fallopian tubes removed two yrs ago, due to them swelling with fluid. I would say looking back I started peri 5 yrs ago but hit the symptoms hard after the tube surgery. Every month it is progressively getting worse. I also have hashimoto and this meno experience has really whacked my thyroid out so that doesnt help things. I've had EBV reactivate this year and I am so sick of being sick. So is my family. I've gone to several specialists, as the symptoms came on so fierce and quickly that i seriously thought/think something else is wrong. Here enters severe health anxiety. Every few weeks its a new scary symptom that Ive never experienced in my life. In addition to hot flashes and night sweats, Ive had migraines for two months straight, aches so painful in legs, heart palpitations, racing heart, anxiety, GI issues, itchy skin, burning tongue, gum issues, massive inflammation everywhere, dry eyes, and although i gained weight during peri, im now underweight even though im forcing myself to eat 2500 calories a day. i cannot gain weight. I've lost all muscle and i am doing strength training daily to build it up again. Asthma like feeling, coughing up phlegm, sore throat, sinus issues, tingling in arms and legs.... Like every symptom possible. i've had x-rays, ct scans, mri's, ekgs, heart monitor, and loads of blood work and two trips to ER. a few dozen dr appts..... Nothing is wrong, heres some anxiety meds and antidepressants. Seriously, i have a hormone problem! Dr said he doesn't think i need hormones because its better to go through it naturally if you can. Heres a referral to a mental health clinic. I read all of your posts and the medical community is making a ton of money on us. Yes we go to ER and ask for imaging etc, but I for one didnt know what to expect or even what was going on when it started..... I just knew I was not right and something was/is wrong. I am so glad for the internet to help us ladies bridge this gap and share our experiences. Dr has told me many times ""thats not a meno symptom""..... ummmm it is. Why isnt there more training for drs in this to help us. Yes it prob becomes a mental issue, only when we've been written off and are made to feel like a hypochondriac by the medical world. If I didnt have this forum I would swear that I had several diseases, all at the same time. I keep telling myself to hang in there , that it wont always be like this but I literally cry everyday because i feel so crappy. How long can i feel like I have the flu before my body breaks down, or my stress is too much. Thanks for reading ladies, I guess I just needed to vent because my poor hubby has heard enough over the years. I meditate every day, take cbd oil, and i have also tried a couple functional medicine drs which made me feel worse and i was sold $500 worth of supplements a month to take.... who can do that?!?! I feel like Ive done everything I can. Hubby says I have to just accept where I am but I am so fearful that it wont get better and I'll be feeling this way for the rest of my life. I find hope in that I will be a beautiful butterfly when I am done with this transition. I am both glad and sorry that Im not alone in this. Tomorrow will be a better day! Hugs to you all."

Like many of you, I've been to the dr more in these last few years then my whole life combined. I've had heart monitors, ekg's, various imaging and loads of blood work. i basically know what i dont have. Please, can any of you share if this gets better? I need something to hold on to. i had a partial hysterectomy several years ago so i cant go off my periods and have no idea where i am in this process. Drs have drawn fsh and it shows post but i have learned this is very unreliable and honestly i feel i am deep in the end of peri at best. Please tell me the symptoms ease..... I have them all!"
Gigi368,2020-12-03T06:43+00:00,Feel like I've checked out of life....,"Hello Lovelies, It's been a while since I've complained lol I was just getting to a point where I thought I was handling all these stupid symptoms that pop up. I have the vaginal atrophy under control and was dealing fairly well with the hot flashes and dizziness. I suffer from anxiety and panic disorder along with having tachycardia, heart valve issues and high blood pressure, I was learning what was meno and what wasn't. Fast forward to this past July, went to the eye doc and several days later ended up with a nasty swollen eye, under the eye where you'd get eye bags, it swelled up and looked like a giant red worm, off to urgent care I went, they said it was periorbital cellulitis put me on antibiotics and an eye drop.. it took a couple weeks but it went away. I then started having an issue with a tooth and needed a root canal, well.. on the Xray it showed a cyst, so off to a specialist I went, he then sent me to yet another specialist, I had a cone laser scan done and it showed that I have an issue with my nasopalatine duct, which is in the roof of your mouth behind your front teeth, it wasn't clear exactly what's going on so the scan is being sent to a University to be read by another specialist. I'm waiting on those results. In the meantime my eyes have totally changed shape, my left eye is bigger than my right and kind of bulges, the right eye is slightly sunk in and smaller and the upper lid stays swollen. They both burn and feel gritty and extremely heavy. Two days ago I started getting phantom smells like crazy glue or a chemical smell, I know it's not in my house because I can smell it when I'm not home, and my sinuses are on fire, and feel full but nothing comes out when I blow my nose. Add in the mouth issues I've been having for over a year, the doc told me it was thrush at first, I was on 3 different meds over a period of a month, nothing worked, still have the bad taste, thick saliva, and burning/tingling. At my dental appointment he went thru it with a fine tooth comb and deemed my gums and teeth in good condition and no sign of oral cancer. So add all this to my meno symptoms and I'm convinced I have something seriously wrong but my doc is a moron and doesn't listen, just wants to throw a pill at it and not find the cause. I know the thyroid can cause a lot of issues and upon looking up symptoms, which is stupid, I found a lot of my symptoms can be associated with the thyroid. And of course brain tumor popped up and now my brain is fixated on that. I have no energy at all, all I want to do is sleep. Zero appetite, I've lost 5 lbs in just a few days and when I do eat it just runs right thru me. I am totally a shell of the person I was prior to July. With this stupid virus I can't go see friends, whom most aren't even in peri yet. I lost my mom a year and a half ago, so I can't talk to her. I feel totally LOST and alone. Has anyone had any of this stuff happen? I'm calling my doc tomorrow but I'm not hopeful he'll be any help and I have to have a referral to see any specialists and he's a selfish little man who doesn't like to give them. I'd change doc's but it's not so easy when you're on Medicare (I'm in the U.S.). Sorry for the long rant! I just can't take it any more."
tebrown96,2020-12-04T13:56+00:00,Morning-sickness-like symptoms?,"I am 46, been in peri for 3 years, and have pretty much experienced all the crazy symptoms. The latest seems to be morning-sickness-like feelings in the morning. It's not awful, but I have slight queasiness upon waking (esp. when I wake early), but the worst is that brushing my teeth in the morning triggers my gag reflux. I can barely brush for 30 seconds before I start gagging. Never to the point of actually getting sick, and once I gag a few times, I'm good to go for the rest of the day. No more queasiness or gagging, and I have no trouble brushing at night (or even later in the day). I equate this to the same hormonal issues as you go through during pregnancy, but just wanted to see if others suffer from this annoying peri symptom."

Two weeks went by and Im sorry Tmi but was using the bathroom and was a little constipated started to spot again and thought this is the start to my November period. That lasted about 4 days and again extremely light but more than spotting if that makes sense. Then on Monday I had hanky panky lol with the hubby next day i started to bleed very lightly. This has been going on for 3 days now and again extremely light. I have made an appointment but they can not see me until December 28th!!! Does this sound familiar to anyone. Normally my breast usually left gets incredibly tender before my period I havent had that. At this point Im scared of the big C word.

Ive been having a few hot spells recently and my sleep has been awful. i have also become very anxious. I requested a blood test from my GP to see if perhaps oestrogen was falling. He phoned with the results on Friday. I was told about FSH levels. Normal is 10-15. They look for 30-40 to confirm diagnosis of being perimenopausal. My reading was 93!!!!! Further bloods are being done to check thyroid and inflammatory markers. When i quizzed that i was told FSH can be elevated by ovarian cancer. I have been shaking all weekend and cant eat. My anxiety is awful plus im so shocked by that 93 reading. Im a mum of two beautiful teenage boys and im really trying to hide my panic. Has anyone got any ideas or advice? help!

Had bloods and ECG done - all normal. Started CBT for the anxiety, upped my dose of HRT and did lots of meditation. And it all worked. I felt so much better and more positive.

loonarider,2020-11-13T11:59+00:00,"The worst night ever. Spasms all over my body, shortness of breath, racing heart, heavy chest...","Hi all, I am not sure whether this is linked to my period, but it is now 3 days to my flow and for the past 7 days I have noticed gradual discomfort (I have had all these symtpoms berfore only much worse this time). It first started with feeling of fullness and pressure in my chest and diaphgram area - like an invisible belt is being pulled around it. Then I noticed my breathing becoming more shallow and since I suffer with panic disorder I didn't think that at that point I was going to die. Anyway, to cut a long story short yesterday morning I woke up with a racing heart beat, it was also sligthly irregular, so of course I freak out which makes it worse. My chest got progressively tighter and full and these weird zapping like spasms throughout my chest area, thighs, sometimes in my arms. I've not had these weird spasms before, it can be sharp and very notcieable , yet not painful - it scares me no end. So here's me, thinking this is it, I'm going to die today. Even breathing was so difficult, that even lifiting my arm up was a struggle. At this point I tried to think rationally, that this would be the worst of it, then luckily it died down by the late afternoon. When I got into bed last night and as soon as I put my head down my throat felt like it was closing up, sharp pains in my back and soreness as if I had been sleeping on it all day or bed bound, couldn't find a comfortable position to sleep so I literally was sitting up in my bed crying until I eventually dozed off. Then, I jolted up from my sleep gasping for air, almost like my heart had stopped. Heart rate faster than ever, and again just burst out crying...So, I went to bed by 11 pm and didn't sleep until 5 am this morning. This is ruining my life, everyday I don't want to live as I'm scared of these horribile symptoms. I am currently seeing my doctor about this, I recently had an ECG, all normal, lungs listened to - all clear. Bloood pressure, blood glucose at the lower end of normal. So I'm fine, but doesn't take away from the fact that the physical symptoms I feel a very real and scary even if it is just hormones or all in my mind. So, she put me on pregablin, that didn't work out - the most horrible side effects and to tbh just put me off an anti-depressant at that point. So she said, maybe look at HRT, so she wants me to journal my symptoms daily and bring it to my next appointment. In the meantime I feel like I'm waiting to die...The appointment is 2 weeks away 😦 Has anyone experienced this? I'm dreading going to sleep tonight. While I feel it's not severe as I'm typing right now, I feel like it will kick off again once the head is on pillow. Why does it get so bad at night. Am I dying, have the doctors missed something? I've been to a&E too many times to know that there is nothing serious going on. I wonder if this is because my period is due soon, and it will end once flow appears? I can't stop crying and I've had enough. Please help me to not feel alone in this."

SabForMom,2017-12-08T07:27+00:00,Can Menopause come with Psychological Effects such as Brain Zaps and Brain Fog?,"My mother is 49 years old. Since August 2017, her life changed. It started with swelling in her right foot. At the time, she went to the doc about it. Some tests were done for her organs but everything was ok. The swelling went down on its own without any aid. Coincidentally, around that same time, her menopausal symptoms began. Initially she felt extreme fatigue and dizziness. She even fainted one night and was admitted at hospital and dismissed following morning. She had been to the doc prior to fainting and her iron level results came back as 11. Normal is 14 and the doc revealed that 11 was ok in women. They put her on iron supplements regardless. Then I can remember psychological changes in her. She is currently feels the following: -Brain zaps which can awaken her during sleep. -Brain fog: Wakes up out of nowhere feeling confused. -Numbness in Face, Shoulder, -Ears sometimes hurts. -Ringing in ears -Eye pain and dry eyes -Frequent nightmares -Insomnia Also, these symptoms intensify closer to her period. 2 times now prior to her period, she woke up seeing ALL white. It scares her so much, making her fear going to sleep every night. She has done CAT scan and MRI and they don't reveal anything. FSH levels come back normal. But I read that FSH can show normal during perimenopause?? Any other women experiencing same? I am so scared for her and feel like no medical professional is able to help."
trinity03,2020-11-08T23:30+00:00,Weird new perimenopause symptom-burning scalp,I've been going through peri menopause about 4 years now and have experienced dozens of odd symptoms. The latest is a sore/burning area on my scalp. It came on suddenly last night when I was walking the dog. I felt an urgent and severe need to itch. Today it's sore and feels sunburned almost. Anyone else have this happen? Is it stress? Perimenopause? Anxiety? I hate it.

I am 14 days late and I have had some significant left breast pain. It's been 5 days now. And of course because I am full of anxiety I go to the worst possible scenario! Of course my periods have been weird and all over the place and not consistent, I have an app to keep track of them. My breast pain is at the top of my breast, moves to the left side of my breast and sometime radiates to my arm pit. From other blogs I have read left breast pain is pretty common in perimenopausal women. Are others experiencing this? I just want to start my period so bad so the hormones can be released to give me some relief!"

Strated with estraderm 50mg cyclic progesterone. Levels of estrogen were 171pmol. Clinic said it was too low to increase so went onto 100mg estradot patch. Increase always makes my legs numb and tingly. I also feel the increase cause nerve ending near scar tissue to regenerate and increase my chronic pain(hence worried about increasing more plus I have HRT cause fibroid). Still felt rubbish - so tried continuous progesterone - which reduce anxiety but I think causes constant period type pains aches. so back on the cyclic which I think i feel mainly better on but axeity definitely increased. So thought check level and Im only measuring 211pmol even on the 100mg patch! Increased estrogen seems to increase my anxiety so I was sure id be really high but still low but worried about increasing more and my GP wont based on 100mg being high! Could the estraderm be a bettr patch to estradot for me? Could I try the gel? I tried testosterone in the 50mg patch but it kept converting to estrogen cos my levels werent optimised I think - how do I know if the side effects of each hormone are the same with too high or too low amounts!!

sarah090370,2020-10-26T22:01+00:00,Menopause insomnia,"Hi I just thought i might share my experience over the last 4 years hoping that it may help other women with insomnia. Particularly getting to sleep. I was 44 and one night just couldn't get to sleep. This continued and developed into CAD, Chronic Anxiety Disorder. My GP put me on antidepressants (not great) and finally sleeping tablets (which was really a last resort). This continued until over the years I have finally through years of trying found my remedy. So ladies, we are all different but we need to shout at our GPs to get us to the right people. Don't leave your surgery until you have a referral to see a consultant at your hospital menopause clinic and here's the thing...... do not stop any follow ups until they have your meds right. After 5 Years I am on HRT 25mg estrogen patches and the life saviour a HRT med called progestan (i take 200mg every night and apparently this can be increased). This makes you sleepy at night and basically changed my sleep overnight. Along with trying to exercise everday and read a book at night i am now back to my pre menopause self! I am not saying that this is for all women all i am saying is that we women need to SHOUT until we get to see the right people who can help. Best wishes to all who are tackling insomnia. I hope this helps someone. sarah"

We already ran all that on you in July and you are fine is what she kept saying. headaches, dizziness, heart palpatations, nervous/shaking feeling, tingling in arms and hands, crazy thoughts, all come and go some days worse than others...she finally did a heavy metals panel after i almost threatened her!!!! Maybe that will yield something!!! Not that i want it to i just want to know if this is indeed perimenopause. i would feel much more at ease and be better able to deal with it if i know its that!! Not knowing and then being told im not is super scary and frustrating!!! how do you know im not in perimenopause??? because of my age???? i just turned 40 and like i told her it is not impossible to start early!!!! why are you dismissing that and going straight to its mental????? she asked are my periods regular and i told her yes except my last one was 4 days and ive never had one that short. she then says oh thats normal?????? so i said ok so if i dont have a period next month i need to come back?? she said no thats normal?????

helen01355,2020-10-21T19:51+00:00,"Stiff joints for the past few years (hands, inner elbows, wrists, toes etc) - Worried silly","Hi all, I'm 48. When I was 46 I started stiffness started in my fingers, inner elbows (you know that smaller joint on the inside if you face your palms up?), wrists, left ankle, left hip and toes. This all happened within a few months and terrified me. Over time, the stiffness has become a bit achy. Much worse in the morning but I get over it after about 5 minutes. I was convinced I had RA (thanks Google!) and rang the docs. Got all the blood tests done, including anti-ccp, but all negative). I've had three lots of blood tests taken since then. Tried lots of random diets (low-carb, high carb, vegan, plant based, water fasting, dust (lol). All of this made absolutely no difference to my joints, but I have stuck with mainly plant based because I feel most energy on that. I also like animals so feel that it's more beneficial for the planet and selfishly, better for me. However, don't get me wrong, I'm no saint - I still eat and drink rubbish at times. My GP hinted at the peri-menopause, but because I still have regular periods (albeit they are slightly closer together) so I dismissed it and inwardly rolled my eyes. However, I actually think they might be right. So my question is, can you have regular periods but still have symptoms? Is it the estrogen dropping? Also can anyone relate to the absolute hell I've been through? When I started having these symptoms I actually had white fear and thought my future was bleak - thinking I had an incurable disease. It's been really tough few years. Thanks for listening x"

I have been in peri for about 4 years. My symptoms started with an increase in my already anxious in panicky self. My periods became closer, about 21-24 days apart, and heavier (and I already had heavy periods). That lasted over two years. The last year and a half they have been slowly having longer times in between (with a few short for good measure, lol). In the last 4 months it has been 51 days, 24 days and the last one was 64 days, and I am on day 8 of bleeding (which it use to last 6 days, with some 8 days) and it doesn't seem to be letting up. My anxiety is absolutely though the roof. It's even been hard for me to go anywhere for a long time (I had to go to the dentist in August and it was horrible. Thankfully they were great). I feel stressed all the time. I can't sleep. I feel like my head is detached from my body. Vertigo, ringing in the ears, exhaustion to the point I don't want to do anything, gaining weight even though I watch what I eat, feeling like I am looking at the world through fog, emotional, irritable, crying, prickly feeling all over, numbness and prickles in the face, tmj, eye twitching, achy, sore joints, tight neck and shoulders, panic attacks, and the list goes on. I do have fibromyalgia and this definitely has made it worse. I go the doctor next Friday for a complete check up, pap smear, and blood work. I haven't been to a doctor in years and I am a wreck.

Losing the will to live.","Hi lovely ladies, So, I am new here and was wondering if anyone has felt like they're on the verge of getting the flu or a cold? I have had a very dry mouth, burning tongue, a throat that isn't super sore, but sort of burning with occasional coughing, and it's bringing me down. This has been going on for months. What has added to that for the past month is a blocked nose, so blocked in fact that at night I was dreaming and felt like I was suffocating in my dream, only to jolt up gasping for breath because I actually was suffocating- both nostrils were completely blocked and extremely dry like I needed to stick vaseline up there. Not to mention I already have breathlessness issues at night, so I could have died in my sleep. I have tried saline sprays, they do nothing. I have been using Sudafed nasal spray and I am glad to say that it is a miracle, it literally clears my nose in seconds, however it is only to be used for 3 days, whereas I have been addicted to it for a month now. I have tried to wean off it and the blocked nose comes back. I'm stuck and I need your help and recommendations. 😦 I am at my wits end. Scared of bedtime now, when it used to be the only time of the day where i would get respite from feeling miserable all day with other symptoms of peri. Now, I don't even have that peace of mind, so no sleep has given rise to body aches and pains, probably rising cortisol levels from lack of sleep. Can't win and everything has had a knock on effect on my health. So to wrap it up, what bothers me the most and scares me somewhat is the dry sore throat and coughing and the blocked nose, it's ruining my quality of life seriously. Any remedies for this incessant congestion and dryness would be appreciated. Hope you're all doing ok xxx"

I have most of the 66 symptoms and so far I'd seen my OBGYN, rheumatologist and ENT (teleconsult). My initial bloodworks were all normal but I still have lots of tests I need done, also other doctors to see. I'm having a tough time getting it all done because I'm so scared I'd get Covid19 if I go to the hospital/doctor's ofc I actually get anxiety attack everytime I step away from the house. How is everyone going to the doctor's/getting tests done these days?"

HELP!!!,"I just turned 40 on the 22nd of this month and i cannot begin to tell you what i have been experiencing for the last several months. From dizziness to panic attacks that resulted in a 2am 911 call to family care dr appt and bloodwork to OBGYN bloodwork to a cardiologist visit to try and figure out what in the world is going on with me. All bloodwork came back normal Thank God except my iron was low. Tightness in my chest to where i feel like i cant take a deep enough breath to heart palpatations, tingling all over my body and numbness in my fingers to now i cant even describe all the symptoms. Headaches, allergies bad when ive NEVER had a problem with allergies. It all comes and goes. I just feel funny and not like myself. It is exhausting and scary. After lots of research and doctors telling me im fine i have come to the conclusion that im in perimenopuase. My cycle came on this month and was 4 days, i have NEVER had one that short then 2 days later it came back on a little bit! SMH! i have found that several women say they experience the same things. Some days im ok, some days i feel terrible. i am so tired of feeling like this and it is scary when you are experiencing symptoms because it feels like its serious and you need to go to the ER! I find taking deep breaths calms me down so i dont trigger a panic attack as well as i am taking every kind of supplement. i have noticed some symptoms subside but then it seems as if another one comes! SMH! please help???"

After looking at side effects of Tibolone I am wondering if this could be the cause of pain. it worsens towards the end if the day and is more painful when I am sitting down. I also have had headaches and a couple if migraines. Has any one else had problems ? it started out well with less tender breasts and hardly any hot flushes and my libido did improve slightly but that has disappeared again as well. Any advice welcome.

I'm so tired of being sick and tired all the time. Now yesterday I started with a new issue. Pain in my right armpit. There's no swelling or lump just aching and discomfort. Had anyone else dealt with this? Peri has made my anxiety through the roof and made me a hypochondriac!! So as you can guess I'm freaking out! I am a few days away from my period or at least I think I am. They seem to be all over the place lately. I'd love to hear back if anyone else has experienced this. Thank you all!"

It goes away with antiseptic powder and/or cream but was wondering if any of you ladies have had this. Also, I need help. I love this forum and all the amazing ladies who make us all feel like we are not losing our minds and alone as even the doctors look at you like you are crazy. One question tho (and maybe admin can help here): When I start a new post, comment on a post or someone responds to me, how do I easily finds this without going through hundreds threads. This forum (unless I am doing something wrong) does not have a very good ""search"" tab for symptom specific topics. Thanks ladies and if any of you can help with or comment on that rash situation, that would be great. I don't think I am diabetic or hope not so that is what is scaring me right now.

I'm 58 and have for the last six months or so been experiencing such fatigue it's really interfering with my life. It has coincided with the pandemic which has really fudged things. I've been treated for anxiety which has been heightened by Covid, but I can see there's a correlation with my symptoms and being post-menopausal for three years. Only recently did one doctor mention that fatigue could be the menopause-up to that point it had been assumed I had post-viral fatigue because I had a cold (not Covid) in March!! Others on the forum describe having aches and pains all over the body and a feeling of having bruised ribs on the left side (weird) both of which I have. Also, a daily feeling of just being off and like I'm not in my own body, and having low energy. I have to pace myself on walks, sitting down more often which leaves me paranoid that I have a heart problem! Does anyone else experience that they can't walk as far as they once did without resting? I feel like a very old lady sometimes! It's all so miserable. I don't get hot flushes though. I'm taking more Vitamin D at the moment and have picked up HRT patches which I will start using but a little wary of the likely side effects e.g. nausea, bloating etc. Can anyone here relate?"

Gastric pain and once the gas is relieved , the pain subsides. a few years ago, I had sleep trouble but now i got adjusted and as i know now that its all my hormones playing that i keep calm, but initially when i could not t sleep i was terrified. I went to the GP and she gave me medication, told me to come to back for a blood test, if the gas problem still persists. Hope everything goes well and I dont have have to go back.

How can something that affects 50% of the population & 30% of those seriously p, still be so poorly serviced? I live in Norfolk & there's not a single NHS perimenopause clinic here, the nearest is Colchester 85 miles away, after nearly 2 years of horrendous symptoms no referral has been offered? Don't get me started on the lack of hrt medication availability & the woefully inflexible & unresponsive prescription issuing . I read on here how so many of us are really suffering but what do any of us do. Never mind BLM! MWM, menopausal women matter! it's time to petition the government, do something positive!

ACanadian,2020-09-28T18:32+00:00,Irregular heartbeat during exercise - is this a peri symptom?,"Hi all, Yesterday I noticed a new symptom, that repeated today: when doing cardio, my chest felt a bit weird (not painful, just feeling faintly funny) and when I checked my pulse, it kept changing - slowing down a bit for 4-5 beats, speeding up a bit for 4-5 beats, slowing down again, etc. I normally do cardio a couple of times a week and also walk regularly to try and stay relatively fit (although I am overweight). Has anyone else had this? Is it another peri symptom - I know peri can cause palpitations, but I don't think this is palpitations, as I can't feel my heart race or skip? Or is it something unrelated? I started having peri symptoms in the spring and early summer: light hot flushes, so you feel slightly warm but not furnace hot, initially was once or twice a month, but now are 2-3x a day lightheaded for a month or two in the spring, but that's now gone hair started falling out around the hairline and my part, leaving me with a semi-bald patch about 3cm wide. lots of general body aches, skin breaking out and rashes, etc., but I'm also very stressed (stupid Covid and I'm also unemployed), so that could also be causing a lot of these things. The hair loss is what caused me to go to the GP. A bunch of blood tests ruled out thyroid or pituitary problems, iron or zinc deficiencies (just low in Vit D), but FSH showed menopausal levels, although I'm still having periods (although rarely, as I have a coil and only get a period about once a year). Currently waiting for my appointment with the dermatologist, but the GP thinks is most likely hormones (from peri as well as stress). I'm 46 years old. I had suspected early peri 5 years ago (I had the lightheadedness for months, as well as about 6 weeks of palpitations - doc checked me out and found everything normal except my FSH was all over the place - some months normal and some months menopausal) but then the symptoms all went away, and I assumed it was a false start. I didn't have my FSH checked during the intervening years, but had no peri symptoms so I assume everything went back to normal. Thanks for any insight you can share - hope you all feel better soon!"

anz76,2020-09-21T16:46+00:00,Stress - peri - feel so scared! strange symptoms oh and smoking... (not proud),"Hi all, After a big stressor in my life all my hormones seem to have dropped. It happened very quickly after the event. I had an early lighter period that very month. I've had various blood tests and I'm not below normal but on all the low ends for both estrogen and progesterone. I'm only 40 so hormones were probably already declining a bit but the extreme stress has knocked them even lower. (testosterone is fine). I'm relating to most of the symptoms I've read you all having on here but yet to come across a couple that I am having, Is anyone else experiencing a softness to their bodies? It's not so much a numbness, hard to articulate, but I feel like the pads of my fingertips dont have the same strength or feeling when, say typing. Also around my mouth. I feel like I've lost any weight to my skin and strength around and in my mouth. Its a similar sort of feeling and its all freaking me out. Not to mention a drastic decline in my skin in the space of 3 months. Can it really be that rapid??? I feel like my face has aged 10 years. My hair also suddenly shedding rapidly. Period was off for 2 months (early by 5/6 days) last month was back to 27 day cycle but very very light for 7 days. (and mostly brown blood for last 3 days) I've been really hoping that if i get on top of all my stress and make big life changes my hormones might have a chnace of rebalancing themselves? Anyone else had that experience? Grateful for any response. I smoke and KNOW i have to give that up to give my hormones a chance. Has anyone else given up smoking and had their hormones get better? Thanks"

I'm 45 and for the last 3 years my periods are very on and off, I can go for 5 months with nothing then regular for 3 months. I know this is normal (my mum went through an early menopause). However, since March I haven't had a ""normal period"" and have been spotting, so it started out maybe one day in a fortnight but has slowly got closer together to the point now where I have been bleeding for over 4 weeks. It's very light, only one sanitary pad per day. I have very very mild cramping at times. I did have a telephone consultation with my GP the other day who said she thinks it's related to peri menopause, all my smears are up to date and I had a cervical polyp removed last year so obviously nothing showed up on camera in my cervix. Despite this because it's a new symptom for me I'm obviously stressing that it might be something else."

I went to my gp that put me on omeprazole but after a couple of months I was still suffering so they decided to do blood test,a stool sample test,referred me for a ultrasound which I'm due to have on the 28th sept and then today I got a call asking my permission to give a gastroenterologist department my details which obviously I agreed to and was told to wait for an appointment. Now after my blood and stool tests I havnt recieved any calls from my gp so assumed theres nothing to worry about but today when I got the call from my gp receptionist about the gastroenterologist my anxiety shot to pieces. I'm hoping that if any of my test had come back normal I would have had a call way before today?? Sorry for the long saga"

For the past 3-4 weeks I've had a lot of breast tenderness that felt much like old PMS symptoms. For the past 24 hours I've had horrible, awful cramps. Some nausea too but I think that's from the pain - and actually, it was never unusual for me to feel nauseous when I had bad cramping. Pregnancy not a concern. Ibuprofen helped me sleep a little last night but still didn't totally remove the pain. I'm guessing this may be either a period about to start, or at least my body trying to have a period. I'm pretty miserable though. Wondered other experiences? TY!"

I have started about 10 weeks ago having awful stomach problems burping acid reflux food takes ages to digest empty hollow feeling at top of stomach and a pain sometimes in same area and gurgling all over lots of saliva in mouth tooibs symptoms never feel like I've fully cleared my bowel go most days though. It all started when I was going through a really really bad time with anxiety and I wasn't eating much and taking diazipam every day that the Doctor prescribed. I have stopped taking the meds now only take as I need them as Dr said diazapam can cause stomach issues . I'm not so sure . Ive had a abdominal ultrasound and abdominal ct scan all clear except swollen adrenal gland and fibroid all checked nothing to worry about . Also had a ca125 blood test all normal. My anxiety is so bad as keep worrying something very wrong with me . All I do is think abut my stomach all day which I know doesn't help . I'm on nexiem 20mg but really don't want to be on these long term. Anyone else going through this . xx
fran54078,2020-09-08T22:23+00:00,anyone has low blood pressure with menopause?,"Hi Ladies, I am peri menopausal. My symptoms started last October. They started with constant dizziness, then came burry vision, sensitive hearing, and head discomfort. Lately, I found my blood pressure has been low for the past several month. Systolic blood pressure in the 70s-80s. I heard blood pressure increase with menopause. I am wondering if low blood pressure could be a symptom too. Has anyone experiencing/experienced this?"
Guest,2018-12-17T00:45+00:00,"Constant Peri symptoms - heavy tired blurry eyes, dizzy, neck pain","I am a newby here and just wanted to find out if other women are suffering from any symptoms that are constant? This is probably my health anxiety talking, but I seem to have a few head issues which are all the time these days and I just can't believe that they can be attributed to hormones. I have the symptoms that come and go, like fatigue, insomnia, palpitations, tingling in extremities, jelly legs, burning tongue, dry eyes, headaches, light sensitivity, overheating, bloating, spotting, lighter periods, tummy issues and crushing anxiety. But I also have symptoms that are EVERY DAY! Like spacey vision, dizziness/off balance (this has recently become constant), achy/pressure and tired eyes and neck pain. I have had SO many tests like brain MRI's & MRA, spinal MRI sinus CT, chest xray, dental xrays, ophthalmologist testing, vaginal ultrasounds and nothing has been found. Am I the only one having these constant symptoms and can they really be attributed to all of this hormonal craziness?"
Guest,2020-08-12T10:44+00:00,So sick of this garbage!!,"Why is it that some of us have to suffer so greatly from perimenopause and menopause?? I havent had a period in over a year but feeling sick has just gotten worse since my periods went away instead of getting better!! At least when i had periods i knew when i would feel sick so i could plan to do things while i was well. I would feel bad during ovulation, and before and after my period....I would have one week a month where i could function.....now I dont have any good times it seems. Im so angry cause this past weekend i thought the hell was ending. For 3 full days i had an appetite, I didnt feel sick, i had energy, no anxiety or depression at all.....i did have an ovary aching feeling but i didnt mind that....then bam the ovary ache is completely gone but for 2 days im so sick i cant eat, i feel super exhausted & that is making me feel very depressed. Why does it have to be like this??? My mom looks and feels healthy as a horse after menopause, she never suffered like this. She said she has mild anxiety & depression that she takes antidepressants for but other than that shes good! ive tried the antidepressants they make me feel way worse and yes ive taken them for at least 2 months before giving up, they add more awful symptoms that dont go away. I wont take hormones as cancer runs in our family and i wont take that risk. Life is becoming so unbearable....ive been suffering for 8 years now although it feels more like 20!"

Feeling pretty dreadful and suffering with an assortment of horrendous symptoms. Raging anxiety, self doubt, feelings of doom, tight chest, woozy, faint feeling, jelly legs, hot flashes, waking a lot at night, exhaustion, lacking energy and loss of appetite etc.. Some days I feel better and then the next I’m plunged into feeling low and run down again. I’m on HRT already but think I need a dose adjustment and the GP has put me on antidepressants recently and a PPI to help with my indigestion type symptoms. I’m also getting some blood tests and an ECG as I’ve had palpitations. It’s just a real trial isn’t it. I just want to feel more like me again. I’m very weepy. I have been making myself go jogging and walking, am taking menopause supplements, have tried acupuncture and meditation and I am thinking about some CBT type stuff. So I’m trying to calm myself and be active rather than lying around but it’s tough with the lack of energy. I just hope to find that I’m not alone and am also looking for any suggestions about how to cope, things I could do, remedies/supplements I could try etc.. Thanks so much."

A month ago I had what I thought was a uti, phoned doctors and they prescribed a weeks course of antibiotics which helped. I still keep going to pass urine frequently and through the night, it does not hurt whilst going its after my vagina feels on fire. I have read that all of this is due to the menopause, I was wondering if any of you are the same or have any ideas of what can help. At the moment it hurts even to sit for long periods, I am at a loss. And I am really worried that its something serious. I just feel so sore"
GreyCat,2020-08-29T18:14+00:00,Very confused please help me!,"I've been ill for three months, I've had to give up my job, drs are struggling to diagnose me. I'm very confused as my symptoms are cyclical and some seem like peri but others just don't add up. At or near the start of my period I get very ill, very weak, shaky and nauseous feeling. But I also have this thing going on with my neck - the first month it happened I couldn't sit down without feeling a strange neck pain, dizziness, tingling in my shoulder and back. I also notice that on bad days, moving my arms triggers nauseous yuk feelings. Then each cycle I start to recover and feel less shaky and nauseous and the neck and back thing feels more of a conventional neck issue - my physiotherapist said it was minor trapped nerves. But where I'm confused is why this all gets so much worse at the start of my cycle. And if it is just trapped nerves why do I get lots of other symptoms too - weak, shaky, loss of appetite, need loo all the time, buzzing and twitching, heavy legs, high anxiety bursts / adrenaline rushes, feel hot in the night, broken sleep. I'm going round in circles, I decide it's peri then think that the way I feel ill when I move my arms can't possibly be peri, its too obscure. Then I decide it's all caused by the trapped nerves but that leaves all of the other symptoms unexplained and doesn't explain the cycle of worse then recovering that follows my menstrual cycle. Anyone got any idea what's going on with me?"
loonarider,2020-04-28T14:55+00:00,So many new and old symptoms that I simply can't handle anymore! Ugh :(,"Hi all, I have been having sore throat and most recently a dry non persistent cough that comes on intermittently., and it comes on usually in the evening and at night, and sometimes it wakes me up. which is a bit scary. Not to mention I've had ongoing shortness of breath issues which started very gradually a few years ago, I was 40 at that point. In addition to that, I have constant pain in my left arm as though I've pulled a muscle or have been lifiting weights incorrectly. Most recently, I have pretty much experienced panic attacks all day everyday for a month - so this includes the shakes and chest tightness. Then the sensation of a belt tightening around my diaphragm felt all day which prevents me from eating the smallest bit of food. I have had check ups before the covid crisis including a chest scan/blood work and everything always comes back as normal. What is the most significant and scary symptom which my doctors don't seem to be helpful with is that I get air hunger like my organs are being squashed and my heart is about to stop when I try to sleep on either side, so I'm left with sleeping on my back to the point that due to not being able to change position, I've perpetual pain and aches all over. I really don't get any sleep any more. I'm so fed up, and there have been days where I just wish I wasn't alive. I know it's depressing but I don't know how to live with this any more. Most days I'm going to my room away from my partner and step-kids to cry my eyes out. I'm only 42 and this isn't the lie I envisaged. I know that these symptoms may mostly be peri menopause, but a part o me thinks could be dying of something sinister, or I have contracted COVID-19. I'm at my wits end. I can't cope and feel as though I'm living in the twilight zone. Anybody in the same boat,? I don't want to be alone in this and I just feel so empty and invisible and fed up."

This morning i found a lump in (urm) feel embarrased to say in my rectum as have external piles that come and go and could feel burning.

Started fresh with a new provider and found out I have 0 (seriously) estrogen, low progesterone and low testosterone. Ive been on compounded hormone cream for almost five weeks and while the awful symptoms went away for a few days, they have come back again. I requested a referral to see a cardiologist in a few weeks. Does anyone elae have these symptoms? Sometimes I also get pain in my left rib that goes into my back. I will be 49 tomorrow."

After this period I also had a 3 day headache. I am worried I'm putting everything down to peri and its really something more sinister-anyone else have any of these symptoms?

Without them, I basically only sleep, collectively, three or so hours a night. Recently, I have to actually beg my doctor to continue prescribing the hormones.

Guest,2020-08-19T15:24+00:00,Elimination diet help the nausea?,"This is probably a stupid question but has anyone eliminated fructose and some other gut sensitive foods from their diets and it actually helped their nausea? This is crazy.....i cant eat ANYTHING anymore without waking up the next day nauseous and my gut is gassy and bloated. I never have diarrhea, in fact i mostly suffer from slow digestion and constipation but heres what is odd when i wake up feeling terrible all i can normally stomach during the day is natural peanut butter with saltine crackers, mashed potatoes, cottage cheese, grilled cheese sandwiches and decaf tea... i can even eat candy bars then i will wake up the next day feeling absolutely fine stomach wise so i go back to eating foods like applesauce, peas, tomatoes, soda pop, cheeseburgers and i wake up sick the next day all over again! Ive tried eliminating cheese and all dairy products for two weeks but ate the fruits & veges and i was very sick still do i know it isnt dairy bothering me. Besides on my bad days i eat or drink dairy and i will wake up the next day feeling fine. I read that sometimes you can develop food sensitives in menopause and one of the big culprits is fructose. That is in A lot of food i consume. I was just curious if anyone has had a food sensitivity issue since hitting peri and once they found the culprit their stomach issues got better? Oh and i was tested for celiac disease which i dont have."

Some foods would make a small bump appear on my throat- it usually disappears in few hours. My ears feel heavy. When I eat the throat feeling gets a bit better, but the full and heavy ears do not.

I also feel weaker, somewhat light headed. Slight nausea and stomach upset comes and goes. Have eye problems- saw an eye doctor and she said some layer at the back of my eyes is peeling and it will feel better once it is fully peeled.

I was skipping periods not seeing them for two to three months. Now I have been having a period every month since May like I used to when I was in my 20's like every 23 days. I had gotten used to the intermittent periods. I spoke to my older sister who is 3 years post meno and she said that she went regular for a few months right before she completely stopped having them. Hopefully I'm getting closer to the end of this madness. All I know is that this particular period this month has made me feel really ill with a lot of bloating and gas pains in my lower abdomen. I have been having a lot of bm's today with that nervous anxiety feeling. (Sorry for theTMI). It's probably the sudden surge of estrogen triggering this especially since I wasn't having periods regularly. Has anyone else had this experience?"

I have IC and OAB. I previously was on Vesicare in my thirties for OAB and was able to stop it. Once perimenopause hit around 43, I noticed all my urinary symptoms plus IC started. I tried Vesicare again and it resulted in having to go to the ER due to fast heart rate. I tried Oxytrol patch but that gave me horrible headaches. My husband had pumpkin seed oil capsules 1000mg that he bought for his heart. In my readings, I found that it also helped people with my urinary symptoms. Even better, there are no side effects and is was good for my IC. I take one in morning and one in evening - with some food. I started them and immediately noticed a difference. For some people it does take a few weeks to one month. Anyway - I don't feel my urethra or bladder. I haven't felt this good in years.

LessrTuberosity,2020-08-15T13:30+00:00,90+ days no period from age 43 - is it menopause?,"Hi, I am now 45yrs old and at day 123 with no period. My irregularities started around age 42, with having two periods in a month, followed by three months with no period. This happened for a few cycles. Then it would return to normal for a few months. Then I started having more of these long cycles of 90+ days with no period. I went 90 days without a period for the first time at age 42. Over the last three years I have had six cycles of about three months with no period. I do get some very mild brown spotting at times, but I have not counted these as periods, as they do not follow a normal cycle. I dont bother dping pregnancy tests anymore because I just figure Im not ovulating! I have been seeing a gyno the whole time, who sends me for regular internal ultrasound tests. He says Im not ovulating but does not know why. He kept saying I was too young for menopause but lately just says it is kind of normal!?. I have never had children.

I feel like my legs and arms are permanently full of lactic acid. I'm down to an hour cycling, no hectic pushing and it is exhausting . I feel like I've run a marathon. I can't get fit in fact I just get more and more tired. I tried every second day. Now it's every third day - or longer. I feel nauseous after my cycle. My appetite has gone. It has been like this for the last 3 years. It feels like physical activity does the complete opposite of what it used to do. It sucks the life out of me. I'm on HRT. Experimented coming off it. Two weeks passed then it was like I'd been hit by a bus! I couldn't even drive a car. Insomnia, restless legs, excessive sweating, extreme anxiety, extreme weakness and fatigue and arthritis in my hands flared up really badly and hasn't calmed down much. I was booked off work for a week - went back on my HRT in that time. No more insomnia or restless legs or hot flushes (least of my problems!) and fatigue and weakness reduced back to what I am again. Will this ever pass? I eat very healthily , even though I have a poor appetite, I drink lots of fluids. No alcohol, I don't smoke, one coffee a day, meditation every day. I take it very easy on myself but I am like a useless jellyfish. Is this it for the rest of my life? Will I ever be able to exercise again? Vigorous walking is also out of the question."

jen78653,2020-07-22T14:43+00:00,"Cyclical Passing of Large Urine - PMS , End of Period and Ovulation","Hi, I have a new symptom that I noticed has started in my perimenopause road trip. I suffer from OAB (5- 1000mg of pumpkin seed oil) helps me out. In addition, I have IC and I have a regime I follow via aloe vera pills, strict diet and prelief. In addition, I noticed that aside from these two issues I have certain time in the month (usually PMS, end of my period and end of ovulation) where I pee a lot (not just frequency but large amounts of urine). Has anyone else experienced this? I believe it is related to bloating caused by hormone changes. I don't feel terribly bloated and the increased urine amount only last a few hours to one day at best. I don't really use much salt, but I have also cut down even more. I read on another forum that a woman referred to it as cyclical large amount of urination. PS. Due to OAB and IC I have had a lower MRI and came back without any issues. I have also been tested for bladder cancer, all infections, etc via a urogyn. Would love to hear if anyone else has this issue.... Thanks!"

dianep61,2020-07-22T14:40+00:00,"Constant headache, stiff neck, burning face","Hi, I'm 59 and aged 50 my periods just stopped dead. I then started to get the hot flushes and went on HRT. The first real symptom I started to get was parasthesia in both my lower legs to the point where I just couldn't feel them. It was continuous for about 6 months. I eventually ended up at a Neurologist who almost laughed me out of his office. Maybe that was the cure I needed as I had been very anxious which probably didn't help. I stopped taking the HRT and within a couple of weeks I was back to normal. I've had hot flushes on and off for the last 9 years but have otherwise been OK. In April this year I had a terrible headache (I write this because I've seen a couple of other posts about this). Since then I have had a stiff neck and the same feelings I used to have in my legs but confined completely to my head and face. Zapping pains, burning, waves of coldness rising from my neck up the back of my head. I have had blood tests (but not hormone levels) and have had a brain MRI. It did show a couple of spots and I have to go for another although the neurologist is reassuring me he doesn't think it's MS as I have no other symptoms. Of course, I'm very anxious but wondered if anyone else had the sensations in their face and head."

Here are the symptoms that I am dealing with... Physical: bloating, alternating lack of appetite with insatiable hunger, numbness, disorientation, GI issues, tingling all over my body with numbness, cold extremities, exhaustion... Psychological: rage, brain fog, irritability, severe emotional distress, depression, anxiety, obsessiveness, loss of joy, hopelessness... I just never knew anything could be this severe or take this long to get through. I have tried every med, including HRT, and nothing has even touched this. I am a healthy person who eats well and exercises daily. I don't have any medical conditions. And even though perimenopause isn't technically a disease, it certainly feels like one. I have an amazing support network (spouse, mother, close friends), but it is still so hard to get through the day. I feel absolutely shattered by the end of it. I know that perimenopause can't last forever, but I feel like I am losing my life to this, as I have struggled for so long. I have every symptom of high estrogen, so I am certain that this is the issue. I just want my hormones to calm down, so I can enjoy the beautiful life that I know I have.

lesley55485,2020-07-09T13:55+00:00,Peri symptoms ramped up.,"Hi, I've been perimenopausal for at least the last 3 to 4 years. I've had many different symptoms over the years, tried lots of supplements, been put on alsorts of meds thru the doctors. I've been on the pill (Microgygnon) for a while now as it initially helped mask the symptoms. But I think I may need something stronger nowadays. My main symptoms at the minute are Sinus problems Teeth problems Hot flushes Crashing fatigue No appetite Fuzzy forgetful head Funny taste in mouth/dry mouth Aches No motivation Periods lighter and a lot shorter Stomach ache GERD But my main worrying symptoms at the moment are Breathlessness and anxiety. I noticed about 5 or 6 weeks ago my breathing wasn't good. I am asthmatic but it's not that type of breathlessness. I feel like I can't get a full breath in, air hunger it's described as. I feel like someone's sat at the bottom of my lungs. It seems to come on a lot worse at certain points in my cycle. Worse around ovulation and this week just before a period. I'm also feeling a lot more anxious, the breathing is causing the anxiety to feel worse too as I panic when I feel I can't breathe but it's a vicious cycle. I have previously been prescribed Propranolol for anxiety when I had a bit of a breakdown last year, I have been taking the odd dose of it when I feel I need to calm down. it helps but I don't like the way it makes me feel, spaced out, tired and sick. Has anyone found anything that helps with the breathlessness?"

tebrown96,2020-01-06T12:49+00:00,Monthly rash?,"Hello ladies. I was a frequent visitor on this board a year or so ago when I began to experience a million different symptoms that had my going out of my mind. It seems to all be perimenopause related and for the most part, my anxiety has simmered down and I tend to just chalk any random thing up to hormones now 😃 for better or worse. I do have a new question, though - does anyone experience a widespread hives-type rash that pops up every month, mid-way through your cycle? I first developed this rash in early October, thought (and doc agreed) that it was an allergic reaction to something, but no idea what. It went away after a short course of prednisone. I got my period 9 days later, but at the time, saw no connection. I did not get the rash in November, but it was a wonky month for me and my cycle was very long. Then, the rash came back on December 4th (2 months to the day it appeared in October). My doc had me see both a dermatologist and an allergist - neither of which could properly diagnose it. However this time, the derm told me to take Allegra instead of putting me on a steroid and it cleared up within 2 doses. My period came 9 days later. Incredibly, the rash showed up again yesterday (Jan 5th) and my period is due on the 14th. I'm beginning to think this is more than coincidence. The last 2 times the rash appeared, it was not itchy. This time, however, it is. I did take an Allegra yesterday and it seemed to stop the rash from spreading. I took another this morning and am hoping to see it begin to resolve. I plan on calling the allergist when the office opens, but also wanted to see if anyone here had experience something similar. Thanks!"

lesley55485,2020-07-10T05:10+00:00,"Flushes, stomach and adrenaline.","Hi, me again. So the last month or so has seen a change in my symptoms. Had been having night sweats about a year ago then they changed to only happening every now and again. Over the last 5 weeks I've had 2 weird times in the night. 1st time I woke up suddenly with the urge to go to the toilet and was sweating. Made it to the toilet where my bowels were looser. Had weird feeling in head, stomach and the most intense shakes and shivers. Felt like an adrenaline surge. I had not got a temperature even though I was shivering and sweating. After about 15 mins of shakes, shivers and the adrenaline surge I stopped sweating and felt brighter again. Tonight, I woke up sweating and far too warm, laid uncovered for a bit but then the weird adrenaline surge started again. Too hot, sick and shaky. Went to the loo, stomach felt weird. This lasted less time than the last one. Still feel nauseated. Have taken anti sickness meds and am now wide awake feeling rubbish. Does anyone else get anything like this? I'm on the pill microgygnon, last month when it happened it was just at the end of what should have been ovulation. I've started my pill back to back this week, but if cycles had fallen as normal I'd have had a period start yesterday.. Seems like new symptoms crop up monthly."

I have had menopause symptoms for the last five years but this last year it has really ramped up in making my life actually a misery. I have had big problems with my digestive system, anxiety, night sweats, joint pains, hair thinning, brain fog and have been on HRT for the last 18 months. I would say the only thing HRT has done is eased the night sweats. I have gone from upper GI issues to my rear end and pelvis in constant dull pain. I have had tests but nothing sinister has been found thank goodness but no real answers either. It is uncomfortable to sit down and I live with a dull ache. I have been sorting out my diet, losing weight at a snail pace, eating more fibre, I exercise with walking and. pilates. I don't drink that much alcohol only on a socially. Just seeing if any of you are experiencing these really irritating symptoms and what has helped you. I just hope there is a light at the end of the Meno Tunnel as it is one miserable thing to go through..."

About 3 weeks ago I had what I thought was a bladder infection I checked my urine as I work in a surgery and only showed blood on dipstick no other signs like nitrates or leucocytes which would indicate bacteria. So went to my Doc worried sick about blood on dips tick but not visible blood He checked it on his and sticks and said he couldn't see anything but sent it to lab and it came back clear . He gave me a antibiotic anyway as I had symptoms took them for 3 days and symptoms cleared up. But now 3 weeks later the symptoms are back pressure on bladder needing to pee constantly I feel irratated inside now thinking maybe thrush as well but not the usual symptoms of this so not sure. I suffer bad anxiety and I've convinced myself I have bladder cancer because of pressure and blood I found on dipstick test although although I've read this is quite common in woman but I'm terrified as to why all this is back again.I'm 48 is this all peri too just another horrid symptoms? .

I had a benign polyp removed in December, 2019. They did two uterine biopsies--one in October and one in December, 2019. All was normal. But I am terrified they missed something and I am dying. I called the on call doctor this weekend and she was pretty rude. ""Call the office."" So that didn't help. What have you ladies experienced? Is this relatively normal towards the end? I am 53 and was feeling fantastic until Friday."

Until today when it came back, 178 days later. (January 2020 was the first time I had skipped a period since I was 12 years old.) I thought there was nothing but daylight at the nearly 6 month mark. But here we are. What have you ladies experienced with skipping/crowding of periods towards the end of peri? Do you think work/stress had any contributing factor(s)? Or is it just the randomness of hormones? The months I missed my period were paradise! No hot flashes, better sleep, better control of my appetite, Instead of losing half the month to PMS and excruciating cramps, I was able to work out consistently, 6 days a week..... If I am back in that horrible rotation I will be pretty sad. Thanks!"

Well yesterday It finally started and it was normal. However not so much when I woke up this morning. I usually get the morning gush from laying but this time was different. I literally leaped from bed like a sprinter in a race!! I'm not sure if I was flooding but did have a fairly good size clot sorry tmi in my pad! Is this normal? Could it be from missing almost 2 months. Please help me with some reassurance before my anxiety kicks me in the arss and I start thinking crazy things.
elle85542,2020-05-05T17:20+00:00,Missed period and peri menopause nausea?,"Hi, I'm in my early 40s and haven't yet officially been diagnosed with peri menopause, but I've been wondering if it can cause severe nausea and dizzyness as your periods become more irregular? My period is two weeks late, and in the early hours of monday morning when I got up to go to the loo I felt very dizzy, and when I got back in bed I suddenly started shaking and felt hot for several minutes. Later on when I woke up, I vomited and couldn't tolerate sitting up or standing so had to go back to bed as I felt fine lying down. I was sick again a few hours later when I tried to get up, and I didn't feel like eating so went back to bed again. Early tuesday evening and I've been in bed for two days and not eaten a thing until now (I'm forcing down a slice of toast) and the nausea seems to have gone but i still have to stand up slowly or I still feel a little dizzy. Something similar happened last year when my period was a month late, but the feelings only lasted a few hours and there was no vomiting. So, is this kind of thing common when you are approaching the menopause? Oh, and there is no way I'm pregnant as im not sexually active."

jamie37119,2020-06-09T06:56+00:00,New changes in perimenopause,"Hi all, well I don't even know how long I have been going through the changes (peri) I do know that when I had my son at age 41 I had my first ever night sweat. I put that down to hormones after giving birth. Then I was just hot all the time, literally all the time. I moved to a city that was much colder and was still looking like a beetroot and like my face, upper body, neck etc were always hot. Then one day I started having what was stated to be a ""hot flash"" but it wasn't hot at all, I never sweated like I did with night sweats, and I wasn't hot like I was previous all the time. I would feel heat in my upper body/arms/upper legs/ neck and with that was like a rush... then I would feel somewhat short of breath which then would become an irregular heartbeat, a strange cramp in my lower stomach, and sometimes I would feel faint and shaky. I would also get icy cold hands and feet and afterwards chills would come. Well the other indications at that time that peri was coming was that my periods were every two weeks. I went to the doctors and I had a blood test, my iron being slightly low, and my hormones indicating early menopause. That was 2.5 years ago now. My periods evened out a bit and I was having a period every 24 days or so and usually 3 to 5 days long, with only one or two days relatively heavy. This last period has now got me thinking a new transition. I had spotting at day 19, then a week later I got my period, it was heavy for two days and literally went for 7 days, stopped, and now it is back again a day later...is this common near the end of perimenopause? Frankly over this rollercoaster ride."

I just (6 months ago) began being sexually active again after being celibate for a long time.. I have a boyfriend now although i use condoms i have concern about becoming pregnant because they arent a 100 percent safe. My dr told me a long time ago that its a risk of becoming pregnant during menopause. Is this a concern for anybody that is sexually active? Do you know or have you heard of any woman becoming pregnant during menopause? not peri menopause but full menopause?

charcey97,2020-06-08T13:55+00:00,Perimenopausal Cysts?,"Hi ladies. Quick history. Had a partial hysterectomy (left ovaries only) 3 years ago. Was diagnosed last year by US with a small complex cyst (hemorrhagic) that calcified on my right ovary and again on my left ovary with another one a couple months ago. Also, had a pelvic MRI a couple months ago which was normal, other than some cysts. Each time, I had pains that brought me to seek answers. Most of the time, it wasn’t excruciating, but it was enough to cause me worry. Usually felt like a pulling or tugging feeling with some sharp pains on my side (where ovary is) and would extend up and over my hip. My pelvic area would also be sensitive, especially with exertion like sneezing or coughing. This would bring on the sharp stabbing pains (Like the ones you get when your pregnant and the ligaments are stretching) and bloating. It would last for weeks. This time started the same a couple weeks ago, but now I have the sharp pains just from stretching and there is definite generalized aching across the pelvis in between the sharp pains...and of course, bloating. The achiness seems to be worse in the morning. Anyone experience this with cysts?"

Keljo48,2020-05-31T14:41+00:00,All over itchiness and skin issues.,"Hello, I am nearly 3 years postmenopause and 52 years old. I know there is something seriously wrong with me but I don't know what it is and how to get help to treat it. I have chronic dry mouth where I get crusties at the corner of my mouth regularly. I am forever checking and clearing them off. (I know gross). I have had off and on itchy skin and especially scalp but it has become worse. It's not severe gouge my skin itching, it's just moves. I itch a place on my arm, shoulder, thigh, scalp, back, butt cheek, calf, feet, etc. I lightly scratch or rub and it moves to a different location. It's my face and neck and even my vaginal area, the creases between my thighs hands. I don't have a rash that itches, it isn't red. It just moves through my whole body and driving me insane. I have had some itchiness for awhile but for whatever reason it has ramped up in the past week and it's making me crazy. I also have terrible skin. A lump on my lower side of my right leg is varicose. I have spider veins all over. Carbuncle like bumps on my thighs and elsewhere that my doctor says is part of aging and not to worry. How can I not worry and feel depressed. There is no end. I seem to either always have a vaginal yeast infection or BV. My blood sugar is fine. I take meds to control my blood pressure. To top that off I noticed that the right side of my face and neck are larger than the left. Has it always been this way and has weight gain made it more pronounced? My gland on the right side of my neck between my ear and chin I can feel it. It was achy and I went to see my NP and she felt for my thyroid and said it felt fine and that those glands (my enlarged one ) are called shotty glands. She says it happens to try and fight off infection and she felt it was nothing to worry about. Worry? Understatement of the year for me. Autoimmune issues? Lymphoma? I have chronic health anxiety, but I also know there is something wrong with me too and I can't find medical personnel to really help me. The medical is seriously lacking in my area. My really great young Dr. quite her practice for whatever reason. Leaving me in the lurch. So I have been seeing her nurse practitioner and though I like her. I feel like I am forever making an appt and feeling like a hypochondriac because my issues aren't resolving and it's always something else. Now I have this weird chronic itchiness. I have arthritis, and crappy skin. I don't feel I can get any medical help. It is depressing that I have to start all over and find a new Doctor and try and bring them up to date with all that is me and all my medical issues. This all over itchiness is driving me insane. I don't want to mask it, I want to know why it's happening. This is only the itching icing on the crappy symptom cake that is me. Some symptoms are chronic (long lasting or recurring) and worrying. Some are shorter term. I am sorry for the lengthy whining rant."

The headaches are so do unbearable , I usually get them around period and ovulation time if I was still having a period. The whole head seem to hurt especially in the sinus area and around the back of head. Along with the headaches I am so weak. I thought I would be feeling better since I'm getting closer to menopause but I feel so depleted of hormones and so aged. Does anyone tell me why I'm having these headaches? I've never had headaches before until the past few months."

amy67442,2020-05-27T15:43+00:00,Spotting Day 6?!,"Hi all, Sorry - this might be long! I am trying not to freak out over this, but the horse might have already left the gate! Back at the end of January I had a bit of a hemorrhoid flare up. Within a few weeks, my whole GI system was in a turmoil. I was seen by my GP who wasn't overly concerned because I had a clear colonoscopy 2 1/2 years ago (because of the hemorrhoid situation). She gave me some Bentyl for the gas/pressure, diarrhea and told me I could see a GI if anything persisted. Well - Covid came into the picture and although I have continued to have GI symptoms, it is virtually impossible to get an appointment with a specialist (especially because I live in Massachusetts close to Boston). Back at the end of March, my primary tried me on Lyrica because she said it might help with the GI symptoms as well as calm down my nerve endings in my ""nethers""! I did feel some relief, but my symptoms came back about 2 1/2 weeks ago. I have since discontinued the Lyrica. Now to add to this, I started spotting on day 19 of my cycle and have been for the past 6 days with no period in sight! Also, the past few days, my right ovary also has a bit of an ovulation feeling. I am 44 and know this could be all part of the peri process, but I am an illness phob. My mother and grandmother both had endometrial cancer (albeit postmenopausal), but I'm just freaked out I have something like that or worse, ovarian cancer given the GI symptoms. I'm literally losing my mind. I did manage to get an appointment with my gyn for Friday, but if anyone could give me some words of encouragement or wisdom, I'd really appreciate it!"

And we're here to support each other through the journey. Women in my family took a long time to get to that 12 months marker. It appears my younger sisters and I are on track for the same. They are 57 and 58, still cycling. My oldest sis went to 58. My mom went to late 50s. I win the prize. 61 and still counting. ( GASP!!) On 7th month now with fingers crossed. Hysterscopy and ultra sounds are normal. I do have a huge fibroid but dr is watching but says it's shrinking. I don't want surgery unless necessary. So...what are the age ranges here, if you don't mind sharing and how long have you been enjoying peri??? I can look back now and see that irregularities didn't begin until i was 50."

I was sitting at my desk when the room started to spin so I quickly dropped to the rug so I didn't fall. It probably lasted a minute if that.... It is now the next day and I feel light-headed and a little dizzy. I know I need to increase my water for drinking everyday. My husband took my blood pressure as soon as he came in to the room and it was normal. My pulse was normal as well. I guess this is a new symptom? Does anyone else get dizzy or room spinning vertigo episodes on the first day of their period? My periods have gotten very short (about two days in length) so I know I am slowly getting close to menopause. In addition, I have been dealing with these peri symptoms for about five years. (I am 48). I ordered dramamine and read benedryl can help as well with dizziness. Any other thoughts or tricks to feel better? I just feel so alone with these symptoms as none of my girlfriends say they are having any. Thanks."

lana26181,2020-05-21T16:30+00:00,My problem with 36th menopausal symptom out of 66,"Hello ladies, Few months ago I developed odorless vaginal discharge, no itching or irritation due to it but visible. It is whitish yellowish and sort of slippery, not really a lot, some days without it completely, and then it always comes back. Again, has no smell at all. My gyno ordered vaginal ultrasound, which was normal, and she said that my uterus is actually little too thin ( which is supposed to be good thing, but indicates severe lack of estrogen). I have been on topical estrogen cream which she told me to up, but it did not help. All my Pap smears so far were normal, thank God, and my HPV is negative. I am not sexually active. So, I just want to see if other ladies may have notices some increased vaginal discharge, and if they were told by their doctors why it happens. I am 58, at least 5 years w/o period, and, needless to say, suffer from almost all other Menopause symptoms. This , however, bothers me, because it persists. Any piece of advice is highly appreciated , and maybe similar experience. Thank you in advance and stay safe!"

A few years ago my periods went from 28-30 days to 19-23 days. Lasting on average 4 days. I have always had very heavy and clotty periods, so that never changed...until these last few months. My period in August came on day 29. It lasted 7 days (with days of spotting after) and was light. Then for the next few months they were back to being heavy and anywhere between 23 and 34 days. I am now on my period and on day 6. Again, light but hanging in there still. I almost feel like it's a period leading up to a period. Does that make any sense? I almost feel like it won't stop (also, tmi, but when I poop it seems to make it heavier). I just feel bloaty, pelvic heaviness/soreness, gross, my boobs are tender now (instead of before), and just uncomfortable. And of course my anxiety is flying high. Has this happened to anyone else, and how long did your period last? I know it's normal for periods to go haywire and have read quite a few forums where periods last weeks, but I hate change.

And oddly the rest of my skin doesn't look super dry. I'm getting my thyroid checked and since I live in San Diego trying a shower filter. My current filter is cheapo so I got a $50 speciality one because they said we have chromium in our water and ammonia. My bathroom sink water does sometimes smell funky so I called the water dept but haven't heard back. Praying that is the cause, but then I have been living here for 7 years so not sure why would bother me more now unless water got worse or my skin just got fed up. I haven't changed shampoo or anything. Still using Revita shampoo this androgen blocker that was helping my hair shedding until the last month or so when it started up again. I just got my period so still in peri. Any help or ideas ladies? I'm going insane. I'm terrified to wash my hair because the shedding is like a horror show every morning. And if I don't wash it, it's even worse the next day. Now worried about things like alopecia tho know when else in my family has it. Wonder if there is such a thing as a hair dermatologist that takes insurance. Don't want to do minoxodil because once you start that you can't stop. My hair is still growing, it's just shedding like a mofo. And then the itchy burning scalp now. Thanks ladies for being out there. 😦"

I have all of the signs that my period is going to come, but it hasn't, so now I feel stuck with terrible PMS symptoms: agitation, anger, and frustration that is just off the charts.

NothinforNothin,2020-05-05T22:10+00:00,What do you Ladies think......?,"Hello Ladies: So peri hit me a year and a half ago. I had extreme vertigo, anxiety, panic attacks and depression. I was very sick. Scared to leave my house. Went to my primary who prescribed meds for anxiety and depression. I needed them for sure at that time. On my 3rd med now maybe 10 weeks in and it was the only med to start to calm me down although, I paced for a year and it never helped that. Finally realized I had swelling near my left ear on the back of my head. Read that the inner ear could be causing the anxiety, depression and vertigo. Called my primary who prescribed an antibiotic, a steroid and claritin this past week. Now since on this treatment the pacing has finally started to stop after all this time. So, I think all along it was my ear. My vision is still somewhat blurry. Had that too when this all hit and had to get new glasses at that time. I'm still blurry though somewhat. So my question is. If it's been my ear this whole time. Would you try to wean off the meds to see if it's just the ear or would you stay on the meds? I don't even know if it's the Lexapro making my eyes blurry but, I'd think after 10 weeks that would clear up. The last time my doctor said if I went off them my symptoms would come back and they did but, now that my ears are treated and that may very well be the cause. I don't know maybe they won't come back. Maybe my vision will clear up. Although also, I haven't hit menopause yet. Don't know if I should stay on the med just in case because this peri was so severe for me. I'm just at a loss. I'm not looking forward to weaning off this either and I'd like to do that before I start a job. Whenever that is because I still can't function due to my vision and still some anxietydue to that. What would you do? Thanks...been a long horrific road with this. I'm thankful I've narrowed it down but, I constantly feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. ❤️ Thanks."

kylie01267,2020-05-07T08:39+00:00,Hypertensive Crisis,Have any ladies out there had a hypertensive crisis? I had a colonoscopy Tuesday and Wednesday felt dreadful. I had a CT angiogram booked but couldn't get it done because my heart rate was too high. When I got home from the specialist which is an hour from home I went straight to bed as I felt unwell. By the time my husband got home from work I was feeling pretty rotten so he took me to the ER. I felt extremely nauseous and felt warm all over and like I could pass out I honestly thought I was going to die. My BP was 186/139 so I was put in a ressuss room which scared me even more. My BP eventually went down but not to normal levels. I am medicated but my BP has been high over the past couple months. I am off to the doc again in the morning for another check up. Over the last couple of weeks I have felt off with light headedness and that rocky boat feeling and I had that light crawly feeling on my face. Has anyone experienced this I'm wondering if this could be due to peri menopause or I may have had a reaction to the anaesthetic?
heysandri,2020-05-02T13:05+00:00,I am 23 and in menopause since 5 years now and it sucks,"Hi everyone, i am Sandra and I am a cancer patient. Since I am 18 years old i live with ovarian cancer. In two big operations they took out both of my ovaries and my uterus. Till I was 18, i did a lot of sport and had a grateful life, my life was just easy. But after the diagnose and all the therapie which included chemo my life changed complety. My body got to fight with the symptomes of menopause, sometimes I get nearly unconscious by heat waves. The last five years i went through hell. Now five years later I have hard depressions, a lot of anxiety and it comes and goes, I cant control it. I lost half of my hair, my skin looks like i smoked for 30 years, my emotions run wild, when i do sport i cry but i dont know why. I cry a lot. And everyday it feels like it gets worse and worse. I dont know what to do. I am hopeless because of all this feelings. I tried different ways of hormon replacement therapie and now i use Estrifam 2 mg. From all medis it works a little against the heat waves. Since two month I eat vegan and it helps a lot!! I dont want pity, I just need to tell someone because my friends dont know what I am talking about. If you ladies may have any ideas or natural therapie experiences or encouraging words, I would be thankful."

My sister and mother claim they never had this issue which made me feel worse. And my OBGYN said only 40% of women have this issue so lucky me, also made me feel defective. Then, I started using this special shampoo, revita and it seemed to lessen the shedding during the winter but now all of a sudden it's getting worse again. Not sure if change in weather or hormones are nose diving again. Question ladies, does it EVER stop and get better? Even after menopause? My mom still has a thick head of hair but again clearly I'm not taking after her and she also claims menopause was easy for her and she didnt go through it until 60. But she also had 3 kids and I'm childless. 😦"

I can handle everything else except the nausea, vomiting, depression and anxiety of perimenopause. I continually suffer. I had a few ""good"" days where i felt like my old self 2 months ago but now im back to this horrible ick that wont let up. I feel like my last choice is antidepressants, but i dont want to suffer through the long 2 months of side effects if they dont help (i cant take hormones....herbal or natural treatments did not work and ginger doesnt help the nausea) im not looking for any suggestions of other treatments i just want to hear from ladies who had the intense physical symptoms along with mental symptoms of perimenopause and they took an antidepressant and it actually helped. please i am desperate!! I just need to trick my brain into accepting the hormones (i know antidepressants dont fix the problem) but i just cant live this way anymore, im at the end of my rope and if i cant get relief from this i dont know what i will do cause this is no life 😦 Thanks!!"

bettybetter,2020-04-25T17:36+00:00,41 early menopoausse? Femoston History of unusual fibroid- concerns. Help!,"Hi, Sorry this is quite long as my history of issues is complex. I have been struggling with my health for 6 years (when I was 35) it started with fatigue and headaches then skin issues (tiny blisters on face and rashes on neck & forearms) then horrendous bloating, abdominal pain and finally crippling back pain. After a lot of being messed around and overlooked by Drs, I was finally found to have a large chaotic and bizarre mass, which was removed in 2019. It turned out to be a pedunctulated fibroid (growing outside of uterus) which had partially degenerated and then became parasitic, attaching itself to my bowel, kidneys, liver, pelvic walls, absorbing blood and nutrients to grow. It also had a huge blood filled cyst. I was treated in an endometriosis centre as they thought it could be endo but none was found and pathology came back as a fibroid. The surgeons said they'd never seen anything like it. I had 3 months of GnRH analogue to put me into chemical menopause before surgery to shrink the mass and make surgery less risky. I had extreme menopausal symptoms with that- I could barely function. I had complications after surgery (severe anaemia and pneumonia & pleuracy) so recovery has been slow but I did improve a lot- back pain and bloating now totally gone. Fatigue has improved a lot- I could barely function before and now I can have a life. But, I still feel there's something not quite ok. I still feel sluggish, poor quality sleep and pretty much every menopause symptom. After the chemical menopause, my period returned and I am regular (though cycle length varies between 25 and 33 days and I was previously always 28 days). The menopause symptoms never fully went away after this and since January this year, they started to increase again and my fatigue worsened. I paid to get a hormone profile done privately and my oestradiol was low and FSH high. I went to my GP who said she'd test my hormones but they came back 'normal' though I don't actually know what was tested and what the levels were. I thought this seemed odd given my symptoms and the private test, so I paid for another private check this month and my oestradiol is literally on the line between normal and low and my FSH still high. My GP has prescribed me Femoston, which I've just started yesterday. I have no faith in Drs after everything I've gone through and this is a new GP for me- I wasn't particularly impressed with her assessment of me (I first went to her with this right at the start of the covid outbreak so she's probably super overwhelmed). I have a few concerns and questions, which I'd love any advice about... My history of having a very unusual fibroid and taking estrogen- I've read in the pamphlet that this is something to discuss with the GP- I brought it up and my GP had nothing to say about it and in the end I asked if I could be sent for an ultrasound to check whether I have any and monitor- she said she referred me but they won't be doing routine untrasounds under lockdown...so I am worried about this. Does anyone know how risky it is to take HRT if there is a history of troublesome fibroids? I'm also wondering if I've actually been perimenopausal all this time- since my issues started 6 years ago. Could going into peri cause my fibroid (which was relatively small back then) to partially degenerate and then grow the veins to my organs to survive my body's reduction in ostrogen? Underlying all my health issues, could it have been perimenopause all along? If I have been perimenopausal all this time- since 35 and having quite significant health issues as a result, should I be getting my bone density checked? I have a lot of joint pain which I've attributed to the chemical menopause but could this be issues with my bones? I know I have an unusual history but if anyone has any advice, i would be very grateful. thanks"

But in the past 2 months ive been having ""good"" days here and there when i feel like my old self (not enough if them tho) but then right after i have a good day BAM i wake up with intense nausea, extreme lathergy, depressed mood and awful headache....that will go on for 1-3 days then all the sudden i wake up normal feeling again....i can eat, absolutely zero depression or anxiety, no nausea tiredness or headache but it only lasts for like 24 hours at most then its back to my hell again. What in the world is going on with me!? Is it hormone related or is it mental illness i wish i knew for a fact cause then i would suffer through the months of debilitating antidepressant side effects so i could get more better days.

This is the second time i noticed this with hair dye. Just the smell sets off my symptoms. I had to open all the windows in the house to remove the smell. I am having to dye my hair but refuse because i am so scared because if the smell can put my hormones in such a frenzy just imagine what it could do to me if i apply it on my scalp. Has this happened to anyone if so are there any natural hair dyes out there ? Thanks"

Like a mid-life crisis mindset? This is so random, but I think about smoking a lot; like I want to get a pack of cigarettes and sneak off somewhere. It's weird!"

It's kind of sad to me that so many of us walk around feeling so rough, but are afraid to share it. I know I am! I'm scared people will think I'm crazy. So, can I just get some advice? My perimenopause hit me like a train. Literally the anxiety and depression were SO bad and they just hit me so hard. Mornings were the WORST. It's been 2.5 years and I have tried about everything. I will say that acupuncture seems to help some. I really think that it all started around 36? Even though I wore deodorant, I smelled like a teenager and poured sweat from my armpits. This has only gotten worse. Then I started with heavy periods. I literally thought I was having a miscarriage at times. Then massive PMS; super angry leading up to my period and then back to normal. What got my attention was the anxiety and depression (like a pit). I sometimes literally feel like I can feel something dropping off in my (does that make sense to anyone)??? Now, almost 42 (two weeks from now), I barely have a period (like 2-3 days) and I only wear a panty liner. It's more like spotting and brown. Sorry; I know that's gross, but I'm just being real hoping for help. The MOST frustrating part is that all of my levels are in the normal range (I think low normal, but still). I also have hot flashes. Soy seems to help me out some too. Does any of this sound familiar? Thank y'all so much! I promise if I had one wish it would be that all sickness (including hormone struggles would be OVER!)"
min73,2020-04-20T23:46+00:00,Crazy period?,"I'm 47 and I believe I have started perimenopause because I didn't have a period in Dec, had a regular period in Jan, no period in Feb or March but this month I barely spotted for three days and then I started my period and I've been on it now for probably a week, approximately 10 days total counting the spotting, which is odd for me because my periods were always 4 days long. Not only that but some days my period is so heavy that I've bled through to my pants. Today has been the worst with really heavy bleeding and I even had a fairly big blood clot. So far, the irregular periods are my only symptom. Although, I'm already on antidepressants so I could have depression or anxiety if I wasn't on it, I don't know. Is this normal?

I was just wondering if there is a link to this & peri as it started around the same time as my irreg bleeding & the steroid injection has not helped at all(it was assumed i had inflammation in the hip).

tracey56393,2020-04-17T14:13+00:00,Is this normal for Peri Menopause?,"hello ,i've had very heavy periods for probably 10 years now,i'm 51. They gradually got worse to the point where i could barely leave the house without pockets full of sanitary towels extra pants on and my Ruby Wuka period pants on aswell. So in September 2018 i had a UFE to deal with my fibroids, this was nowhere near as bad as i'd imagined,on my follow up appointment it had shrunk considerably and my periods were totally bearable,i' ve had a few heavier ones in between but nothing like it was before. From OCT 2019 i didnt have a period for 4 months ,absolute joy started the countdown felt like a new woman was having hot flushes which i totally embraced ,as i normally feel the cold horrendously.No hot water bottle all winter,then they stopped!! And i came back on again nothing major just like heavy spotting but its all over the place and no 28 day cycle .i go a week or 2 with nothing then 3 weeks light period its never ending. And spotting in between. And just as my husband and i embrace the old mojo returning .BAM its back again to put a stop to it. everything i read says perimenopause periods can become lighter,shorter, longer or heavier,longer between periods or shorter between periods,and then at the end if they last longer than normal see your dr.So is none of the above ok or not?? Im probably the only person who wants the menopause to come knocking! I want to start the countdown again!!!!! Does this stage last forever....."

Just really annoying as it begun more than a month ago and hasn't shown signs of leaving. Wonder if it is something insidious - corona, throat cancer, or maybe its a peri-menopause symptom. The fact that it is coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic freaks me out. I have had some coughing acompanying it, but I'm not sure if it related the sore throat or something completely separate. Either way, I'm scared. I will be calling my GP tomorrow to book an appointment to see him about this (if that is possible give the pandemic). Any ladies suffering with the same?

Puddycat,2020-04-15T16:55+00:00,Never ending breast pain perimenopause. ..help!!,My breasts hurt on the sides under the armpit every day for MONTHS. .. it never goes away it did for awhile but now it’s been back again for several months nonstop. I am 48 years old with heavy periods. I have suffered perimenopause for 9 YEARS! !! When will it end? ?? I have very heavy and long periods sometimes lasting 6 weeks of bleeding. This seems to coincide with the breast pain by the way. The months I had no periods or light ones I had no breast pain. Now the pain is back and so are the never ending heavy periods. I don’t want to take hormones or medicines etc. What causes NON STOP HIGH ESTROGEN? I mean if you only ovulate once then what would make estrogen continually release week after week? I have been tested negative for low thyroid prolactemia etc etc. So it has to be something causing non stop estrogen release because even after a period will end and all during I have the breast pain. It does not let up even during or after the period. ..just keeps right on till the next one! Do I have ovaries that won’t stop releasing estrogen or is this pain pretty normal for ladies my age? does anyone else have breasts that never stop hurting whether they have their periods or not? UPDATE: so I found out there is something called a LOOP which is when the ovaries are hyper stimulated by the estrogen to n produce another ovulation on top of the one which just occurred... so then you can have MULTIPLE egg follicles stimulat5ed growing and producing yet MORE estrogen for a cascading effect. I had non stop period for 6 weeks then a break for 4 weeks then now more period for 2 weeks so far and the breast pain which is a clue NEVER went away and still continues as does the ovarian pinching. So I'm guessing you just have to wait out the round of LOOPS until it finally dies down. Very awful and annoying. from what I've read basically in perimenopause there is a disconnect between the ovarian response and the brain pumping out FSH and other ovarian stimulating chemicals. so the brain never gets the message to shut off and you get continual ovulating which is why older ladies get twins so much! I hate this and I want my life back! !!

As if menopause isn't bad enough, I just got a call from my hubby's nursing home, they've been hit by the virus... I'm beyond terrified. My hubby has massive brain damage from an accident 16 yrs ago. He's a total care patient, meaning he can do absolutely nothing for himself, he breathes on his own but he can't talk or communicate in any way, hes given his meds and liquid food thru 2 different feeding tubes, he can't move, he wears adult diapers. He's had pneumonia over 50 times in the last 16 years and has congestive heart failure from having 2 back to back cardiac arrests after the accident, so to say he's high risk is an understatement. The home won't tell me if the employees that are sick handled him. He is awake and alert but trapped in his head, he smiles, cries, and responds to me and tries to talk, to no avail. I haven't been able to see him in a month bc of the virus and I'm beyond terrified!! My anxiety is taking over right now, I can't decide if the hot flashes are meno related or anxiety related. Since the call my bladder has decided to go crazy, I'm nauseated, the dizziness has hit a peak. My symptoms seem mild compared to a lot of you but right now I feel the world closing in on me. I've never felt my emotions going over the edge this bad, even when he had his accident like they are now. I've taken my nerve pill and it's doing nothing. None of my distraction methods are working. I was actually having a decent day until that call. Sorry for the long post, I don't have anyone to vent to since my mom passed 11 months ago and I don't want to worry my dad, hes not in good health. I'm putting my faith in the good Lord above, and could use some good vibes that my hubby doesn't get exposed. Thanks for listening! Please stay safe!"

I want to ask is this okay? by the way I am 26"
Puddycat,2020-04-10T07:22+00:00,Age 48 constant side breast pain both sides perimenopause?,"I have had this stinging breast pain in both breasts for 2 months now it did not go away during periods! ! I have been going through perimenopause 8 YEARS NOW. Including severe heavy periods, last period lasted 6 weeks and total of 2 LITERS OF BLOOD. So I am wondering. ... I know my FSH is high and my estrogen is not terribly high each time it's around 80 to 100 whether during my period or the end of it. I'm just so annoyed. 8 long years and I go sometimes 3 months with no period and no breast pain then suddenly 2 months of bleeding and 4 months of breast pain. WHEN WILL IT END? they say 4 to 8 years of perimenopause once you start to have close together periods but I had those at 40!!! Now I've had skipped periods for 4 years. Total of 8 going on 9 years of breast pain heavy periods dizziness fatigue heart palps bad sleep and other agonies. Are my stupid ovaries going to torture me forever? I want them to shrivel up and die. Ditto for my uterus which caused me to go down to level 5 hematocrit. A nightmare. Is it possible to have LOW ESTROGEN and STILL HAVE BREAST PAIN? ?? MOST articles say it's high estrogen but if it isn't then what the hell is it? I'm so annoyed. Worse still was going to my regular doctor to get tested for estrogen and Dr. and nurses coughed on me and I'm pretty sure I got Covid 19... not a joke. Very busy regular doctors office. Had a bad feeling going on there heard all the coughing and I thought don't go don't go but I was wanting to know my estrigen levels because of the bleeding issues. ugh. My body is torturing my and no one should have to go through all these symptoms year after year. I don't want to do HRT and don't want to do the IUD with progesterone. I tried the natural cream progesterone and HOLY GOD I was so messed up. Didn't stop the bleeding but it gave me terrible side effects heart racing dizzy low blood pressure and low blood sugar couldn't hardly stand up. Took 3 days to get out of my system so no thanks I'll just keep my own s****y symptoms bad enough I would wake up and lose half a cup of blood. Misery. 450 ml of blood in one period? Try 1600 ml!! And now with the stress of this lockdown just adds to the misery."

I have had so much gas and bloating. I'm so sick of all this! No matter what I eat I get gas or heartburn. If I don't eat for a long time I get gas or bloating. I wake up hungry sometimes, I go to bed hungry. It's a never-ending crazy ride. I just want everything to be the way it was. Thankfully I had a colonoscopy two weeks ago and everything was fine. But it seems like that procedure offset my stomach because it seems like the gas and bloating has been worse since the procedure. Have any of you experienced a lot of gassiness after this procedure?"

I do have diverticulitis and always check for bleeding which I haven't had. Lately I have noticed a small amount of mucus in my poop. Not a lot and it can be white or clear.

Reneehob,2020-04-01T01:55+00:00,All these weird feelings since I turned 50.,"Hello. In January I turned fifty and my whole life changed. I have never felt this in my head and body . About a year ago I would wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing . I attributed it to stress. In January when I turned fifty, I started to get Palpations and increased heart rate . My Blood pressure was a bit high even though i never had a BP issue . I saw my Pcp . They did all these cardiac workups which were all normal. She later prescribed a beta blocker to help with my heart rate and palpitations. I later started noticing i was getting ringing//fullness/pulsation in my left ear would also come with a weird vibration in my body . Sometimes I would think my Bp was high but it was been normal . In addition, I would feel as if my stomach/chest was vibration/pulsating . I would also get a pulling feeling in chest and stomach especially epigastric area . Because of all these feelings it is difficult to sleep . People tell you about common symptoms of peri/menoupause like hot flashes but never these symptoms . Because of these symptoms, i feel as if i am developing anxiety . Anxiety because i don't know what is the cause of all if this . I also saw my Ent who stated that I had a eustachian tube dysfunction however the ear symptoms should have gotten better already . I am now scheduled for an Mri of head focusing on my temporal bone to see if this is a middle ear issue . After reading some of the the comments on this site I am left wondering if hormonal changes can really cause all these feelings . I haven't reported any of this to my gynecologist as yet because I wanted to rule out ear issue first . Sometimes I feel like my family and friends may start to think I am crazy . I have never felt like this in my life and just want some relief from all these weird symptoms ."

Normal for menopause?,"Hi I've been in peri for a few years and noticed fatigue increasing and had sleep issues but recently I look in the mirror and I look as exhausted as I feel. I did have a heavy period that's now over but I feel like I can barely move so exhausted. Caffeine seems to make it worse. Then part of me wonders if it's coronavirus tho no fever or trouble breathing. Just feel so effin tired and my hair shedding is so depressing despite the special shampoo I use. The shampoo lessens it but doesn't stop it and sometimes like today, I get a big knot that falls out. 😦 If I could get my large fibroid out laproscopically I would try hormones.

I have a question, have any of you experienced swelling in your ankles and or feet during your period? I am on day four and I haven't had a period since January. Prior to that I went a whole 100 days without a period. Leading up to this one, my stress and anxiety had hit an all time high with this virus running loose and my kids being home plus the hubby is home too working from home. Usually when he's at work and they're at school, that's my ""me time"". Now, I don't get any of that. But all that aside, my original question was about the swollen ankles. 😂 It's only the left leg. I think I've had this before but every time a symptom disappears and then resurfaces without warning, it feels new. Can anyone relate?"

Guest,2020-03-29T16:25+00:00,For ladies who are suffering with this hell,"I have had a perfectly awful past year....the worst ever in my life. i have been in perimenopause for about 4-6 years now (hard to know for sure), I have been on here begging for advice on what i can do to ease my suffering and i was struck with a major realization today! So ive been SO sick to where i cant eat, so fatigued to where i cant function, so depressed and anxious all i want to do is cry, not to mention all of the other 20 symptoms i have, but this morning i woke up feeling ""my old normal"". I was able to eat with no knots in my stomach or gagging, i didnt feel depressed in fact i feel very happy at the moment, i went for a long drive in my car with NO anxiety.....i have wondered this whole year if im just plain mental and maybe ive slipped into the pit of of no return, i wondered if i did need antidepressants or vitamins to make this all go away even tho ive tried them in the past but they didnt help. But the truth of the matter is ive not taken any special vitamin, no hormones, no cbd oil, no antidepressants, no probiotics.....in fact i havent changed a thing. The realization i had is this IS all hormone related and nothing we do or we take will make things ""disappear"", this is simply how our bodies react to this terrible time in our lives. The best thing we can do is try to nurture our bodies and minds as we muddle through this terrible battle (i dont think of it as a journey this is plain HELL) we need to realize that we arent crazy and there is no special ""pill"" that will fix us. Im sure i will have way more bad days ahead if me until im completely through with perimenopause and once menopause is here maybe i will have more good than bad days, but at least i know now that i am NOT broken! Having a day or two here and there of feeling ""my old normal"" tells me that im still in this body somewhere and once the hormones settle i will find her again and i will be victorious and wiser for it! I hope this helps some of you ladies know that you arent weak no matter how bad you feel and you certainly arent broken, this is just our bodies way of fighting against the inevitable change we are going through! Bless all of you in your battles!"
loonarider,2020-03-24T19:37+00:00,Is this peri-menopause symptoms or COVID-19 symptoms?,"Hi all, I've been particularly anxious around this time of pandemic. I know that since being peri, I''ve had severe anxiety and doctor diagnosed me with panic disorder. I literally could be doing something relatively calm, or uplifiting, no stress and suddenly I'd get air hunger, chest tightness, my heart feeling like its about to stop beating and I feeling as though my rib cage is closing in onto my lungs. Now, of course hearing that respiratory issues inclduing shortness of breath is a symptom of COVID-19 I've been perplexed as to whether my shortness of breath is linked to that, and not hormonal as I've also get a tingling throat and mild congestion in my nose. I spoke to my doctor as our health service is not accepting patients at this time due to overload, so they are asking diagnostic question over the phone. My doctor came to the conclusion that I had recovered from a virus that wasn't COVID-19. I just now sure if I trust that answer, since I feel like I have a cold which hasn't shifted for 10 days now and with the shortness of breath, all I can think is COVID-19. But how to tell if its just anxiety or panic? Ugh, anyone else in the same boat? It seems unless I'm near deaths door or choking to death doctors will take you seriously at this time. Opinions appreciated. x"

I've tried all sorts of gentle soaps, moisturisers etc with not much luck so far. Also, have now developed an eczema type looking rash in my neck crease (usually the one that is in contact with my pillow, so worse depending on how I have slept), plus a blotchy patch on my chest, where I think the skin is touching when I am asleep on my side. Again I have tried all sorts of things for it, including anti-fungals, steroid cream, regular sheet changes etc. It looks pretty unsightly, like I've been sunburned, and obviously I am trying to sleep on my back but that's not going very well. Normally one to two hot flushes a night when I am pretty damp in between my boobs, so try to dry off as needed. I am very fair skinned, so this patch looks very obvious.Has anyone else had similar issues, and what did you do to help relieve it. Unfortunately I don't have limitless funds to keep trying different things and wondered if there is a simple hack that I could try? I am otherwise in good health,have never had any skin issues, and it seems such a trivial thing to bother my GP about in the current health climate."

(this can then go on for a few days/week at a time) Day 2: hot flushes on waking, zero appetite, temperature swings all day and all of a sudden too anxious to walk down the stairs (whereas yesterday was running down them in a rage whilst starving), raging tinnitus, itchy skin (this will usually only last for 2 days at a time before reverting to above). Zero libido. Completely calm and not raging or irritable in the slightest. Increased thirst. There seems to be no in-between here - it's either a Day 1 or a Day 2, and they can switch at the drop of the hat. My question is - on which of these days is estrogen at its lowest? Both days contain symptoms of low estrogen. 2 periods in past 13 months. Currently hitting day 100 since last one (prior to that had gone almost 300 days before 3 day period - you can imagine how welcome that was). Around the 200 day mark last time things improved significantly and ""Day 1s"" were few and far between. I know the classic symptoms of low estrogen so believe that the Day 2 example above is likely the lowest estrogen day, but can you still be estrogen dominant after years of skipped/missed periods? I know progesterone is likely to have pretty much disappeared by now but still - Day 1 seems very unusual for so few periods doesn't it? Especially the libido bit? Someone please correct me if I'm wrong!! Not on HRT. Just take supplements. Thanks!"

Guest,2020-03-23T15:44+00:00,Can menopause cause debilitating depression? Should I take Zoloft,"I know i have asked you all about zoloft before but im very curious if menopause can cause major depression along with that horrible anxiety? Ive never had issues with major depression (only seasonal depression in my past) but this menopause has brought me to my knees!! Ive lost so much weight, im so sick i cant eat, all i want to do is sleep (i use to have insomnia now its extreme fatigue) all i want to do is cry now, i dont want to leave my house, i have no interest in anything anymore. I know its major depression but i didnt have these symptoms this bad until i quit having periods (i thought i would feel better once they went away!) But im so scared to take zoloft, every time i tried to take in the past 4 years it made my appetite worse and made me feel sicker plus added other horrible side effects (and yes i have tried celexa, wellbutrin and paxil) i felt just as badly on them. I dont think it matters what antidepressant i take it will be very tough on me. But i dont want to take it if it isnt going to help cause then i would have to deal with withdrawals 😦 Anyone else have experience where the antidepressant helped relieve the hell from menopause? I know it wont make it go away but god i need relief or im afraid i will die of anorexia where i cant eat NOT cause i want to be thin. i cant even take my vitamins cause they make me very sick!"

Guest,2020-03-25T15:25+00:00,Bleeding Whilst On Femoston Conti....,"Hi, I'm new to this community and am looking for some advice please. I will give you a brief history, had to have ovaries and tubes removed end of November 2017. Anyway, pretty much instantly after op had the full on hot flushes which were awful but was determined to go without hrt. However, my existence was horrible, no sex life and just felt rubbish, by the way I am only 46. The hot flushes had such an impact on my life, found it hard to function and I almost broke down. So, end of June last year, went to the doctors and he put me on Femoston Conti. Within 2-3 weeks the hot flushes had almost gone completely, amazing. Every month I got a touch of a bleed and was told I would as I still had a womb, there was a couple of times where there was nothing and other times a lot more. Now I seem to be constantly spotting, more so when I've had a bowel movement. Went to doctor and he told me to stop the conti for 7 days and then to start the Femoston sequi. I am on day 3 of stopping and am still spotting but now got some cramping. Is this normal, did anyone else bleed non stop on the conti and whats the sequi version like? I'm panicking slightly due to bleeding but with the current situation am wondering whether it is important enough to get referred to gynae.....?"

I can get acid reflux for no reason at all, i continually get a gagging feeling in my throat (even if im not stressed or anxious), but the worse of my symptoms is almost daily nausea, loss of appetite, slow digestion, noisy gut gurgling, bloating and constipation. It is so bad now where i can barely eat!! When i do eat the next day i will have a massive stomach attack where im so nauseous i feel like i have the stomach flu, no diarrhea, and my tongue gets a white mucous all over it!! I have tried food elimination diet including dairy.....dairy is not a problem but i did notice granola and oatmeal makes me extremely sick when it used not to! I have been checked for celiac disease which i dont have. So my question us has anyone tried probiotics to help their digestion and did it help with nausea, food sensitivities and constipation?"

That went away, and I seemed fine until the next month, a few days before my cycle, the lump feeling came back. I would burp and it seemed to go away but would come back. This caused maoy anxiety, crying etc. Again it went away. Then I had this weird full ear feeling, eye twitches, every morning I wake up and i have this weird heart pounding tremor thing. My mouth is always really dry. Now the past few days I had this weird like canker sore like thing under my tongue to the back alittle. almost the side of my tongue on the floor of my mouth. Ofcourse I have to stick my fingers in there to feel around. yesterday it swelled alittle under my tongue, its red, i now have it on both sides under my tongue and a few tiny like either agrivated taste buds or tiny canker sores. Im sure I did this due to poking and such but now Im full of worries. What if what if what if. Has anyone had dry mouth and stuff like this with Perimenopause or Anxiety?

I have had more energy and it's the first med to start to calm my anxiety but, my concentration and focus is still off. I guess they say it takes btw 6-8 weeks to really feel the full effects. I just increased my dosage too so, guess it takes another 2 weeks for the side effects of that to wear off. My anxiety is still kicking my butt over a year now since peri hit. I can go grocery shopping but, I'm anxious just doing that. It's soooooo ridiculous and I've been pushing myself to do that for several months and it stays the same. I feel like my emotions are stuck and even with new experiences with people I see. I feel like I have memory loss. It's like I can't find my way home. I feel like a stranger stepping outside. It feels like I've lost my whole train of thought of who I am. Anyone on a meds and know how gradual this process is with improvement? Did your energy come back first and then your focus improved. I'm sure that is the case for most that have come out the other side of this. I'm just looking for encouragement because I've been in my house for so long. Some days I feel I will never get back to normal. Thanks for listening. I'm trying not to talk about it anymore and bother my family with it. xo"

One of the most concerning symptoms is heart related (or not). The doctors all know me at the hospital as I've been there many times, and most recently thinking I'm going into cardiac arrest, or something terrible to do with my heart and I'd keel over. Everything comes back normal always. So I am led to believe that what I think is heart issues is hormonal. The symptoms usually are shortness of breath, struggling to catch breath and this happens from the evening into the night, and especially when I'm lying down. I have lost so much sleep as I'm scared I will die in my sleep. Weirdly, I get a feeling like my heart stops, and then I panic and feel pins and needles in my rib/chest/diaphragm area, and a sensation like butterflies. Its odd and uncomfortable which also adds to anxiety. If this is all hormonal then I'm not sure how I can cope with this for how many years. Sometimes I try and focus on other things quickly and it dissipates somewhat, but still scary every time it happens and just wish it wouldn't. I don't want my life to be like this, I'm only 42. These symptoms are just one of many. I have crashing fatigue, bloated belly out of nowehre, lack of appetite, and when I do eat, I feel so full I can't breathe and my belly expands to pregnancy level, crying all the time, feelings of doom, everyday I think I am dying a horrible disease..I digress. What to do about the heart stopping sensation, it freaks me out and catches me off guard?. I also notice it comes on when I kneel on a seat, so I get up quickly. But for the most part it just comes on randomly. Argh, how to survive. Am I better of dead. I'm scared to go for HRT. 😦 Anyway help would be appreciated."
Takingtime,2020-03-07T18:32+00:00,Ovulation Pain for days,"Hi Ladies, I am wondering have any of you experienced an increase of pain mid cycle. I have always had this mostly on my left side for years, then eventually on my right, but it used to last a day or two at the most and it was more of a pressure pain and I could function in society. Now the last couple of years or so it seems to be getting more intense, it seems to be making my bowels spasm, and cramp and it now can last for several days, to the point of nausea. I have had several ultra sounds from 2016-2018 and everything seems normal and in great shape, but why such intense pain sometimes it radiates through the whole pelvis. My period pain is easy peasy little to no pain and it isn't sharp like this. So many women dread their period and I would take that over the midcycle pain any day. I am going to mention it again to my doctor, but seeing I have had normal ultra sounds, I am doubtful she is going to investigate further. I am just wondering do any of you find it getting worse as they get closer to menopause?"

It hit me suddenly (well there were signs before, but the extreme anxiety, heart palpitations) started then. The anxiety I feel is more of racing thoughts; constantly questioning things in my life (like my marriage) i.e. ""Am I happy?"" ""Do I love (fill in the blank)?"" I have to remind myself that I was very happy before all of this! I also go though old things over and over; like reviewing them in my head? I also have invasive thoughts which FREAK me out so bad. It's like I'm constantly lost in my head. NAC and B6 has helped tremendously as well as some herbs, but I'm just wondering if I'm alone in my anxiety. I also am constantly comparing myself to others. I hate the lack of confidence I feel. I also have depression at times, have had hot flashes, super dry skin, POUR sweat from my armpits, and acne (those are the most common).

jools2512,2020-03-07T12:16+00:00,fatigue,"Hi all, I am just coming up to 12 months period free, but over the last few months I have had increasing levels of fatigue with a voracious appetite. I also started a much more challenging job around the same time, so wonder if that is part of the problem. I have never slept well, so am quite used to waking repeatedly in the night and now am getting one or two drenching sweats most nights, sometimes with nightmares. My weight has continued to rise, and I had a new hip two years ago which is protesting with increasing stiffness and pain. I just haven't had the time or inclination to exercise. I am otherwise well with no other health problems and have a lovely family. I don't have problems with moods, but feel I may be continuing to spiral downwards physically due to the menopause. My question is would any supplements help me out, and how can I deal with feeling so hungry?"

Guest,2020-03-07T14:29+00:00,Vitamin deficiency the cause?,"okay so for the past 6 years my periods started becoming an issue....i would feel nauseated and have intense mood issues. As the years dragged on my estrogen and progrsterone began to drop, periods became irratic, i would suffer from loss of taste, loss of appetite, nausea & vomiting, sleep issues, anxiety, hot flashes, and huge weight loss even if i ate! I had tests done everything was fine except dropping female hormones but i never had my vitamin levels checked (my diet us terrible...high processed foods and rarely veges or fruits). So for the past 2 years ive only had maybe 3 periods very far apart and intense loss of appetite, nausea and weight loss, along with taste issues and mood swings. i am only 42 years old so its too early for menopause, but i finally had my vitamin b and d levels checked, they are low....my question is has anyone noticed feeling better once their low vitamins have been treated? The dr said those low vitamins can cause all those symptoms i have even the loss of my menstrual cycle! I have suffered for so long it will be a miracle if it was low vitamins all along and i can feel just a little better once the issue is taken care of!"

Oxytocin is the hormone responsible for love, bonding, and togetherness, and as I understand it, a lack of oxytocin is one of the primary reasons wives with severe menopausal symptoms often cannot stand their husbands, leave them, stay away from them, are hateful to them, etc.... So they are going to try replacing her oxytocin levels with an oxytocin nasal spray. The problem is that the pharmacist says the spray does not work well. i understand that her oxytocin levels should level out as the other hormones are balanced. in the interim, does anyone know how we can go ahead and replace her oxytocin with meds?? Know anything that actually works???"

A few minutes later and I'm back at 57bpm. I should add I'm not fit, just have a fairly low resting heart rate. Anyone else experienced this who's linked it to perimenopause?"
ali2597,2020-03-06T21:10+00:00,Hormone levels are borderline,"I have not had a period since 10/2012. Throughout the years I have been told that I was definitely in menopause. About a or two ago I had some spotting, no known reason, the past couple months I have had severe cramping and spotting after. I got an U/S, it said my endometrium was thick, had an endometrial biopsy, waiting for results. The blood work shows that my FSH level is 25.2, which is just on the border. So now I'm concerned there may have been another reason for not menstruating for 8 years, weight, diabetes, and that it's going to start up again, probably after I have the gastric bypass. Wouldn't a level of 25.2 8 yrs post-menopausal be too low a number? Any similar experiences?"

Never in my life have I had a uti, .my mom gets them often and bad, but never me , so also outside of hips/butt burn pain in the muscles.. Now the burning when urinating comes and goes over the past 7 days its not bad at the moment at all so was thinking great gone now.. But now since last night been getting a very sharp very quick stabbing pain on left side higher than belly button but lower than bottom of ribs what could it be infection? I don't have a uterus just ovaries oh and had right side ovary pain yesterday but just thought ovulation which is not unusual for me, just the other stuff is alarming.. Especially the stabbing quick pain has me thinking infection or pancreas or spleen.. Anyone else have these issues ? Please share.. I can't take antibiotics im allergic , so what does someone do who gets an infection who can't take antibiotics if this is an infection.. Will it eventually go on its own??"
HBPHD,2020-03-03T18:07+00:00,Perimenopause: A Husband's Plea,"Three months ago perimenopause entered our lives without warning. Two days before, we shared another of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of intimate moments spiritually, emotionally, and sexually as a very happy married couple. Two days later I came home from work to see that my sweet wife had abruptly left, having found and moved into an apartment the same day. No warning. No fussing. No discussion. No thoughts regarding whether we could afford it. Nothing. We have a very sweet marriage. We are both strong Christians, love one another, and are deeply committed to our marriage. She says she loves me and is committed to our marriage.... and that she only moved to deal with menopause by herself. While I believe her and trust her completely, and will stand by her side without fail, this is very difficult. Rage, crying, depression, anxiety, panic, memory loss, confusion, anger, removed from me, beside herself. Twenty four - seven, these are our new friends. And we hate them!! worse, they say she has indeed had a mental breakdown through this. On top of this, I had to move out of our house bc we could not afford two households. Now I am staying in a hotel trying to regroup. She somehow manages to ""show up"" at a very stressful 65 hour week job that seems to keep the medicine from working quickly. She has been on bio HRT 6 weeks, and the meds are not right yet. They just did more bloodwork yesterday to correct it. So we continue to suffer, especially her, but me also. I have read and heard of lots of ladies struggling really bad like my wife and moving in an apt only to move back home with their husbands in several weeks or 3 or 4 months, but when it is you, it really hits home. So, I know no one knows how much longer this hell will last, nor how quickly I can move back home with her, but can you ladies offer any POSITIVE insight as to how much longer it should take to get the hormones corrected and I can move home with my wife?? Thank you."

angie53015,2020-03-02T17:01+00:00,Perimenopause? Advice needed,"I'm 43 years of age and I think I have started perimenopause. Since Christmas my periods have been coming every 3 weeks and lasting 9 or 10 days, with starting off light for the first four days and then going heavy. I have always had a fairly short cycle, with my periods coming 3.5 weeks apart, but always lasted 5 days. This month they have started even closer than ever and have started with brown spotting. I am also spotting between periods. My GP organised for me to have an ultra sound scan which I attended and they said I may have a possible polyp, but as the lining of my uterus was thick they couldn't tell for sure. I have had a history of having polyps before and they never affected my periods. Another reason I think I could be peri is that I am having migraine type headaches when I'm on my period, plus indigestion and constipation. I constantly feel tired, my legs feel heavy and ache, I keep dropping things and my anxiety levels are through the roof!! I keep having this sense of doom, like something is seriously wrong with me and I won't be here this time next year. I really think I'm going mad sometimes!! I have been tested for thyroid, vitamin b12 and diabetes and they have all come back ok. On a more embarrassing note, my vag is dry and I dont want my husband coming near me, not that he can much as I am constantly on my period!! Luckily, he is understanding in all this. I just want to ask if anyone has had the same problem with their periods and if and how long it took for them to either go back to normal or start being further apart? The constant bleeding is making me feel worse, so if that can stop at least I can feel a little bit more normal again. My GP did say for me to monitor things and come back to her in 3 months. I am also trying agnus castus as I heard it can help regulate periods, but that can take 3 months to work, if it ever does. Any advice would be great."

This last period I had came on day 30, first day was very light then very heavy for two days, and then two days of a light period... my urine started to smell funny and now I have an UTI.

Takingtime,2020-02-26T13:51+00:00,Inflammation,"Good morning ladies, I wanted share some information.So I like most of you have been dealing with on and off symptoms that keep popping up. I have had digestive issues, headaches, bladder issues, night sweats, fatigue, cramps, etc....I have also dealt with back pain since I had my first child over 15 years ago. Over the last three years I have undergone so many tests, heart tests, ultra sounds, xrays, urine tests, pap tests....you name it. I have noticed over the last year that I am now getting more and more neck pain, shoulder pain, rib pain, and over all muscle pain anywhere from hips, to legs. I just ignored it because I felt they were just going to say it's stress or anxiety which is what I have been told in the past. I went to my doctor the other day as the pain in my right side has been on going for close to three weeks. She feels it is a pulled muscle, but the thing is I don't know what I did, she says often times this can happen with a pulled muscle you don't feel it happening at the time. Any ways I asked if she could check for arthritis and anything else that can cause pain, as I have not been able to work at my business lately. We are still waiting on one more test which is an autoimmune, but my blood test has come back with high inflammation. All this time I started believing it was all in my head because I was starting to feel that way, but clearly the blood test shows differently. My point is keep searching, don't assume its perimenopause, don't settle for stress and anxiety. I am going to keep searching for the cause of inflammation because I feel I can't be living with a chronic pulled muscle. At my age the inflammation should not be that high. I would suggest all of you that have chronic body pain to be checked for inflammation in the body."

I believe I do sleep 7-8 a night but still feel like s**t when I wake up. Every once in awhile someone will tell me I snore. UGH And the other night I guess I was yelling in my sleep but don't remember dreaming. Anyways, just trying to figure this out.Guess I need a sleep study to see if that's whats keeping me from good sleep. Those machines scare me.. Reading about how elevating your head may help-- There is a 'wedge pillow' online but gosh how the hell can I sleep on it-- looks so uncomfortable..

I have loving friends and family but no one can understand what I.m going thru so I really feel alone. Sometimes I.m okay and sometimes I.m not. Some days and moments are better than others but as soon as some of my symptoms subside and I feel more like my old more confident self then I.m knocked right back down again. I feel like if I knew all of this was normal and that one day I would get relief, it would be much easier to keep pushing, but that is not always the case. Although I have no idea what else could cause all this madness, I still cant help but think I have some virus, cancer or one of my organs is failing. Sounds so severe but so are my symptoms. I cannot do anything these days without all my symptoms flaring. If I stand or do any activity I start to get hot and everything gets red like my legs and arms, face. I start to dry out...dry eyes, lips, mouth, skin. Skin looks really dull. I start to breath heavy, have dizziness (whole body dizziness) and I cant think well, feel l.m drunk and in black hot fog. I also then of course have increased heat/prickly/itchy sensations, stomach starts to gurgle, loss of appetite, anxiety and depression. I can be hot all over but have freezing feet, hands and nose. All this keeps me from being able to live and focus on what I love. It's all so disheartening, confusing and scary. My mind cannot rap my mind around it all and days like today I lack perspective or hope that its temporary. How could such horrible symptoms and body changes be temporary and how long is temporary, 10 years?? Only my love for the old me and my children keep me going. I.m gonna list my symptoms below. Some are obvious as hormonal, some not so much, everyone says I.m too young for this at 41 😦 Hugs to anyone experiencing anything similar. woke up with dead arm Stinging heart Tingling all over body Skin tone darker Skin super soft Feels like bug crawling on skin Hemorrhoids /Fissure Excess saliva Burning up back Boobs deflated Dizziness, off balance, boat feeling Changes in taste, smells Blackheads on my arms Worse symptoms after standing Felt faint after standing Periods closer together, heavier Oil behind ears, forehead, b.w boobs Fingernail ridges Thinning skin Dull skin Changes in skin, blotchy, red...face red Burning eyes, tongue Cravings...orange juice, chocolate cheese Gastritis Brain fog Sick in the mornings Itching in pubic hair area Nerve pain at clitoris Leg muscle twitching, foot cramps Dead skin cells Muscle soreness Trouble writing/puffy hands Heavy breathing Popping/creaking bones Nostalgia Swelling, face puffy one morning had black circles under eyes Sensitive teeth Formication...burning, stinging, numbness Burning sometimes feels like indian burns Acne on back of neck Diarrhea/constipation Lack of focus Facial hair Feeling flat, no emotions Flu like symptoms Armpits smell musty, onions, only one side smells Feet freezing...feet, hands, nose and ears hot with cold patches of skin Hot/cold/chills Insomnia Allergies, allergic to milk Dry lips, mouth, eyes Watery, red eyes Eczema, rashes, hives Morning anxiety/anxiety/depression/panic attacks Thinning body hair, patches of hair loss legs/arms New hair growth Vibrations, thought was cell phone Hot flashes Flu like symptoms Indigestion Bloating Eye changes, blurry vision Nausea Hungry late at night"

My anxiety is through the roof! Its taking a toll on me! In December it all hit me like a ton of bricks. I felt like a had a pill stuck in my throat, It would move though front, over to the side, up down. Whatever!! I also kept getting waves of the Blues.. I would cry. Then Id be fine other than the severe Anxiety. I couldnt eat alot, as it would make my panic attacks worse!! Finally close to Christmas It all subsided, and I felt ok.... Late January / Early February the throat thing came back, lightly.. I was on dealing with it then on the 10th... I was having Breakfast with my husband at the Diner, and I went into a complete Panic attack. I felt like my jaw was locking up, my ear had this weird pressure in it. I had to leave the Diner.. Now it's been 10 days and I am back into the rut of panic, anxiety. When I wake up, Im ok. I sit up, I then get a clogged nose, Ear pain or whatever it is. Also had this weird eye twitching.. The throat thing comes and goes. Depending on the day, I have blues or waves of sadness. I feel like Im going CRAZY. I hate all this. Any suggestions for me? I am having a really hard time eating. I tried to eat last night and then thought I felt pain when swallowing food.. I dunno, I anticipate it all! I am scared to death of getting sick. I have 3 wonderful children, and a wonderful Husband.. I shouldn't have all these emotions! Thanks in advance!"

On better days and moments I think about the meno boards and how one day I.m gonna be able to come back and help others. unfortunately I fear I.m a far way from that. Last week I had some terrible anxiety, dizziness and heat before my period. I literally used ice packs 2 nights before it started. The relief was awesome once it started but it never lasts but a day or two and I.m right back to a hot, anxious mess. I.m on BHRT and it helps but sometimes my boobs are really full, have bloat and it is no cure. I saw accupuncturist yesterday and it was quite an experience. She doesnt believe in HRT due to, all the hormones in our food already and wants me to go vegan. I eat pretty well, but I eat a lot of chicken. Because my symptoms are so severe and I still question whether I.m dying of something else, then I feel guilty foe not trying everything possible to help myself. But I dont know how realistic it is and food is one of my few joys these days. She brought up my liver and spleen with some of my symptoms and now I feel like I have a failing organ or will get cancer if I dont change my diet which mostly already consists of fruits, vegetables, rice and chicken. I do indulge sometimes with a little cheese and chocolate which are cravings since peri but I do eat pretty clean, just not vegan clean. She also believes that trauma contributes to our illnesses and wants me to work thru some of that which I.m totally on board with but with just surviving thru the day at this point so anything more is really draining. The session didnt really help physically with anything that I can tell. I.m also taking herbs and so will see of that makes a diff. i will go back for a few more sessions tho its not cheap but I want to really try all possible to help myself. When I did it years ago I got emotional then as well.just It seems to be a form of spiritual release for me, just too bad I cant afford it weekly and am not ready to make the lifestyle changes that should come with it."

About a month and a half ago, I decided to stop taking my birth control after being on it since I was 20. Then, about 2 1/2 weeks ago, I woke up and my hands were so stiff and so painful, I couldn't make a fist! I also had numbness and tingling anytime I raised them, like when I brushed my teeth or tried to dry my hair. My grip seemed weak as well. This has continued for the past 2 1/2 weeks where getting ready in the morning is awful! Even driving with hands on steering wheel is awful! I thought it might be carpal tunnel syndrome, but why would that suddenly hit overnight and in both hands?! Then my joints began to hurt more--I have a slight history with arthritis in my right thumb and in my left knee, but now I feel the pain in my elbows, my wrists, and my feet! Also, more joint popping noise! After reading several posts on this forum, I'm pretty sure this is due to stopping the pill and my estrogen levels dropping. I just refilled my prescription and I'm praying that once I start the pill again, these symptoms will go away! Anyone else experience these symptoms after going off the pill? Thanks in advance!

rhomo,2019-11-14T16:42+00:00,"Prickly sensations legs, neck, face","Hello. I've read several posts and am relieved that I'm not alone in wondering if my nerve symptoms might be related to hormones and menopause. I am in my early 50's and had my last period 1.5 years ago. About a year ago I started to get sharp, prickly sensations that started in my neck and thighs, then progressed to many other areas - including my face, arms, feet. The sensations come on many times daily, and seem to be very random. I also had some episodes of numb feeling in my face, which would last an hour or so. It was pretty scary at first, came out of nowhere and a bit more intense at first. After 6 months it seemed to become more low grade, but now has increased in frequency again. I've seen my family doc, 2 neurologists and had an MRI of my head. All normal. I also have a health care background and realized that the symptoms really didn't match any typical neurological pictures. I was told by the neurologists it might be due to some type of infection, which may be the case, but I started to seriously think about my shift in hormones. I've been trying to stretch daily, and do a lot of walking, just trying to stay healthy and positive but it's hard to ignore these symptoms when they occur so frequently. I see some others have had the prickly sharp pain. It would be great to hear how long it lasted , did you continue with your regular activity, and did you find anything that helped?"

Have seen a cardiologist and blood work has been done. No red flags. Am due to get and echocardiogram in January just for baseline. Blood work was fine although now diagnosed with HBP and put on a low dose to control it. Was anxious about that but all seems ok there.

I now have to examine everything down to the minutest detail, obsessively check reviews before buying anything, and can't leave the house without doing 10-15 rounds of checks to make sure everything's turned off, doors are locked, etc. We're in the process of buying our first house so deciding on paint colours, utility providers, etc, and it is totally stressing me out. Every time I think I've made a decision I'll read something that makes me change my mind. I can't seem to make a decision at all. It's taking all the enjoyment out of what should be an exciting time, and I'm totally fed up of me so who knows what my husband is thinking. So can I blame this on peri, or is it just me being neurotic and lacking confidence in my decisions (in which case I'll have to give myself a massive kick in the butt and sort myself out)?"

Namely, I sometimes have stool leakage that I am not aware of at all, until I go to the bathroom! Thank dear God, at this point it is really little, but I do not understand how can that happen when a person is not aware at all of any need to go to the bathroom? Less then two years ago I visited rectal surgeon for this and he examined me and said that it happens very often with hemmorhoids because your bottom apparently cannot close properly. He did the procedure where you burn internal hemmorhoids and I was really fine for a year... but now it started happening again, and it may be little worse. Years ago had colonoscopy which was all clear, and a year ago I did DNA colon cancer screening test which was also negative. But, this issue bother me very much - there are days and days that it does not happen, and then all of a sudden I have to wash myself twice . I cannot see it, thank God, on my panties or anything like that, but when I pee now, I am in the habit of wiping my bottom too, and sometimes there will be little stool or traces of it on the toilet paper - and sometimes it is little bit more that that. If anyone experienced something similar, please share your story, and maybe a piece of advice if you have it. Maybe I should visit the doctor again? It also gives me additional anxiety, from which I suffer as it is."

My right hip started aching last few weeks like toothache, I had xray on knees and Dr said mild wear and tear but the thing is the aching is generating either from my right knee up my thigh to my hip or other way round. hands also especially thumbs, my shoulders ankles im so fed up with feeling 90 😭 if its mild wear and tear why do i ache so much so surely this peri is making it worse and creating more pain areas.

I don't have bloating, just feels like inside is dry or something. And what can I eat that can relieve this constipation. Does anyone have this dry feeling, along with constipation? Also, from my mid 30s, I would be sweating a lot when sleep at night and feels hot, just a few days prior to period. This hot does not bother me that much, just the constipation is really what I want cure for. The doctors here are useless, won't even want to help and they are all men. Any answers/suggestions would really help. Many thanks."

I also was on day 5 of period when this started. My period is over now. Have any of you had this before and what have you done or meds taking to help. I have pretty bad health anxiety so that's not helping either. Any feed back would be appreciated.

I am so paranoid, last week my left eye was watery and itchy due to allergies but I kept thinking of the worse I can't stop worrying about every little thing. My mom has been having stomach ache for a few weeks now, she went to the doctor, they did some x-ray, she has bad constipation which is the cause of her stomach pain but I can't rest my mind, I am thinking of the worst scenario. To add fuel to the fire, her right side mammogram results came back, they want to repeat her mammogram to see things clearly and to make sure all is well. Now my anxiety is sky high, I am so restless, can't focus on work or kids or anything. I find it hard to cope with stress and anxiety. Does anyone else feel this way? I really pray hard to get me through this difficult days but need your support as well. Thank you for listening 😃."

I'm 53 and stopped a birth control pill back around May of 2019. Because I kept having a monthly period, fairly heavy and a friend of mine told me she stopped hers (due to medical reasons) and she quit having a monthly.

It's like my brain while in the car is moving slower than the buildings I'm passing and I feel confused on roads I've always driven on with people. Is this just a normal symptom of peri? Is this what the off balance does to you? Is it due to the dizziness causing anxiety which is making me feel as though I have memory loss? I've had a huge issue with feeling grounded and unsure of where I'm literally standing since this hit. Honestly, I feel like I have amnesia and I'm out of it but, I don't remember myself before this happened. Maybe I'm not calm enough yet to realize what is going on.

I have experienced pain in my hands, bilaterally, only at night or prolonged periods if nonmovement, for over 2 months. Every single night, each time i move, my hands wake me up. They seem to be stiff and difficult to move, and when i try to move the fingers, the pain is enough to make me cry out. After flexing the fingers various times, each time i regain a bit of flex and each time the pain lessens, until, after 6-7 flexes, the pain is almost gone. Fall asleep... repeat. Every night, all night. I have seen an Internal medicine doctor for this; rheumatoid factors normal, inflammation markers normal, everything normal. except it isn't. They have referred me to a rhuematologist but the appointment is a month away 😦(( Please tell me someone else is experiencing this, it is menopause related, and they've discovered a way to stop it!!!"

I'm so exhausted from trying to get out of this. 😂😂 I was never anxious before this hit! Anyone on buspar for anxiety? I heard many take Lexapro too and it helps.

Juliagmcc,2020-01-22T21:18+00:00,Nightmare Peru symptoms made worse by hrt.,"Hi ladies I have been in peri for the past 18 months. Night sweats, palpitations,anxiety all made worse by HRT. I was prescribed Novofem and took it for a couple of months. I noticed after 3 weeks that I was feeling alot worse so I was put on Estraderm 2 x 25 mg patches due to shortage of 50mg and then to take Utrogestron tablets day 14 to 28. After one week of patches feeling even worse really agitated and anxious so I took one patch off which didn't make me feel much better. After having panic attacks and breathless on doctors advice took the other patch off. Doctor said could be producing antibodies to the HRT Feeling much better but still having palpitations. I am already on 20mg of Citalopram since April 2019 which seemed to help for a while. Does anyone have any experience of herbal / natural supplement. Worse symptoms are the anxiety and palpitations. Look forward to your advice."

I have had wonky vision and menstrual migraines since then, but no auras. Tonight, I was watching Taskmasters on my iPad and the faces seemed a bit off. I instantly went into panic mode and within a few minutes an aura started. It was zigzag and colorful and formed a large C shape in my left eye. I tried to calm myself, but admittedly it didn't work. I cried as my bp skyrocketed and stood outside in 40 degree weather trying to take deep breaths in the dark. I am so upset. I thought what happened to me a little over a year ago was a one-off thing. Or, at least I had hoped it was. It took me months to try to overcome my constant fear of an aura. I went back to work amd was being independent again. Now, I feel like I am at square one again.

amandaharri,2019-07-12T22:05+00:00,Perimenopause CRAZY Symptoms!,"About a year ago i was feeling really low, and was feeling really strange, i went to the docs and has handed anti-depressants, i felt like i was going crazy, little by little strange symptoms started to happen. Firstly headaches and a weird pressure feeling in the head and behind the eyes, my first thought was OMG I've got a brain tumor! i had other weird symptoms starting all around the same time, dizzyness fatigue, weight gain, red face, hair loss, a buzzing sensation which feels like shivering but you cant see it, which is more noticeable at night, and lots more disturbing symptoms! I really felt bad and felt alienated as no one could see what i was going through, i was at a loss. I kept going to the doctor and had blood tests for everything i was told, which came back with nothing, like usual i was told it was stress, (yes i was stressed because no one would believe my symptoms) After that i started to get very depressed thinking i had a terrible illness that had been over looked, as i was just 43 i thought i was too young (as told by my doctor) for perimenopause. Not long after this we moved down the road and i luckily could change my doctor, and thank god i did, i got a understanding doctor this time who listened to me she took in to mind all of my symptoms and sent me for blood tests, a week later i got my results.... I was perimenopausal. I read somewhere on this site 66 symptoms of peri and i had nearly all of them! It just goes to show you if you get a second opinion you will get there in the end, my first doctor didn't test me for the one thing that was causing ALL of my symptoms, had they i wouldn't of had nearly a year of worrying myself crazy! I think there should be more warning of menopause, a leaflet through the door when you hit 40 and not just of the basics but of all the symptoms, it would stop a lot of unneeded time, nhs money and stress on a subject we dont talk about, i mean its a lot worse than puberty and they teach you that!...also doctors should take you seriously if you think thats what it is instead of patting you on the head and giving you anti depressants! I might have years to come of 'peri' but at least i know now what i have wrong, i have an appointment for HRT, i will keep you posted of what happens and the ups and downs of my journey... look after yourselves and i hope this post helps you"

I felt like I was going to rupture. So earlier today I felt like I had to go to the bathroom, frequently before I go I get a stomach ache, then severe nausea, it all went away, but I never went to the bathroom. A couple hours later I was laying down when the ""ovulation"" pain came, and then really bad cramping, like when your period starts. So twice in three days, can't help but assume something is wrong.

I just found out I have significant arthritis in my right knee. I had x rays today on my right knee because the pain has been so bad that I can barely walk at times. I started on glucosamine with msm a couple weeks ago and it has helped but I am 51 and feel twice my age. I know it is in my left knee and the rest of my joints but not as bad as my right knee. My right knee makes crackling, crunching noises and it is hard to get around especially later in the evening. It is so depressing. The horrible pain started about 3 weeks ago. I have a referral to a sports medicine Dr at Andrews Institute. But really what can be done? Surgery? Medicine? And on top of that I am having spurts of pounding heart coupled with anxiety. Just enough to make me feel like I am going insane or dying. I know I have to lose about 40 lbs and my joints would probably feel better. But I am struggling with weight loss. I really feel hopeless. My husband is on a business trip for 10 days. I have no friends or family within 800 miles. I have my dog, my arthritis, my right lower eyelid twitch and my slowly decaying dumpy body. I can't even stand to look at myself in the mirror. Sorry for being so negative. It is really hard to get out of the lows when I am there."
bev27429,2020-01-16T00:41+00:00,Feeling Sooooo Frustrated and Exhausted!,"I just came off of about six days of feeling well: happy, energetic, optimistic. Life felt easy, and I had everything in perspective. Now, I feel crazy again and mentally fragile: I shift from feeling so angry that I could scream (and I do) to moments where things seem tenuous but OK, to little blips of peace here and there. I am expecting my period, but I am at the stage now where it starts, then can stop for several days or a week, before it actually begins. I have gotten a period after just 17 days, and the longest that I have gone without a period is 101 days. I turn 52 this year. I know that my hormones are in chaos, which is why I feel the way I do. I also have the physical signs, such as bloating, where, no joke, I look like I am in my final trimester. It is super obvious because I am thin and tall. If anyone can relate to my situation, please respond. It would be so nice to hear from others and to get some reassurance."

Keljo48,2019-02-15T15:44+00:00,Postmenapausal with breast soreness and pain for about a week and a half.,"I haven't had a period since October 2017. So I am post menopause had horrible peri menopause symptoms. It wasn't abnormal while I was having periods to have breast tenderness. But this is worse and intermittent. Both breast with ache/hurt/pain. Sometimes one will ache or only a part of one breast will ache and then the other will do the same. It is mostly my right breast I had a horrible upper backache with it yesterday. But so far today it is just both breast ache and feel sore. It is the breast muscle, not the breast itself and my nipples do not hurt. I just changed my bras to without under wire. I switched to a smaller purse. But I don't think that is it. I am really worried about this. I have an appt with my Dr's FNP tomorrow morning. I have to get a referral to get my annual mammogram for this year. All my past mammograms have been clear. I don't expect to get much answers on a Sat morning. Probably will request blood test, etc. I am so tempted to go into the ER just to get the ball rolling. I am miserable and trying not to stress. I don't even know what to expect with post menopause. When I look it up on the internet, it seems I have either breast cancer or cyst or some other hideous disease. Ugh. I know peri-menopause this isn't abnormal but post??? Anyone else post menopause with this issue?"
cindy_45475,2019-03-03T20:55+00:00,Good to know I am not going mad,"Hi all. This site was my saviour when I had frozen shoulder so I do not know why it has taken me this long to. join the menopause discussion. I have read several posts and it has made me realise that I am not slowly going mad or indeed about to die of a dreadful illness. I am postmenopausal I have not had a period for around 4 years. I have in that time suffered with frozen shoulder in both sides which i strongly believe is associated with hormones (although many people ; mainly males; think not?) I have had terrible pain in my ribs and suffered with a 'popping' sensation where I thought my rib had broken from just turning over in bed. I had blood tests and xray and all were negative so I asked the doctor could the symptoms be related to hormones? His response was to laugh; and say no, however no further medical reasoning was given. I turn 51 on Tuesday and this is the first time that I feel my age; feeling at that invisible stage; I feel unattractive and of little use. I am starting to forget things; and my skin / hair are suffering. The hot flushes are coming more frequently; I have totally lost my sex drive and my eyesight has greatly reduced. I do try and remain positive and exercise each night; I have changed my diet which I feel is making a difference. I do wonder if I will ever feel normal again ? i haven't resorted to any medication as of yet but i have started thinking about HRT but I have heard the scare stories too, so it has put me off. if anyone has any advice or feedback I would love to here from you. thank you Cindy x"

Just wondering if anyone knows if this means anything like they are about to end completely? My symptoms are so much worse and the only thing that brings me any relief now is my period. If they stop I feel I will be stuck in this state of despair. I had begun to be able to manage my symptoms and then my body once again becomes my enemy.

Like I go to bed at 7 or 8 and barely can get my ass up at 9 (luckily I work from home). Is this another joyous part of dying hormones? Yet in the middle of the night I'll wake up feeling super anxious with a rush of heart racing. No sweating just the anxiety. Am I alone?"

Guest,2019-09-04T00:58+00:00,"Nerve Entrapment - pain in hands, arm and feet","Hi, since going into menopause my hands, arms and feet have ached. Nerve testing of the arms showed the nerves were being trapped in the cubital tunnel (elbow) and also the carpel tunnel (wrist). Fortunately this pain has come and gone with intensity over the last 3 years. The Drs answer is surgery but as I believe it is directly related to menopause I am reluctant to do something permanent for what could be a temporary problem. Does anyone else have experience with this and did they find it got better with time and/or did they find anything that helped lessen the nerve entrapment."

NothinforNothin,2019-12-31T01:18+00:00,What would you do?,"Hi all, I'm now one year and one month in with Peri. I was hit hard by severe anxiety and panic attacks when this hit. I had blurred vision for about 6 months. Dizziness 9 months or so and some days it still hits me. I had that spaced out drunk walk for a while and still find myself swaying at times although the severe anxiety and panic attacks have calmed with 2 supplements I'm taking. My fatigue is still terrible. Seems my adrenals are so low. I'm taking a Nitric oxide supplement right now to help with blood flow for circulation along with Pro Estro. I still have some memory cognitive issues that feel like brain fog or depression caused by that. I'm still having trouble focusing. I swore off HRT because my mom died 5 years after taking it from cancer of the lungs from it and I watched her suffer and die from cancer. So, I'm so scared to go that route but, I'm just home literally waiting for this to pass. I can grocery shop. That's about it because I still have anxiety but, my fatigue is still so strong. I'm not fully alert or present in the moment. Are you home waiting for this to pass and how are you handling that because I'm feeling the guilt from not being able to function. I have a very supportive husband and he's willing to wait for how long it takes but, I'm scared this could go on another year and I'm so over this. Scared too because I haven't even hit menopause yet. What would you do? I'm just feeling so overwhelmed by this tonight. My blood work is normal. I go to counseling for this too but, it does not seem to help. I was led there at first for anxiety and depression like most but, it's peri. Just lost right now. I try to keep positive but, this is so hard. Thanks ❤️"

The past three months for me have been dreadful.....I just can't stop burping all the time; its like there is just so much gas in me. I've seen a specialist and he told me not to worry about it however it just will not stop. Any suggestions on how to relieve this? I also have terrible pain in my neck; shoulders and ribs; and such tight muscles; have been seeing a physiotherapist however it just does not help. Wishing you a lovely evening and all the best for 2020.

NothinforNothin,2020-01-11T23:57+00:00,Question re: peri/meno,"Hi all, I'm just wondering. Anyone with peri symptoms of severe dizziness and anxiety finally wake up one day and both stopped? How long did it take for that to happen? I'm talking when you couldn't function or work due to it and then finally you could. Was meno easier for you after or was it also, horrendous like peri? I'm trying to way options on how long I'm going to wait for this to pass. I'm really stuck. I know everyone is different but, wth does this end and how many go through worse symptoms once in meno or sail through because peri was the only thing that hit you the hardest. I just bought cbd pills today too add to my collection of supplements. Hoping this helps in a matter of days. Praying actually but, that hasn't seemed to help. I'm calm but, can't shake this anxiety!!!!! I can't take HRT. I feel screwed. Just being honest. I'm usually positive and encourage others with this but, I'm now losing my positivity."

How will we all feel better if we have no estrogen , progesterone, etc. left.I guess it is all of the highs and lows that create the discomfort. Do women in the late 50 and 60s feel much better? I'm sure there will be a whole host of other issues but just feeling normal again would be nice. Thanks in advance."
joann1972,2020-01-09T16:14+00:00,Weightloss,Hi Ladies - Just wondering if any of you have experienced weight loss during perimenopause. I over the last year gained about 8 lbs but have noticed over the last month or so I have lost it (without trying). I am an extremely anxious person and its usually very hard for me to gain weight so was surprised when I gained 8 pounds in 6 months (I am thin and only weighted 118 and now back to 118). Not sure if it is something to worry about (God knows I don't need anything else to give me reason to worry). My anxiety has been very bad these last few days and now that I have weighed myself it's giving me major anxiety. Thanks for any response you can provide. I swear this stage is going to drive me insane.
anxiousface,2019-06-08T21:08+00:00,Do you analyse every feeling,Do any of you lovely fellow suffering ladies analyse every horrid feeling you get because I've noticed im getting worse and i go through this every day or is this just anxiety i really don't know anymore.

kelly55079,2020-01-12T16:58+00:00,Progesterone and weight loss,"I may have to try Progesterone for my heavy periods. Had a D&C months ago as Dr thought that could help. It hasn't yet.But I'm really nervous to try-- I don't want to gain any extra weight. You would think by now someone would've created something to do both--- female issues and weight loss.. My mood is ok but certainly could be better.. What I'm most angry about is these heavy periods and dealing with the mess. I feel trapped.Exercise helps with the way I feel. I do get headaches BUT not all the time and I really believe it's due to the weather because I cannot pinpoint them. Years ago they would come about 2 days before my period monthly. So again, not even sure I need to try Progesterone. Has it helped you for the better?"

Klp77,2020-01-07T10:37+00:00,Facial fuzz - to remove or not?,"So one of the most obvious signs of being someone 'of a certain age' for me is the gradual (over the last 2 years or so) increase in the amount of facial hair I've developed 😔 Thankfully the majority of it is very blonde (apart from the random dark ones that appear from nowhere overnight and are suddenly 2 inches long!!!!). I've always had a very fine covering and have had to deal with the upper lip situation since being a teenager, but I now have a very obvious (to me anyway) thick covering of blonde hair in the beard area. Hubby says it isn't noticeable (but then he has been on the receiving end of more than one hormonal rage in recent years so you can't blame him for perhaps being wary of telling me like it is). My questions to you lovely ladies are: When does 'peach fuzz' become too much and needs to be dealt with? How do you deal with yours (if you need to)? I've looked at the Flawless Finish type thing, the No No, the diy scalpel type razors, waxing, threading and dermaplaning. The first three I don't fancy the stubbly regrowth. Don't think I could handle the pain of a full face wax or threading (getting the top lip waxed in bad enough!!) and dermaplaning is just an expensive version of the first three. So do I just accept it and count my blessings its blonde, or grit my teeth and find time to defuzz every few days to get rid of the stubble?"

After a lot of researching I believe they are called Ice pick headaches where you feel totally fine then from out of no where you get a jolt feeling in your head with a squeezing sensation. To me to me it seems to come around the time of my monthly but can stay for a few days after my period. The pain only last seconds and seems to be in the temple and forehead area. I am going to see my doctor in a couple weeks to bring this up, and today I am going for a massage for the first time as I have very tight neck and shoulders due to poor posture. I do also have muscle spasms in my face, more like twitches, which I have had for many many years, and take magnesium daily.Not sure if one has to do with the other. I also have TMJ but have had that for many years."

alexandra15854,2020-01-07T19:00+00:00,Sudden adrenline surges/pressure waves/body jolts/brain zaps(?),"Hello from Berlin! I am in the midst of menopause (I am 51) and have these terrible, terrible ""adrenaline surges"" or ""pressure waves"" that start suddenly from my upper body and shoot like a wave to my head. Then I feel a sudden, short lasting pressure on one of my ears, then one of my ears rings for a few short seconds. I feel strange for a second, not really dizzy but ""turned off"", as if someone had dimmed the current inside of me for a moment. Then everything is back to normal after a few seconds, my heart races, I feel shivery and cold and have feeling of panic. Sometimes these waves are very mild, sometimes they are extremely strong and during these my whole upper body makes a quick jolt or jerk to the front. Its as if current travels very quickly through my body: sometimes I even feel my toes and fingertips tingle at the end of such a rush or wave. Sometimes I don't have them for weeks, then again I get many, many in a row during one day. Today I had seven of these! I have been to many doctors these last years but no one really knows what it is: the say its either menopause related or due to my taking a Benzodiazepine every now and then a few years ago (NEVER on a daily basis!), or it might be due to my constant underlying anxiety. Does anybody know this, has experienced this??? I would be so, so grateful for an answer. Alexandra"

I'm so over this phase of life, I've never hated being a woman as much as I do now, I'd take back debilitating cramps and heavy flow over this hell any day! I've been dealing with so much emotional crap since my mom died back in May and since August I've been fighting yeast infections and oral thrush after a round of antibiotics. I was using creams to clear up the yeast and then the AV rears its ugly head and I double up on my hormone cream.. get it all sorted out and boom another one, I'm on my 5th round in just 3 months!! I was put on mycelex lozenges for 10 days for the thrush, did no good, 15 days of nystatin and eating yogurt (literally choked it down bc I hate it) dropped all refined sugar and carbs, new tooth brush every 3 or so days, followed all instructions to the letter, did no good at all. Started on fluconazole today, and this stuff does not agree with me at all which is why I use creams for vaginal yeast, but I'm desperate! Right now I'm dizzy as h^ll , nauseous and my hands are tingling and this is only day 1 of a 7 day treatment!! My anxiety is in over drive, which is only making the side affects worse. I just can't function any more... I have to push myself bc I have zero desire to be productive let alone be around people (and I have my aunts funeral on Thursday 😢). I'm 51 and feel like I should be in that coffin.. My white blood cell count has been high for several years and I've been worked over by an oncologist but they can't find a reason for it. However, I'm not being taken seriously about the hazard in my community.. we have radioactive waste that's in the creek that runs thru my backyard and a landfill a few miles away with 1000's of barrels of it illegally buried there from the Manhattan Project. Our lawyers (class action law suit, our houses are worthless) told us to inform our doctors of the alarming cancer clusters and rare cancers in our community and the doc act like it's nothing. It makes me wonder if all the crap I'm dealing with on top of meno has something to do with it 🤷‍♀️ . Anyway, besides one lady who has been giving me great advise, has anyone else had bad side effects from fluconazole? please tell me it gets easier during treatment! I just can't deal with this! Sorry for the long rant.. I'm at the end of my rope and had to vent before I go outside and scream my head off!!"

Has anyone first experienced anxiety when Peri hit and how long have you been fighting to get out of it? I go out of my house for errands but, I'm always scared to venture off the beat path which I had always been able to before this hit. I'm so miserable. Just home cooking, cleaning, playing video games to help with focus. I first had the memory issues. That has eased. I'm no longer putting my clothes in the dryer to wash them! The brain fog and depression is slowly lifting. I'm thankful for that. Everyone just keeps saying to keep busy and it will go away. I've been doing this for so long. If your suffering with this longer then me I really feel for you. Is this normal this long if the severity of your anxietyfrom peri was this high? I'm taking black cohosh and pro estro to balance my hormones, dhea, vitamin E, B6, drinking soy milk, sleeping right. Just ordered some passion flower and Bach flowers. Something has to break this.

Rklnv,2020-01-07T18:18+00:00,I can’t get any answers about how I will feel in menopause,"I am 52 years old and am in perimenopause now. I started my period at about age 14 and had completely normal, problem free periods for over 15 years. At age 28 I suddenly got severe PMS two weeks before each period and periods became late every month. With the start of my period I would be relived of PMS symptoms. My PMS consisted of extreme frustration , irritation, unstable emotions, and binge eating. Physical problems would be water retention and sore nipples. About a year into that I was put on Medroxyprogesterone 10 days before period was supposed to start. I would say it only helped to make my period come on time only sometimes. About five years after that, my doctor tested my hormone levels and found that I had a high Estrogen level. They found some cysts on ovaries and one on right ovary that was a complex cyst. I had that removed and it turned out benign but ovary was destroyed. Estrogen level went down only a bit. A few years after that, I started putting on natural Emerita Progesterone cream instead of Medroxyprogesterone. By this time I was in my early 40's having used the natural progesterone cream for several years and my period finally became normal coming on time and what seemed like to me, not taking so long that I would be suffering with PMS. So I had no PMS most of the time. If I did it was very mild and brief. Fast forward to age 50 and horrific PMS started all over again. However, my periods were always right on time and even early since my 40's, so I did NOT want to mess with my hormones by using the cream which I had stopped using years prior since I was on time. The even stranger thing is that PMS got longer and would be three weeks out of a month long. My last period started and I never stopped feeling PMS and here I am today having been suffering all this time and now my period is late by 4 days and I have gained 10 pounds from feeling famished and frantically over eating/ binge eating, and my nipples have never felt so painful! I literally feel like I am pregnant at 52 years old. Newer symptoms, from what I believe is perimenopause added to my PMS is severe anxiety, strange thinking, and increased paranoia. So I have some questions that I desperately need answered. All these years I just assumed that I had Estrogen Dominance and either the progesterone cream helped and my Estrogen levels subsided with age also and that's why I balanced off, and now with perimenopause my hormones are out of balance again. Okay but question 1. why is it so extreme for me?. And 2. ( and most importantly,) Does menopause, ( and the way I will feel for the rest of my life,) mean that I will feel like this and pregnant forever??"

The first two days I spotted, but then the 3rd day I started bleeding pretty heavily. That was yesterday. I am still bleeding moderately to heavy. I called my doctor and spoke to the nurse who talked to the doctor and then called me back. She said based on the size of the polyp that the level of bleeding I am having is not abnormal. But man it seems like a lot of blood. Has anyone had this experience? If so, I'd like to hear about it. Thanks in advance."

They were coming every two months. Now since last October I haven't had any periods just brown spotting. I had an ultrasound done last month on the 21st. I go back for my results on Saturday. This is the longest I've gone without a period. My question is this, is the brown spotting a normal occurrence after you stop seeing periods? I've had the spotting in between periods before but this has been going on for a few weeks."

Samalamb,2020-01-04T18:43+00:00,Looking for information and advice regarding bioidentical hormone replacement therapy,"Good day - I'm new to this site. I'm also a northern Canadian girl that lives in a small community accessible by plane or train only. I say this because most of our stuff is shipped in and doctors (especially specialists) are difficult to access here. Anyways, I'm living in a world of hurt that started nearly 7 or 8 years ago. I'm going to be 50 in 2020 and been perimenopausal for FAR TOO LONG! lol! My first symptoms were super scary - it was my brain. I was forgetful and feeling almost crazy because anytime I'd express this, people would say, ""Ya, that happens to me all the time."" What they didn't get was I was actually a very intelligent person that prided herself on her memory and being astute. At that time, I couldn't remember things like my husband throwing a birthday party for me and the attendees. I found it scary. Of course when I finally went to the nursing station, I was beside myself. I was complaining of that as well as sore breasts and a whole host of other symptoms like night sweats. Well she got on the horn to the doctor and I have no idea what the heck she told him but he wanted this girl to take a crap tonne of antidepressants. I do not want to go down that road because I've been there done that (suffered severe postpartum after my last baby...they wanted me on them for life - I was like NO WAY. I want to feel the highs in life and those robbed me of any genuine feeling). So fast forward a near decade and now I'm get my period every week or two. I've seen a OBGYN and he suggested endometrial ablation. My problem with that is I would need to travel 3 days for the consult and paper work, wait for the O.R. booking and travel again for the operation. It would be in a community where I don't have any support at all. I quit smoking a year ago, have taken up exercise in earnest (which if you knew me, you'd know I was desperate to get through this with my marriage and family intact). I happened on this and read somewhere that someone was trying biodentical hormone therapy but didn't catch how it worked or if it was worth a try. At this point I'm ready to try anything. I've been eating and craving chia - Not sure how healthy that is. I don't know. I'm grasping because anyone in my own family that I might talk to - mother, sisters, cousins etc. have all had hysterectomies so they haven't gone down this dark path. I am looking for ANY advice...ANY!"
Rainbow976,2020-01-03T22:40+00:00,Venting,"About 6-7 years ago it started with low libido, random hives after otc meds and/or eating and lots of hair shedding. 3 years ago this month after turning 40, all hell broke loose with additional, varying and terrifying symptoms no Doctor ever can assist with or even just say ""probably hormones "" so you at least don't think you are dying. 2 years ago digestive issues so bad I lost 10 lbs, which is a lot at 5'0. This summer the weight started coming back and has not let up despite regular exercise, yoga and a pretty healthy diet. Every time I step on the scale it is higher, now over 130 lbs and overweight. Not sure if it's dry weather, allergies or low estrogen but my sinuses and throat are so dry and sore, there's blood when I blow my nose. And today 1 eye is twitching nonstop and I feel adrenaline or my blood moving thru my body after a bad night of sleep. At 43 I just can't understand any of this...hormone and general labs always ""normal "" yet I am literally falling apart. Am I going to be a balding, fat miserable b***h the rest of my life??? I wish my husband could spend a week in my body so he could have a glimpse of what this feels like.I feel horrible for my rage or silence because I don't want to say awful things to him, surprised he is still with me. I only resemble a normal woman or myself a few days a month now. Sorry for the long post, I have made so many positive life changes in the last few years and nothing is helping. Why is this so hard for some of us and for so many years? Is there a central nervous system or endocrine ssystem issue doctors just don't know about?"

Anyone have input or experience being safely on long-term HRT or hormones from peri on? Thanks.
ty73345,2020-01-02T23:28+00:00,Post menopause Estradiol high,Hi I am 50 yrs old. I had my last period in Aug 2017. In Oct 2019 I bled for 3 days with moderate cramps. The bleed stopped but the cramps have not. I went to ER and utz showed endo thickness of 5.4 with the cut off for post menopause being 4. Since then I have had a failed endo biopsy w/ perforated uterus. The thickness is now 6.9. My estradiol result was 104 pg/ml with a reference cut off of ❤️0. I now have to wait to see a gyn on 01/28/20. Does anyone know what their estradiol results are? Is this hyperplasia?
NothinforNothin,2020-01-01T19:27+00:00,Memory loss,"Hi Ladies, is anyone having memory issues since Peri hit and has anything helped you? Other than taking HRT or antidepressants. Is there anything else? Sleep is improving this issue but, I don't know how long I'm going to have to sleep until this ends. I don't feel like myself and I can't move and react to things like myself. I assume it's from the severe anxiety and panic attacks I had which has since eased but, I can't seem to shake this issue. I'm watching my son play a video game and it's hard for me to absorb what he is saying while watching him play or visa versa. Yesterday for the first time in months. I picked up my camera to look at pictures and I was slow to operate it and I've had that camera for years. I know how to operate it but, it's like I'm looking at it for the first time. Although, I know that while this is happening! Things each day are starting to slowly I mean slowly make sense. Is this the stage when you are close to coming out of this nonsense? I have calmed down a lot since this hit last year and I can now sit in somewhat peace now without pacing due to anxiety but, this remains. Praying for us all. Happy New Year to You all! Thanks so much."

At 52, and not having had a period for 18 months, I was suffering terribly with night sweats which woke me on the hour, I was totally sleep deprived and unable to function at work. I was also depressed and had absolutely no interest in sex. I can honestly say that I have not had one hot flush either during the day or night since taking it, my mood is balanced and I can't get enough sex! My weight has stayed exactly the same and my only compaint is that it is a bit expensive. I will certainly keep taking it for as long as I am able, I have done my research extensively and have found no reason to stop."

I am tired of going to the dr for every little new symptom and I usually get more information on here so please tell me is there anyone else experiencing this particular symptom? Another thing is after not having a period for two months I had a very heavy one and have been spotting for two weeks since. Not sure if this has something to do with it.

james35414,2019-12-24T15:05+00:00,Unsettling symptoms of late....!!,"Greetings to all. I am a 51 yo female somewhere in the midst of either the approach to or the actual ""change""....periods have been heavier and somewhat irregular for about 2 years now, increasing irregularity past several months. My question is more on some (perhaps) unusual symptoms I have been having recently.... Upon awakening I have been intermittently experiencing a strange vertigo/tinnitus for a short period of time--it is hard to describe, almost like a pulsatile sensation in my head (but not regular, i.e. timed with my pulse) where my hearing and my perception are sort of muffled,,,,almost like my head is a radio trying to tune into a station--that sounds weird, but it's kind of hard to describe the sensation. This ""pulse"" happens intermittently every 5-10 seconds and appears to be self limiting when I am fully awake in 15 minutes or so. Not painful but unpleasant, makes me a bit nauseous. Been having a hard time referencing this as possibly attributable to hormones, unlike my other Fun Experiences such as eyes as dry and painful as a cracked bone, constipation, and zero libido. My other differential is that this weird symptom is autoimmune, there is a lot of these types of disorders in my family, it has occurred to me I may have Sjogrens as I also have peripheral positional numbness and some other symptoms that are c/w this. Just seeing if anyone else has experienced the strange ""radio"" symptoms, or if it's likely something else....thanks!"

Then I get confused and restless and dizzy. I get shortness of breath and muscle spasms on my right chest in my right groin and I feel like I’m gonna have a tremor or something or a seizure. I can talk but I can’t answer questions too quickly or at all. I get really thirsty. Just an overall spaced out scary feeling. When I get up I feel disoriented and I can’t feel my legs. And less about 15 minutes. i’m really hoping it’s menopause because I had a MRI and they told me I could’ve had a spinal cord stroke or the blood vessels are blocking the air from getting to my brain. The thing is I’ve had MRIs before and it doesn’t seem to be that much worse. I’m getting more MRIs but I just can’t believe That’s what it is. I think I’m having a heart attack or stroke or seizure. I’ve been in and out of the hospital in and out of doctors offices and had 1 million tests. Please share whatever you can to help me because I’m really losing it.

I am so depressed and i don't know how to come out of it. Just seeing others celebrating the holiday makes it worse, I want to do the same but i can't because of these symptoms daily."

I have been living on the nutritional drink boost for months now but i weigh 89lbs!!! I am wasting away....perimenopause is killing me! I feel like im seasick constantly, when i do try to eat it makes me terribly sick! Now i have no desire for food at all (even when i felt bad food still sounded good) i have been finding myself depressed cause i actually wake up in the morning just cause i want this hell to end!!! i dont have a life anymore. My day revolves around waking up dizzy, nauseated and no energy. I am wanting to take Zoloft cause at least it numbs me into a robotic state where i dont care that im sick and i go about life in autopilot. My only trouble is starting the zoloft, the start up effects are brutal!! I have tried zoloft 5 times in the past 6 years, i normally cant make it past day 40 cause it ruins my appetite but it lifts my depression/anxiety. So how long did nausea & appetite loss last while people took this?"

I was lying down feeling okay and then all of a sudden I felt a cold sensation starting at my head and going right through me. I haven't had that kind of thing for ages, but it's the same today.

Gigi368,2019-12-09T06:23+00:00,Anyone else?,"Hello lovelies! Bear with me on this bc I have no idea what's going on.. Back in Sept I was on antibiotics, about a week after my last dose I got a raging yeast infection which took 2 rounds of treatment to clear up, thanks AV! It took a while for my Estrace cream to start working again. About the same time I noticed some changes in taste and thick saliva (I know gross). I ignored it bc I had no other symptoms so just chalked it up to another silly symptom that would pass. Well it hasn't and it's gotten worse. I have a white coating on my tongue, not thick but noticeable, it burns and sometimes tingles and in the last couple days my tongue is getting fissures in it and the roof of my mouth is sore. I've been rinsing with warm salt water to no avail. I'm wondering if I have thrush from the antibiotics? Or some kind of mouth cancer, I know that's most likely my crazy meno brain talking but scares me none the less. Its driving me insane! I hate yogurt but bought some plain no sugar kind and coated my tongue with it, seems to burn more now. Anyone else have or had this problem? I have my well woman check and my regular physical next month so I was trying to hold out but I'm not sure I'm gonna make it. I may have to make a trip to Urgent Care.

charcey97,2019-12-21T15:46+00:00,Extreme forgetfulness and language issues,"Hi ladies- I know we've talked about the language issues before, but things are starting to worry me a bit. My 45 y/o perimenopausal brain doesn't seem to retain anything short term these days. You know when you walk into a room and forget what you were doing? This is me several times a day, even within seconds from one thought to the next. I can forget 2 or 3 separate thoughts within the same minute. I barely recalI memories that have occurred within days or weeks (unless they are something memorable...like holiday gatherings and such). I mean, I can remember we did the event, but specifics elude me . I recently tried to study for an exam and had such a difficult time. I had to write things down over and over and over to retain a fraction of the things I was supposed to. This is totally unlike me. I used to be able to read something maybe a couple of times and then retain it. My speech also seems to be worse. I confuse my words and choose words totally inappropriate for the context. Sometimes, I'll say a word that ends up being totally garbled from what it should be. I had a partial hysterectomy a few years ago, so I know my hormones aren't functioning at an optimum level. They seem to fluctuate frequently. Is this from hormones? Has anyone else experienced this? Did you end up getting better after getting through it or getting on hormone therapy that helped? I feel like I'm losing my mind, and I see 60 y/o's that can remember more than I can!"

jaxx02045,2019-12-16T22:39+00:00,How do I know if I'm in perimenopause? Could it be contributing to my anxiety problems?,"My periods are lighter and shorter than they used to be but that change has been so gradual over the years I can't even pinpoint when it started. I also get more cramps than I used to but nothing terrible. I'm 45 so I would guess that I am in peri? The reason I ask is that recently I've been having a lot of symptoms that I've attributed to anxiety that I was having over, ironically, my health. But I've had instances of health anxiety in the past and it has never affected me as bad as this time. I don't see any sort of monthly pattern in my symptoms but could it be that my hormone levels sort of helped the anxiety take hold and make me really sick this time? I've got a lot of the symptoms that people describe on here: headaches, nausea, dizziness, internal vibrations, weakness, twitching, etc, for almost three months now. I've never felt this crappy in my life."

jessica60993,2019-12-15T19:59+00:00,What is Anxiety ? How does it make you feel?,"Happy Sunday ladies, I always hear the term ""anxiety "" as a symptom of menopause. I even diagnosed myself as having it sometimes. Others have said I have it as well. However, I know many symptoms can take form as other things. So with that being said has anyone had a diagnosis of anxiety? How does your body feel internally when it surfaces? What are the thoughts in your head when you have an episode? Lastly, what do you do during an episode to control it? Are you on medication or are you doing something else to calm it down? I am taking rx flonase and I notice sometimes when I use it I feel a wave of nervousness about 5 minutes later. Its weird. Other times I spontaneously feel nervous, rapid heartbeat but i notice when i get stressed or worry to much I feel anxious. Menopause takes on so many different feelings, forms and experiences because of the inbalance of hormones its very frustrating at times. I am trying to focus on de-stressing and having harmonious thoughts because I am learning where the mind goes the behind follows.... 🙏🙏🙏 for all of us going through the ""change""... Best to you all, jessica❤"

But today (actually just in the last ½ hr) I seem to have a new symptom - DIZZINESS. Never happened and it is scaring the daylights out of me. I have been prescribed Provera 10mg for the last few months (16-25 days cycle) to get rid of the last of the bleeding before I enter full menopause (hopefully), but the journey has been anything but smooth, but I have tried to come here several times to get solace. Now with this new symptom, that too so close to the holidays, everything will be more or less closed starting Friday till new year, so I am now worrying if it is something serious, what do I do. Of course I can go to the emergency, but what if it is just nothing? I am being so contrary 😦 What I am hoping any of you can answer is...is it normal, how do you cope with it? I have not been sleeping well the last few weeks (another present from perimenopause) and have been having carpal tunnel in both hands with pain/tingling several times a day.

I am almost 40 and last year in november I did a medical abortion because i thought i am too old to have a kid and too scared. I was supposed to take some oral contraception after the abortion, but my mind and body were very uncomfortable with them and i stop them after no more than 10 days. then, a few months later I started to have shoulder pain and feeling very very tired, emotional and a mess. i was going to the toilet to wee 20 times a day and 5 a night and during day time having the feeling i ll pee on myself. i did some blood tests, an ultrasound of my shoulder and they said I have bursitis. it was not confirmed by the pyshio and the blood testscame ok, except iron and low vitamin d. i took them for 2 months and i felt better. in july the pain was all over my body, hand, elbow, palms, fingers, shoulder and neck. it s like a terrible muscular pain, ad i have made a great physical effort. but it s every day for months. i was cheched for lyme, reumatoid arthritis, cushing, hashimoto, lupus and all the other auto imune diseases. my breast from August are big, painful and the left one looks way biger. the elbow has sinovial liquid and i have the carpal tunnel syndrome symptoms. one doctor suggested a few weeks ago that my pregnancy termination and the fact i did not take the contraceptive pills for at least 2, 3 months made a mess in my hormonal balance. the pain in my joints, muscles is like burning me every day, my pals also burn like crazy. i cannot sleep more that 3 hours a night. the gynecologyst told me that i have fibro mastitis and told me to take femicur for 3 to 6 months and i ll get rid of the breast pain. i started to take evening primerose oil and to massage my breast with cold pressed castor oil. i started to take an oral contraceptive to supply my body with estrogen and progesterone, even if I am aware of the risks. i ll keep on eye on my breasts to make sure i am not going to develop other crazy things. i think i declared war to my body making the medical abortion and started an early perimenoupause. any advices? i have all the 66 symptoms and more. my hair and skin are dry, i am crying a lot. my sister prescribed for the pain lyrica and its helping me a lot. i feel like i am having sometimes electricity in my muscles. anyone with any advices or going through smth similar?"
AnthonyJaxon,2019-12-13T10:05+00:00,Weight Gain & Menopause?,"I'm 49 and finished menopause about a year ago. In the past 1.5 years I have put on 43 lbs despite eating less, exercising the same and not making any other changes that could affect my weight such as medication. The only consolation in this is that prior to gaining all of this weight I was very thin (100 lbs) so I look 'plump' rather than really big but at 5' 3"" tall, 143 lbs is really not a healthy weight for me. My thyroid levels are fine and all else is okay. I know that metabolism slows down (gradually) as people age but I think that 43 lbs in under 2 years is a bit insane. I have not gained additional weight but am having a hard time losing it. Has anyone else found themselves gaining a sizeable amount of weight during perimenopause or after menopause? Second question: I am not on HRT but am considering it. For those who opted for HRT, did it cause weight gain? That is about the last thing I need right now."

laurie19311,2019-12-08T18:30+00:00,The crazy symptpms of perimenopause....,"Hello beautiful ladies! I know all of us are on this sight for a reason...our crazy and at times unbearable symptoms! I kind of wanted to reach out and let you know my symptoms so some of you feel less alone and maybe a bit less crazy (although I think it's too late for me, lol!) Here is my list and I am sure I will be forgetting some! -Exhaustion! Ladies, I feel like I am walking through mud. Some days even the littlest things make me feel like I climbed Mt. Everest!( I take all my vitamins including iron) -Insomnia...I sleep maybe 4 hours at the most -Weight gain..I have gained so much weight, and I haven't changes my eating habits. Exercising is definitely difficult at this stage, but I have been taking walks and am hoping that will help. I feel as long as I am eating right, drinking, and taking my vitamins, at some point the weight will start to come off. -Anxiety..Oh goodness, this has to be one of my worst symptoms. I have suffered from anxiety and panic most of my life, but it has definitely gone into overdrive. I am constantly jittery, jumpy, overwhelmed, stressed, and all the other lovely symptoms! I honestly want to jump out of my skin most days.. -Dizzy/off balance/vertigo...Yep. Basically I have one of those 24/7. The best part is feeling like you are drunk, but didn't have the pleasure of drinking anything, lol! -Sinus/ear issues...I feel like my sinuses are constantly acting up and my ears feel plugged/clogged most of the time. So there's that, lol. -Rib pain/tightness..This is a fun one. It makes you feel like there is a tight banned wrapped around you and you can't breath. Makes for a fun time... -Head pressure/tightness/cotton head...No explanation needed. This one stinks. -Dryness...Everywhere...My hair, scalp, skin, eyes, lips, nose, vagina..you name it. There is not enough moisturizer, eyes drops, nose spray, chapstick and conditioner in the world for this.. -Numbness/tingling...I get it on my face, legs, arms, feet, lips. I have been having this for years. I do have fibromyalgia, but I feel this is hormone related since it seems to be worse during different cycles. -Pelvic heaviness/pain...This seems worse at the end of my period into ovulation. Every month is different, but I get it to some degree. It's almost like the feeling when you are later in your pregnancy and the head is resting on your pelvic area. Yeah. -Irregular periods..Right now they are anywhere from 19-31 days. Heavy, clotty and run from 4-8 days. I have had only one light period and that was a few months ago. I feel like I am always bleeding. I usually can get two periods in one month. Also fun.. -Depression.. No energy. Crying. Emotional. Want to pull the blanket over my head and hide. I did have a 5 month period last year where I cried all the time. I didn't want to leave my room. My anxiety was at it's highest then. It was horrible. I never thought I would make it through. It's not as bad as then, but it's still there. Definitely worse with hormone changes. -Vision changes...My eyesight has definitely changed. My vision can also get blurry and foggy at times. -Dissociation..I feel like I am out of my body and looking at everything through fog (This seems to be anxiety related). -Weird smells..I smell things that no one else does. Garbage, smoke, etc. -Housebound...Basically I am housebound right now. A lot of it is from the anxiety and head issues. I fear that one of my symptoms will be magnified when I am out, etc. When I do go out it's at night since I don't feel as overwhelmed. I avoid fluorescent lights and super large places. It's just too much. -Burning mouth/metallic taste...This one I get on and off. It's such a strange sensation! -Allergies/colds...I have always had allergies, but they have definitely ramped up! I feel like I always have a cold! -Flushed face/Hot and cold...I get a flushed face and ears, and the rest of my body gets hot then cold and back and forth. I dress in layers just to make it a bit easier. Being hot makes my anxiety worse, so I am figuring out ways to keep cool. My hands and especially my feet seem always cold, but I can't put anything too warm on my feet because I will get too warm, lol! Can't win! -Breast changes...They get more painful and tender. I also get the feeling of engorgement and let down and obviously I am not breastfeeding, lol. It happens more mid cycle, but I have had it last for longer periods at different times of the month. Heartburn/gerd/bloating...This one is just horrible all around. I always feel bloated and have heartburn no matter what I eat. It makes me feel so uncomfortable and I feel like the gas pushes on my diaphragm (I hope that made sense, lol!) This one I will not miss! I do have many more, but I have written a mini novel....lol! I just want you strong ladies to know that we are in this together! Reach out if you ever have any questions! I am lucky enough to have a very supportive husband and children, but I know there are quite a few on here who aren't. Just know I am here for you! We got this ladies, even though we are in the midst of hell right now! Sending all the strength, hugs, and prayers to you! ❤️"

I feel like I’m not getting oxygen to my brain or something sometimes it’s hard to speak. Also sometimes in the middle of the night my body will tremor like someone shaking me to wake up. i’ve been to 1 million doctors and I’ve had 1 million tests and I’m really about to give up. I’ve given it to the end of the year and that’s it I’m done with tests. I go to bed Thinking this is it I’m gonna not wake up. I breathe into a brown bag or sniff just to try to Jan so I can get some oxygen inside my brain. Also when I stand up my legs are either week or staff or sore it’s the strangest thing.

This has not been recommended by the any Dr likely because of my age (53) but one of my friends mentioned it. I'm not too concerned if I have irregular periods, I just want this continuous period to stop! Any advice would be appreciated, thank you."
jessica60993,2019-12-13T02:49+00:00,Low Estrogen,"hi everyone , so i had hormone testing done and my gyne called and told me my estrogen level is real low and thats why i have been experiencing so many symptoms for past 4 months. i am on full menopause (2 years of no period) but last 4 months i noticed a huge increase in anxiety, digestion problems, sinus problems, fatigue, feeling light headed, hot flashes, cold flashes, no appetite, weight loss, head fog, irritability, my hair is shedding. just feel like s*** sometimes. he is considering a low dose of estrogen/ progesterone but stated he going to really think about it because its a lot of controversy surrounding HRT. my vitamin D is low. i had a full thyroid panel, glucose done and its normal but i do feel like my body is imbalanced. He recommended exercise, meditation, nuts, coffee and lots of green veggies. Does anyone have these symptoms experiencing low estrogen? if so how or what are you doing to increase your levels? I really dont want to do HRT but will if its no other way to turn this around. Im trying not to freak out."

maddysmom2015,2019-12-11T17:47+00:00,Polyp panic,"Hello Ladies, I had a uterine polyp biopsied last month. It was benign. But we decided to take it out. I had the surgery yesterday and physically feel fine today. No bleeding, cramping or pain at all. Psychologically, I am now a mess. I had this procedure done about 7 years ago by another doctor at another hospital (in the US). He did a preliminary look at the tissue in the OR and told me it was fine. So waiting for the pathology report wasn't as stressful. This time the new doctor at the new hospital didn't check the tissue sample. So naturally, I melted down and started googling. 1% of the polyps are cancerous.....And I am clearly in the 1%.... It doesn't matter to me that 99% of them are fine. And that the tissue has already been biopsied and shown benign. So the health anxiety exploded. Did she really look, so something scary, and doesn't want to say until she's sure? Or is it just not her practice to pre-empt the pathologist? Why does this happen? Why can't I cope? I am physically feeling great. Help me ladies! I am going absolutely mad!"

I'm 50 so Dr thought this would help get me to meno. She said it helps many of her patients. Why didn't it help me? I guess it was worth a try--- she did say, if for some reason it doesn't help, she could go back in and shave down the fibroids - she didn't want to do this weeks ago due to low iron. I know many women have to deal with this-- but I'm so tired of this freakin period and taking iron.. I really believed I was FREE of this thing. Guess I need to continue eating red meat and spinach too."

hopeforever,2019-12-08T02:55+00:00,I had lipo. In pain but the best decision I made for myself,"Hello Ladies. Last Wednesday i had lipo done on my stomach, back, arms inner and outer thighs. The reason i did it was because since peri I gained 45lbs and everyday had been a struggle for me dealing with the symptoms but the worst part of it was the mental torment having to see myself in the mirror. Before peri I use to be fit and happy and confident in myself then suddenly one day BAM out of nowhere came hell. The weight came on gradually and then my clothes didn't fit, I felt disgusted and when i started a new exercise plan in went downhill because some days the energy was not there and the symptoms would be to much to work out. I had friends tell me not to do lipo but i went forward and did it. The procedure took 3 and a half hrs. Wednesday night was quite painful up until Friday night. Today i was able to move around some without too much discomfort. I must admit that wearing the compression garment is uncomfortable but with time i will get use to it. For best results i was told to wear it for 3 months. When i look in the mirror now even swollen i look much smaller. I have a way smaller stomach, waist and no more rubbing of my inner thighs which i hated the most. I would highly recommend anyone on this forum to do it. Mentally i feel so much more uplifted and so ready for 2020. I made a lot of drastic changes in my life over the past 5 months. I moved and also bought a new car. I realized that i had to make changes to see positive results in my life mentally and physically. Hoping , wishing and praying that next yr will be better than this yr. This yr had been complete hell a total right off. I will keep you all updated on my progress. I feel that i need some rest. All take care. God bless"

I am finally resting from the bothers of a c-section but now I've started to actually feel the effects of menopause and I am at complete loss. The hot flashes are horrible. I get them maybe 20 times a day and there's no way to calm them down. they are accompanied by sharp chest pain and fast breathing, and I cannot for the life of me find anything about that. It feels like I'm having an anxiety episode, twenty times a day. I wasn't really warned about this at all and I don't know what else I'm missing, or what's to come. I also suffer from a major depressive disorder, and I had been moderately good until now; I've had a really bad mood fall these last weeks. It's making it hard to cope. I've read that surgical menopause lasts until its normal age of decline, is that true? is there anything I can do to calm these symptoms? I'm barely managing and I have so little information, I'd love some experiences from other people. Thank you and please have a good day!"

It is ridiculous. The strange thing is that, prior to perimenopause, I almost never got angry, so this is very uncharacteristic for me. It is so difficult dealing with the extreme irritation and the impulse to just lash out over nothing. Even the birds chirping outside my office window can make me want to find a gun and shoot them all, when the anger flares up! This is one crazy ride!

SoccerMom,2019-12-05T01:31+00:00,Pain in lower right side,"Hi all, Since August I've had mild pain in my lower right side (to the right of my pelvic bone). It comes & goes and theres no rhyme or reason to it. I've had a vaginal ultrasound and a lower abdominal ct with & without contrast. Fortunately, nothing has been found other than a few small ovarian cysts that should not be causing any pain. My next step is a colonoscopy which I'm having in a couple of weeks. I've had a couple of doctors say it could be a pull or tear, but I'm just wanting to be thorough. Has anyone else been dealing with this? I'm 52 and have irregular periods, so I'm still in peri. Thanks in advance!"

I'm still off balance and still can't focus a little over a year now. I cannot take HRT. I feel robotic each day though and vulnerable due to this and it's really starting to depress me. Does this end? Is a little over a year not normal to still have this? I can't go back to work yet and I feel so bad for my family. They are very supportive but, they are somewhat on hold while I'm like this and it makes me feel very bad. I'm on vitamins and all the right supplements. I tried anxiety meds. They made it worse. I really have a hard time taking any type of medication. This just really hit me hard and for whatever reason I can't shake it yet. No one talks about this and it seems like the only woman that have it severe only exist online. Thanks!"

They are heavy and clotty (which I have always had, just seem to be worse), and last anywhere between 4 and 8 or so days. Lately they seem to last forever at the end and it's like a game of peekaboo. I wipe nothing, then later I am bleeding again. It also seems after number two it restarts it again. I feel like I am going nuts along with this and all the other awful symptoms.

NothinforNothin,2019-11-29T01:34+00:00,I read this tonight. It's just some info about - The Menopause Histamine Connection.,"Hello Ladies: I'm doing my research. Determined to beat this. I'm reading on line a connection regarding women suffering from histamine intolerance brought on by the hormonal fluctuations common during meno. Foods high in histamine can trigger allergy-like reactions in your body. High Histamine is hidden in the lists of things that can go haywire with our bodies during meno. I also, read Claritin blocks the action of histamine. It's a HI Blocker they call it and on line I read it can lower any inflammation that is going on to help lower your symptoms by blocking the high histamine levels if you have them. So, I'm on day 2 of the Claritin and my head is calming down from dizziness. I'm feeling more mindful also, of my actions which I haven't been able to grasp in months. So, something is breaking up. I can't wait to be on it for week or 2 to see if it really really works but, today has been my best day in 9 months and it's not due to today being a holiday at all. I think there is a real link with food though during this time. On line there is a lot of info about it. You can look up The Menopause Histamine Connection. Also, The Curious Link Between Estrogen, Mast Cells, and Histamine . It starts off stating that: Headaches. Anxiety. Insomnia. Brain fog. Hives, Nasal congestion. Are just a few symptoms of histamine intolerance or mast cell activation syndrome. I'm no doctor. I think there are other blockers out there too other than Claritin. Always, make sure you can take something new with whatever your already taking but, just wanted to throw this out there. I think for me at least there is a real link here to this helping my symptoms and possibly someone else's. Thinking of you all during this time. Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving!!!!<3"

Today has been the worst Thanksgiving I've ever had. A deep dark fear of speaking up to men that was instilled into me by my ex husband has found a way to surface once again even after leaving him and it has possibly ruined the wonderful relationship I have been in now for the last three years. My current boyfriend feels completely responsible for my inability to speak up and it has caused him to feel the worst pain and anguish a man could feel. He did nothing wrong since I failed to speak up and tell him my fear and honest feelings. I didnt even realize I was doing it as it was so the norm for me for 21+ years. I dont know how to make him see that he is not at fault. He is afraid to come home he thinks that the worst possible scenario is here. I now know that I have to go speak with a professional to deal with and overcome my fear and come to terms that all men aren't the same. Thank you for being here and listening and helping ladies. You are all amazing and helpful if than for nothing else but to listen.

christina1977,2019-11-23T08:01+00:00,Hormones going crazy,"I'll start with a little backstory. In 2009, I had a total hysterectomy at the age of 31. Enter the new world of surgical menopause. I wasnt on HRT. Fast forward to 2019. Somewhere in this year my hormone levels which were already so low or non existant went crazy and stopped completely. Over time, I became a person I didnt know. I no longer had any emotion about anything, I had zero sex drive, I was moody and every little thing set me off, I was so tired and sick all the time. I had no excitement about anything in life. Now mind you, I'm a pretty happy go lucky person. I try to enjoy life as much as possible and dont sweat the small stuff. So I changed which seemed like overnight to me, but was really over a period of time. My relationship suffered horribly. We weren't talking, i just sat there like a bump on a log, emotionless and cold. Didn't care if my significant other was there or not, didnt care if the furkids were there or not, didnt care if I was there or not. Almost a depression type state. I got to researching after numerous arguments with my boyfriend over how I've changed. I did some research and it seemed as though my thyroid was acting up or my hormones were way out of balance. So off to the doc I go and she tests the thyroid...a-ok to her surprise. So I start taking estrogen/testosterone. It's now two months into the hrt, I am feeling some better but not myself still. Has anyone else went through this and has hrt helped you or is there some other thing or things I can try to help as well. I really want to be myself again and not feel like a prisoner in my own body and like a crazy lady. I want to desire to have sexual relations with my man again. I want to be able to not feel weird. Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated."

jen78653,2019-11-21T22:21+00:00,Perimenopause is the gift that keeps giving....new symptoms.,"Hi, I have been on here regarding my BV that only stays under control with boric acid. My periods come every 24 days and last only two days. The two days I have my period are very heavy and I feel so irritated using pads. I switched to organic, non chlorine pads months ago (again BV related) and I take a few days of boric acid right after my period to keep my PH level good. This month, after my period I started with some on and off vaginal vulva throbbing. Does anyone experience this? Is this another hormone related symptom? It doesn't hurt to wear clothing or when I touch it. Only just hits me with a throb here and there randomly. I unfortunately due to my short periods go right into my ovulation week - so is that related? Any thoughts?"

Or if there's a supplement they won't be without. everyday- spirulina-- think it helps with my dark under eye circles and also with some anxiety/moods as well as other things. Multi-vitamin, coq10, fish oil, womens wellness--- so far no hot flashes and need help with anger with periods calcium with magnesium in same pill At nite iron for heavy periods extra Vit D-3 sometimes extra magnesium for sleep, aches, BP Just ordered a probiotic to see if that helps with anything--I hope I can tell a difference. I've read that it's important to take. I have skipped days with some of these or alternate because it's a lot of pills and lately I just don't feel like taking them for whatever reason.. I think at the moment I feel good taking the spirulina, Vit D and iron knowing that it's helping with something. I have a few others things in my cabinet but really not sure they are helping with anything so for now they are sitting."
Guest,2019-11-21T01:05+00:00,Itching. Atrophy?,"Hi ladies! I am actually only 22 so im not in menopause, but have some problems going on that lead me to believe my estrogen levels might be off, and I dont know where else to find people who can answer my questions.. This is a lot of TMI so i apologize in advance... I have been on depo provera birthcontrol for over 5 years. About a year ago I experienced my first ever issue with my vagina. I was afraid thinking that my partner cheated on me and gave me something. I was itchy and had a tear in my vaginal skin.. turned out to be nothing and was instructed to use lubricant during sex.. So I have been using this ever since but it is not uncommon for sex to be a little painful and to have spotting after.. I also have itching and irritation that comes and goes, no STDs as I have been tested 3 times this year.. I also have noticed that somedays I feel like I have to pee every hour, but sometimes its normal. it also seems like I have to try extra hard to empty my bladder fully... Another thing I have noticed is that im getting this white clumpy stuff coming out of my pores around the clitoral area. I thinks its normal secreations that are drying and then clumping up? I dont think I had this before but cant find anything about it online, ill attach a picture of what it looks like.... One time the itching got really bad so I went in to the doctor and it ended up being yeast and BV, i did the treatment and it helped a lot but not enough. still itchy. I have gone back twice since then and dont have either infection anymore.... I have made a lot of life style changes which do help quite a bit. I dont wear anything restricting, dont ride my bike anymore, cotton only underwear, toilet paper and laundry soap for sensitive skin, and I use yeast infection cream for a night when the itching gets bad which seems fend it off for about a week... the doctors are no help, they tell me everything looks normal, swab me and then send me on my way.. it takes 3 weeks to get back in but its exhausting to keep going... what do you guys think. To those who are experiencing atrophy, does it seem similar? Click here to view image"

On my nose I get pimples ( white heads), and both on my nose and my face I get also so called blind pimples: those that are under skin and never get ripe, and last forever, and the discoloration basically never goes away. I did not have acne or bad pimples literally NEVER, not in my teenage years, not later. What new hell is this? I also do not know how to prevent them, or make them last shorter. My dermatologist, who is very good, gave me high blood pressure medication, but I truly do not want to put yet another prescription medication into my body ( those are oral pills to reduce and control blood pressure). I did confirm on several respectable medical web sites that these are actually prescribed for hormonal acne, so, he knew what he was doing, but I am not taking them. Does anyone else has this problem, and of so, do you know how to fight it? I do use OTC spot medication for acne, but I do not believe this is enough. I hate this so much, really."

Last Friday, when my boyfriend was here, I was screaming, not at him, but just screaming, because I had so much anguish inside of me, that I didn't know what to do. I spent the rest of the night crying on and off because the emotional pain just felt unbearable. When I woke-up the next day, I felt perfectly normal, and we had a great weekend together. It was bliss! Now, I am back to feeling agitated, so much so, that it is hard to bear. I am 51, and I am getting over 100 days between periods, so I know that I am getting there, but it is just so hard to believe that it can be this brutal and this unpredictable.

I'm 51 and def going thru menopause. recently I've been experiencing a strange discomfort when I eat or drink that I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced. when I eat or drink anything it feels like it's sitting at the upper left side of my left breast. It's not a terrible pain. just a sensation if you will. I can also feel on my back in the same spot. It's usually followed by burping. but I've never experienced this before and like many of you on here WEBMD is NOT your friend and scares me every time I check strange symptoms. I feel fine otherwise. can anyone relate? ps...i don't take any meds and labs were all fine at Dr appt 3 months ago. thank you in advance.

The Jitters, Anxiety, Heart Palpitations, Panic Attacks, Blurred Vision, Dizziness, Off Balance Feeling, Pressure in My Head, Etc are ruining my life. I don't know what to do anymore.

Went to Target with my Mom the other day and got stuck at the end of an isle holding on to a shelf for dear life crying. I felt so off balance, had a panic attack and couldn't move for a minute. This can't be my life forever. It's horrible. I want to go on hikes like I use to, go to the beach and boogie board again..

I have seen a consultant today and subject to results of a biopsy which she did today, provided all comes back okay, have been recommended for a radio-frequency endometrial ablation - a scan on 4th October showed the endometrial thickness to be 24mm. She did say that it might not be possible to carry out the ablation and if this was the case a mirena coil would be the option (I am having a general anesthetic so assume this would be done at the same time if the ablation was not done). The waiting time for an initial appointment on the NHS was 10 weeks so I am self funding at a private clinic. If all okay to go ahead with the ablation this should take place sometime this month. Am wondering has anyone else had this treatment and was it successful? I am told that 50% of the time it stops bleeding completely, 40% improves it and 10% no improvement, this is the same as with the mirena apparently?"

I had a terrible perimenopause. It gets worse the older I am. When my periods stopped for the last time (though at that time I didn't know it.) Hell like I have never known has unleashed on me. Pain is the name of the game and I am it's unwilling player. I thought it was supposed to get better after menopause? I used to go into the doctor at any signs of weirdness. But now because there has been no help for me (and my doctor quit her practice)I don't see the point. I just am slowly very painfully dying. Middle right side terrible back pain, moves to the side and then front. My rotten husband Googles symptom which I hate because I refuse to. So I can't get away from it. Kidneys, cancer, etc. Now I am worried it is my kidney. I have leg pain. Left ovary area pain, that goes away then comes back sharp and then just aches. . My Gyno says even though I have cyst on my ovaries they wouldn't cause me pain. She says you have something else to worry about and to get a colonoscopy. Is that her way of calling me a lying hypochondriac? I would gladly give her or my husband my pain. Now I have stomach pain because of the ibuprofen and stress from back pain. Pain moves through my body like blood moves through the body. Then to top it off I am pretty sure I have either a BV (no odor) or a yeast infection. Great. I have my annual pap tomorrow afternoon. Bought a new bed about two months ago and I HATE it. To soft. the bed I we had for several years was really hard. I realize there is no hope for me. This is it. I am doomed. It just keeps getting worse. I have lost 20lbs. Difficult for me to lose weight but my thyroid is fine. (Still need to lose another 40lbs) I feel worse instead of better. How is that possible?? I am afraid to eat because of reaction to food. No sugar, no caffeine, no dairy and now low fat and low carb. I drink only water. I don't have children and I don't live anywhere around friends or family other than my dog and husband. I don't work outside the home. I have been on bp meds and cholesterol meds for years. A true sad sack huh? lol. I am sorry for being so negative. Pain and stress has consumed my personality. It has eaten it whole and now I can only function on a very basic level. Thank you, and Bless every single one of you."

I called in work today to take tomorrow off because the thought of waking up early and driving 45 min to and fro makes me sick to my stomach. I do not know how much of that i can take anymore. Thank God i have a good saving and retirement , i think i am going to quit work and live off what i have until things get better. I have no choice at this point. This has been one hell of a yr, i did not live i just existed."

sakura26,2019-11-12T01:07+00:00,Anyone Have Dermoid Removed From Ovary?,"Hi, trying this forum as got no replies in cyst forum ... I have a 5cm dermoid cyst on my ovary and I'm 47. I've had one doc say that I could leave it and watch it but that it may continue to grow indefinitely and still eventually need to come out. Another doc said sometimes they get smaller after menopause. Then I've had several others say I should get it out now before it gets bigger because it could also take over more of the ovary and be harder to remove or cause other issues like torsion or turn into something bad tho it looks benign now and honestly doesn't physically bother me that I can tell. I have more symptoms from peri and my giant fibroid. QUESTION: I'm confused about the surgery, if anyone's had it. I had one surgeon say she could leave behind part of the dermoid to save my ovary. Another said no, he'd need to peel away the whole dermoid so some of my ovary cells would come with it (like peeling an orange out of its skin) but that the bulk of my ovary would stay behind and recover, but that I would have more hormonal issues at first post surgery (I'm already in peri). For you ladies who have had dermoid surgery and kept your ovaries, which was the case? Did they take the whole cyst and peel back/shave off a small portion of your ovary? Or did they just take part of the cyst and leave your entire ovary, no peeling? And did your ovary recover in either case? Thanks!!!"
Marinab,2019-11-06T01:19+00:00,Bleeding After D&C,I had a D&C about 5 days ago and am still bleeding. The last D&C I had pre-menopause in my mid-40s resolved a bleeding issue and I felt great. Now I'm 53 and find it has been much more difficult; took longer to recover from the anesthesia and passing small clots. Has anyone had a D&C and does this sound normal? I have a follow-up with my doctor tomorrow and am really anxious about the pathology results which are already in but it sounds like my doctor wants to share the results in person...yikes! I had a pelvic ultrasound and a biopsy and the results were normal. Reason for D&C was spotting due to polyps. My period was due before the D&C and I feel like I may have it now but I don't even think this is possible due to the removal of the lining.Can you still get your period right after a D&C? Thanks!

I weight 116lbs pretty active dont eat the best but im not over weight.

Now the doc there wasnt concerned but I am and its giving me anxiety. I still get a period but its very heavy and I am actually due tomorrow. I have scheduled a doc appt for next week but was wondering if anyone elses bp has increased during this time? What was the out come? Did they ask you to monitor it for awhile before deciding? I really dont want to take meds and would like to lower it naturally but will leave that up to my doc. Just needing reassurance when you google it makes you even more nervous.

It's quite itchy. But I am starting to wonder if it's menopause-related. It coincided with start of cold weather, so having heat on, dryness and wearing wool. It is also coincident with a return of ovulation fluid (even though my last period was over a year ago), so there's some kind of hormonal fluctuation happening. Have never had a rash like this before except once from a sunscreen, but I haven't used any new products lately. It does seem to worsen with heat. Anyone have this problem?"

mel65197,2019-11-04T16:12+00:00,Bad episode(s) - Perimenopause,"Hi gals - I had a bad episode (after feeling pretty good for a few weeks) on Sat. morning. It was familiar - heart racing, feeling of lightheadedness, head pressure, panic, a need to crawl out of my skin, etc. It went on for a good hour. I took .25 mg of Xanax which usually calms it down but leaves me feeling a little groggy. Anyway, I recovered ok, felt mostly fine the rest of the day and Sunday. Then I was going to bed last night after reading for a bit and started feeling WEIRD. Like I couldn't really think straight, and my heart started pounding and I felt really off/spacey like I was going to faint (while lying in bed!). I got up and took my pulse - it was 125. I also felt dizzy and nauseous. I took .25 mg again of Xanax (which I only do when it is really bad) and after about an hour or so felt like I could lie down and try to sleep. This morning I feel weak, tired and headachey. Heart rate is still up but not like it was last night. I just finished a strange period cycle - heavy bleeding for three days, gone for 3, then back with spotting for another 3. Does anyone else feel like their symptoms flair around your cycles? Mine are unpredictable and erratic. Also, I'm just venting here and feeling frustrated because I felt pretty good for a time, then wham - got hit with all the crap again. 😦"

Tamara1005,2019-10-25T17:02+00:00,Are there signs/symptoms when actual menopause is about to begin?,"Hi everyone, I am so glad I found this board! Since this is my first post, let me introduce myself by saying I am 45 years old and have been experiencing perimenopause for a good three years or so; the last two being very intense with various symptoms. I know that obviously, you'll know you're going through (gone through?) menopause when you don't have a period for a full 12 months. But, do you have any symptoms when menopause is actually about to start? Do periods just abruptly stop or is there more to it? I've been feeling more ""off"" the past couple weeks. Like I can ""sense"" something ""different"" is happening to my body; I don't know how else to word it. I'm late to having my period, even though I have all the usual PMS symptoms. (No, I am not pregnant) The past couple weeks I've been dealing with terrible headaches and occasional dizziness. My pap smears have always been normal, so I am not concerned about that. I am just wondering, could this be it? Could menopause be starting? I know my mother started perimenopause around the same time I did and went through menopause before she turned 50. By the time she was 50, it was five years since she had a period (she's 59 now). I sure hope all of this made sense lol. Can anyone shed light on when you know menopause is about to begin?

First day was heavy, 2nd day was a bit better. I was flowing heavy and then it just stopped like a faucet was turned off. Nothing for at least eighteen hours. Then boom it started heavy flow again.

My health anxiety is even worse. My dog is sick too so I have health anxiety about her. My patient and kind husband keeps telling me that my dog and me are ok.

I think I need to decide if I should do HRT again, but frankly I find the start up effects pretty horrendous and have never really got any relief - I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. I am in the UK btw, so we don't have compounded HRT's here, but do have body identical. I am thinking of just going with 1mg estradiol tablets, but am scared to start. I have tried patches and gel previously, but just don't absorb them. The symptoms I am dealing with are (in order of what's bothering me the most): Crippling anxiety - every day. Suicidal thoughts, and severe crying spells. Feelings like I am going mad. Hideous hot flushes, with adrenaline surges that feel like full on panic attacks. Total lack of energy. Severe vertigo. Weight gain of nearly 3 stone since surgery - my thyroid is OK, no diabetes and I eat a very healthy diet and only 1200 calories per day. Dry, itchy eyes. Dry skin and hair. Headaches and migraine with aura. Tight, stiff muscles. I would have thought - as my hormones are no longer cycling - that I should have settled at a low level and not be getting some of this by now. Does this mean that 'this is it' now then? Is this how it's going to be forever? Because if so, I really can't bear to live like this..... Oh - and I actually hate my surgeon for not telling me how bad this was going to be. He said surgical menopause 'at my age' (I was 46 at the time of surgery) really wouldn't be any problem. Like a fool, I believed him......😥"
Chickadeesgrl,2019-10-30T16:58+00:00,Pain all over...every day,"Hello ladies, I am seeking advice and wisdom! I lie in bed every night and pain radiates through my body...mainly my arms, neck, shoulders and legs. I toss and turn through the night. When i wake up int the morning, my joints hurt and it is difficult to walk. once I am up, my muscles loosen up but the pain never goes away. I do yoga and low impact aerobics every morning. I have started massage therapy & it really hurts! I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia but honestly i think it is more hormone related. Blood work all normal. Haven't had hormone testing. Does anyone else have this pain? Also my armpits are on fire and painful and sometimes it feels like they swell up. On Sunday, i felt like a cold sore/pimple was forming in my armpit. Sure enough a small pea bump formed and hurt like heck (freak out when I google). It has almost disappeared but I have been to the doctor twice about the swelling, pain and bumps. She says its lymph node related but it freaks me out! I recently had a mammogram. Sorry for the rant, just looking for women who are going through the same issues."

I am 49 yrs old, my last period was august 2017. 6 days ago I began spotting, it would randomly change from brown to red with moderate cramping. the 4th day there was no spotting but rather a gush of brownish liquid. day 5 and day 6 moderate cramping no spotting. i went to the gyn today (day 6) and he said my cervix visually appeared good. he said my uterus felt normal but that any bleeding after menopause is abnormal but maybe i had a surge of hormones and i had a period? i asked how that was possible when my right ovary isnt even visible on utz anymore. so he said i need a biopsy and their 1st appt is 2 full months away..12/31/19. i have crappy insurance and no blood work was done. my lower back aches and my right loin area aches and when i asked when this pain will go away..he said ""soon"". im so confused"
VAV2018,2019-10-30T23:00+00:00,Crazy food reaction! Sudden nut allergy??,"Hi ladies. I just had a scary and strange experience. I was munching on pecans when I suddenly became horribly nauseated. I was barely able to put my eight month old down before I had to run to the bathroom to throw up! I have never had nut allergies so I don't know what that was! We recently moved from Texas to Washington state and I have been having trouble with my allergies (hayfever) since we've been here. But again, I've never had nut allergies. Can you get food allergies in your 40's? Can peri affect allergies?? Has anyone else experienced this? And I feel cold now...my feet especially. Is this a peri thing??"
maddysmom2015,2019-10-28T17:59+00:00,"Does ""normal"" uterine thickness vary during the month?","I went to the GYN today for an ultrasound and uterine biopsy. The Dr. found a polyp. I've had a polyp before; so while I'm not thrilled, I'm not terrified. There's a less than 1% chance the polyp will be a problem. I'm trying to treat it like the tonsils of the uterus. He asked the tech what the thickness of the uterus was. And she said ""9 cm."" So he said, ""let's do a biopsy."" That's what scared me. The ultrasound showed I had normal ovarian cysts indicating I am ovulating or had just ovulated. (I'm 52!) But I haven't had a period in 40 days. My question is, does the uterine thickness vary/increase the closer we get to menstruation? Would 9mm be a concern right after a period, but right before a period be about average? Dr. Google seems to indicate that can be the case. I also read that a polyp can make the uterine lining read thicker than it is on the ultrasound. The biopsy results will be back in 5 days. And I was just looking for some insight from you ladies as a way to de-escalate as I wait it out. Love to all of you!"

My usual routine, get up, shower, dress, put on deodorant and makeup and good to go. Now I have to put on an extra layer of deodorant before leaving the house, then in the car, stopped at a light I will add a spray of another type of deodorant and then I keep that on hand and will add another spray at some point or two during my day, then when I change into my pajamas I will add another layer of stick deodorant. Even with all this I will still smell like b.o. on occasion. The hot flashes and night sweats throughout the day obviously contribute to my problem, but I wonder if others have a similar issue and if they've found a solution."
sakura26,2019-10-31T06:31+00:00,Anyone else find peri/menopause worsen PTSD and dissociation?,"Hi, I've had complex PTSD since I was 9 and dissociation on and off. Since I hit peri it seems like the dissociation is getting to a scary level and PTSD in general has worsened. Traditional anxiety meds have never helped much with either so wondering if any of you women are in the same boat and have found anything to help, especially preventing dissociation? My dissociation isn't linked to one clear memory of anything, hence complex PTSD. Has taking more hormones like progesterone etc helped balance things out? Can anyone in CA suggest a doc? I'm desparate for help. I have to be careful with hormones because of a fibroid but want my life and brain back. It's one of the many things going to shizit during peri but the most concerning.

I know I'm getting better and making progress. I do try to stay positive but, it's hard. You think your strong until this hits. I know I will be stronger once through this but, I'm scared how much longer I'm going to be here waiting for this to break and if I will be hit with a second round after peri ends and I actually enter into menopause.

Keljo48,2019-10-23T13:01+00:00,Itching,"I have developed this irritation /itching in spots in the crease of my legs. It is maddening. It started the last part of this year and it is hard to function. When I look with a mirror I don't see anything unusual but there is a thinner area what I believe is a stretch mark. (Lovely) I have tried baby powder (starch- not talc) and hydrocortisone cream and that makes it worse. I think underwear is irritating it. It is hard to function on a remote normal level. That added with my usual aches and pains- I just hate being this me and I cry everyday because of it. I am two years post menopause and it seems like I have now have pinpoint issues. Breast pain, itching, calf pain, armpit pain, ovary pain and skipping heart beats. I got rid of the breast pain, and skipping heart beats, for the most part. Touch wood. I have had the others checked out besides the new (in the last couple months) intermittent inner crease of the leg itching/irritation. It comes and goes. Right now it is driving me absolutely batty and there is no relief. I am panty-less most of the day and sleep sans anything lower at night now. It is like my new thing and to be honest I would rather have the breast pain. I am fat, I will tell you that. I am about 45lbs over weight and I disgust myself. It's been a struggle to lose weight. I have lost 17 lbs, pound by pound but I have a long way to go. I put on so much weight during peri. I feel I sneeze and I gain a pound. So I know my fat thighs aren't helping my cause. I need something to make me feel normal. Even if it is just for a little while. I need a break from this person and her issues I have become. My personality, marriage, and everyday existence has declined since I started this journey from hell called menopause. It isn't getting easier for me but worse and that is utterly depressing and not a day goes by that I don't just put my face in my hands and sob. The cleaner I live: I don't drink, smoke, no caffeine, no sugar, eating greens and lean meat, the worse I feel. Not to mention I just don't have anything enjoyable and it is making me bitter and grouchy. No friends or family remotely nearby, no job. My over 26 year marriage is mostly hostility (me) My husband just doesn't understand or frankly care. I am petty enough when he has an ache or pain, I laugh (to myself). He has no idea. (Yeah I have become a horrible person). I take my dog out walking and for retail therapy to try and try and distract myself. This itchy/irritated thing I got going on- my life has now become unbearable. I also realize I annoyingly can't even write a short post. lol. GAH Thank you, every single one you on here. I feel I wouldn't be here without you all over the years I that have been on here."

Nothing much has changed over the years - flushes, horrible anxiety (my worst symptom), severe lack of energy and I've gained over 2 stone. I really think I'm going to have to start HRT in earnest, as this is not getting better - I think this is it now for life. 😥 Due to the HRT shortages and not getting on well on either patches or gel previously, I think my only option now is to try the Premarin tablets I have sitting here as they at least are consistently in stock (PLEASE - no posts about the ethics of Premarin, I know where it comes from and how it's produced). Is there anyone else out there who is in the same position as me? I would love to hear from other surgically menopausal ladies - especially if you are feeling better and have stories of hope!"

I am 47 , 3 adult kids and on the brink of divorce, i feel and have been going through peri for the past 4 yrs with no meds, just vitamins. There are some days which are more tolerable than others. I have experienced everything from ringing in ears, headaches, head pressure, vision problems, throat problems, gerd, chest heaviness, upper lower back pain, crazy thoughts, depression, sinus, heavy periods, missed periods, itchy skin, anxiety, panic attacks, feeling cold, feeling hot, insomnia, hips aches, numbness on face and hands, memory loss, fear of going outdoors far from home alone, dizzy, nausea, ribs crushing feeling,racing heart, etc. But for the past 2 days i have been experiencing such heaviness in my legs, pain in calf and a really stiff lower back. It seems so unbearable to the point were it makes me hard to walk. I am having to take breaks. I've cried my morning tears and i am sure i will cry right after writing this. No one i know, none of my friends are going through like me, not even my sisters. I ask myself what have i done wrong. The very thought of going through this for another 10 yrs cripples me. I am looking into HRT as my only resort to some form of happiness. I am scared but i must give it a try. This past July i went to Italy for a month with friends and the plane ride there and back had me in complete shambles. It didn't feel like a holiday because each day was something. Some days i went out and some days i stayed in. I felt like a heavy weight around them trying to put on a smile. To be honest it was a complete waste of money. I found this website late last night, thank God and have been hooked on reading every post. It has been very helpful knowing that i am not the only one going through. I wish i had found it earlier. There was a lady age 50 at my work who committed suicide last month who was struggling with depression . Toward the end of her life she missed plenty of work days, called in sick. I now wonder if it was tied to peri or meno. Just like Kate Spade and many more that committed suicide. Why is this not being taken serious. Why isn't this being talked about ? I could rant all day on this topic because clearly i have nothing else to do but lay here on the couch with a heating pads with my leg raised under pillows. Thank you for taking the time reading this. God bless"

I have gained weight in my stomach and it is killing me because I was always used to being thin. I look horrible in my clothes, and it seems that I just stay hungry all of the time like some kind of ravenous wolf. Oh my! I don't even feel like a woman anymore, just a big blob of craziness. Out of the 66 symptoms of menopause, I have literally had everyone, right down to the itchy nipples. I have complained so much on here that I get tired of hearing myself complaining. I try my best to act like nothing is wrong, but on the inside I feel like I am falling apart. My home life is good. I have a wonderful and understanding husband, great kids, and an awesome Church family. I am blessed beyond measure. I may not have everything I want, but I do have everything I need, so why do I feel so bad when there are people out there who are in so much worse shape than I am? Any suggestions about how to get myself back on track and how to lose some weight would be greatly appreciated. I can't take hrt because of my fibroids. Hugs and love to all of you ladies who feel like they are falling apart too. It has to get better eventually. Kudos to all the ladies out there who breezed through menopause because I would not wish this mess on anyone."

I have been on here many times, posting and reading posts, and you ladies always help. My brain functioning is at an all-time low.

Waiting for this to end.,"Anyone else going through Perimenopause unable to work or function normally due to trouble concentrating and focusing? I'm dealing with this since last March. I'm getting better each day but, not to the point where I feel like I can function. Still struggling with some anxiety and now like depression because this is taking so long to pass. Anyone been in this position longer? I know everyone is different but, on line I heard this could run 6 months, a year, a year and a half. I can't take HRT or antidepressants. I'm feeling guilty because I can't fix this. I have a very supportive family but, I feel really bad right now because I'm stuck in this. I'm doing everything I should be. Eating right, exercising, resting. I still can't think straight. I've started a vitamin regimen. I'm just on it for 7 days. I really have to wait another week or so for them to kick in but, this is horrible. Worst time in my life. I've always taken care of myself and have been really strong. Feel broken. You would think by now in 2019 they would have something by now that could sort all this out for us women! Does it get a little better once you actually hit menopause. I read peri was usually worse? Guess that's different for everyone though. I can't wait until this ends. I will never be so happy to leave the house! ❤️ Hugs to all."

Rainbow976,2019-10-17T16:35+00:00,Follicle Stimulating Hormone/ Ovulation/Hair Shedding,"I have a lot of terrible symptoms and am only 42. One of the more heartbreaking is excessive hair shedding, dry brittle hair and thinning. Also my worsening facial hair and generally looking more like a man some days lol. For those that have any of these issues, do you notice an increase in shedding or facial hair growth near the time of ovulation/when you should ovulate or before menstruation? I definitely see a pattern and asked my doctor if FSH could be really surging to try to ovulate and if it could affect hair follicles. Of course she looked at me like I was crazy, but if it is stimulating the ovaries why couldn't it be affecting other follicles? I don't know but my cycles are 22 days now for nearly 3 years and I am tired of shedding massive amounts of hair and growing a beard every few weeks. The only time I feel normal is a few days into my period..if you can call it that. I hardly bleed for 2 days and then it's several days of spotting. Doctors claim my testosterone is low but make no comment on estrogen or progesterone levels. How can I have no sex drive, losing my hair and getting facial hair at the same with low t? I think T, E and possibly P are low but they won't recommend HRT due to my age and still cycling. Sorry for the rant, I am at the point where I feel I must have something like the big c because every system in my body is acting haywire yet all labs are ""normal ""."

Guest,2019-10-17T09:50+00:00,So is it the menopause or depression brought on by it?,"So i was wondering if a lot of my symptoms are actually from menopause or from the mental changes and anguish the hormone scramble brings on. I mean i know the very far apart periods , headaches and hot flashes are from the menopause, but what about the nausea, gut issues, insomnia, anxiety, afraid to leave my house and do anything...could that part be from depression brought on by the hormone changes? What worries me is no healthy diet, vitamins, exercise or even counseling (tried them all) will make it any better...so what else can we do if this is the case? Some women can take hormones and antidepressants with no problems, but i cant! I have horrible side effects to them both so what am i supposed to do? Not to mention regardless what anyone says it really isnt safe to stay on either one of those for life cause they each carry a risk of causing something that will make us sicker so eventually you would have to stop taking them and go through that whole adjustment period of your body thinking it needs them to survive....oh my goodness what lovely lives we live! Im so jealous of the women who just sail through this nightmare! So i felt like i had to rant...any thoughts from anyone?"

NothinforNothin,2019-10-16T01:51+00:00,Perimenopause: What no one discusses. Hot Flash....ha that's funny.,"So, I'm new to this forum and thankful to have found it. I recently collapsed 7 months ago from what I thought was stress. I flew into severe anxiety and panic. Then flew to my primary doctor who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety. I had never heard of perimenopause before. Menopause yes, and my mom had it really bad but, never thought about the time leading up to Menopause. My mom also, passed away from cancer when I was in my early 20's. I'm 48 now so, we didn't discuss it much. I just knew when she hit Menopause it was rough. I've never been stricken by anxiety and panic before so, I was sick for several months before I was well enough to realize that this may be hormone related. Right before I collapsed I was severely fatigued but, like many just thought it was stress related. I thought. I need more sleep. Then I remembered I had started having anxiety at night and heart palpitations long before this occurred but, I just continued with life at that time and thought again, I was stressed. I went to my Gyn who took blood work but, told me I couldn't be in peri. He asked if I was having hot flashes. Now not everyone gets hot flashes and many like me get the most severe symptoms. Never let anyone tell you something can not be happening to you because indeed I'm in peri. I probably would not have suffered as severely at that time had I not listened to my Gyn at that time. Always trust yourself. When first hit with the depression and anxiety. I also, had extreme trouble concentrating and focusing. I literally couldn't think. Brain fog to the max. I'm a details gal so, this drove me bonkers! My primary prescribed me Sertraline. It was not good for me. Wound up in the ER with bruising all over my legs. Tried Zoloft. Lost 20lbs felt awful and always numb. I know they work for some but, not at all for me. Right now I'm trying GNC's Women's Ultra Mega Menopause Vitapak Program for 30 days. Read good reviews on it. I also, take B6, D3, Magnesium, Theanine, Vitamin C and drink ton's of green tea. I'm hoping in the next coming weeks I feel better. These Vitapak's take one to two weeks to kick in. I do feel somewhat calmer having started taking them for the past 3 days. I feel anyone's pain going through this with severe symptoms. This has been pure hell and very scary. It exhausts you and I have felt like it's been ground hog day for the past several months. You get up. You don't get much accomplished. You go to bed and pray one day you wake up feeling normal. I pray for that day. I might look into a Naturopathic doctor next. I do keep reminding myself this shall pass. I did force myself to put up Halloween decorations tonight and for a brief moment I did feel better. Feeling dizzy and all I got them up!"

About a week ago I began getting really crampy, then the nauseousness started. Mostly when my stomach is empty. Then the last couple days I have been very emotional. I cry at stupid things on FB which is so not like me! Is it even possible for me to possibly be pregnant???? The last time I felt like this I was pregnant.

The burning varies, sometimes intense & sometimes mild & then i get like an adrenaline surge & feel sick to my stomach, but dont throw up - it generally passes after 1 to 2 hours but leaves me completely drained - i have had hot flashes & the sweats, but this is different - is it a different kind of anxiety attack or a different kind of hot flash? - i am just beside myself - drs cant seem to tell me what it is perhaps you ladies have experienced it & know what it is - i really want it to stop - the first time it happened, i went to ER & no one could tell me what was causing it - i am just fed up!!! 7 years post meno"

Yes, I am 44 and my periods are ridiculous and I have vision issues and migraines, but I also have a lot of anxiety. It all started with that darn migraine aura that scared the daylights out of me. I've had symptoms ever since, but is it just anxiety? Nearly ever post on here mentions anxiety. Is there anyone else out there that thinks maybe a few of us here are just suffering from anxiety/panic, but convincing ourselves that it is perimenopause? I know that I can attribute many of my symptoms to perimenopause, but maybe the suffering part is the anxiety. I'm confused."

GBNYC1,2019-10-04T11:24+00:00,Possible Peri - Bleeding for 23 days,"Hi I just turned 50 this year, in 1998 I had a fibroid removed the size of a basketball. Since then my periods have been terrific. On time every month, lasting 4-5 days In April I started to get some clots, nothing major. Then in May I was good, on time. Then in June I was 12 days late, and July also 12 days late. August there was a small indicator of ovulation, usually it is for a few days, but this time there was hardly anything. Now in September I was 15 days late and this came around 25 days after ovulation, which is usually bang on 13. At first this last period was light, then the clots started, then it stopped and then came back again. I am now with bleeding for 23 days. A light day pad is enough per day, but when the clots come, it bleeds a lot for an hour ( 1"" diameter clots and red red blood ) These clots are amateur hour compared to the monsters I was getting in 1998, then it gets lighter and less blood, only to feel it is over and then it repeats again without fail. Feeling like there is no end in sight My concern is, that this period is lasting so long. Sometimes it feels like it is ending and then BANG another clot and more bleeding. I am in the USA and have no insurance. So tests and all that are out at the moment. I am wondering if this could be perimenopause, considering my age. This month I have experienced some burning on my skin and breasts. Migraines, Dizziness and all the perimenopause stuff. So I am wondering if this bleeding is normal during perimenopause. I am also thinking a fibroid has come back. Or that I did not really ovulate last month if this is hormonal. If anyone else experienced this please chime in. How long will this last ? I just want full blown menopause to come. I never had a kid and wish I would have had the whole thing removed in 1998, I am so regretful now. I have zero pain, zero fatigue , nothing. If not for this bleeding I would be 100% myself. I started taking the iron supplements, as I remember in 1998 the Dr told me to take them, so just in case, I have started them. So if anyone can share you experience , that would be great because no matter what you search for on the internet, it is immediately cancer. Hang Nail = Cancer, it is ridiculous Thanks G in NYC"

It doesn't help that I already had PTSD before peri kicked it up more. I've been on the mini pill for a few years tho it seems useless. The dizzy spells started happening around my period but this week it kicked up and I haven't gotten a period which also makes me worry I'm closer to menopause. Tho I am continuously taking the mini pill (but it usually doesn't stop my period). Guessing my hormones are nose-diving again. It's baffling to me doctors can't just give you more of whatever hormone and balance me out but they tell me they can't, it's too tricky. Wondering 2 things. #1 Based on your experience, do these dizzy spells usually mean you're months away from menopause or have any of you had peri dizzy spells for years? #2 What can I do? Have any of you found a way to make the dizzy spells stop or become less frequent or a way to feel better during a dizzy spell? Other than stay away from caffeine and lie motionless in bed? (I regret drinking a few glasses of iced tea at lunch tho other weeks I've done the same with no issue.) Thanks ladies!!!"

Most women (70%) will be yin, but there are also two types of yin and two types of yang. My reading says that if you are Yin these are foods and supplements that can help reduce hot flashes: Vitamin E - supplement with lowest recommended dosage, foods: wheat germ oil, canola oil, sunflower oil - nourishes yin and anchors yang heat Flaxseed - supplement with lowest recommended dosage, original form - nourishes and supports the function of the liver, lungs, and large intestines Soybeans - not compatible Magnesium - tolerable in food but not recommended as a supplement, eat dark leafty greens, pumpkin seeds, cashews, almonds, seafood, beans, whole greens, avocados, yogurt, bananas - promotes the downward flow of energy, roots the mind and spirit Sage - very compatible, original form or as a supplement - promotes harmonious flow of yang heat throughout the body Wild (Chinese) Yam - very compatible, original form (can be found in Asian food markets or as a supplement) - supports and nurtures yang energy, and to a lesser degree yin energy If you are Yang body type: Vitamin E - very compatible (see above) Flaxseed - supplement with the lowest recommended dosage (see above) Soybeans - very compatible, original form or in tofu, tempeh, soy-based yogurt - nourishes yin and has cooling energy Magnesium - supplement with the lowest recommended dosage (see above) Sage - not compatible Wild (Chinese) Yam - tolerable but not recommended (see above)"

I thought everything was better, until yesterday when I had a massage and once she worked that area I could feel the pain return while she was working it, I just assumed the muscle was tight so I let her do her thing....then as night came there was the on and off throb pain and I notice today there is a slight bruise barely noticeable more of a shadow in the same spot as before.

OR ... have any of you had these sorts of symptoms for years before full menopause? My OBGYN who I don't really trust did some blood tests 6 months ago and said I prob wouldn't go through final menopause until after 53. But then if I'm having all these symptoms now it's seem like it's much closer. I still haven't skipped a period yet ... I feel horrible, weak and shaky. I thought at first it might be a vitamin I was taking but I took the vitamin for two weeks and was fine until now and it doesn't make sense that if I took a vitamin at 11am I'd feel sicker at 6pm. This feels more hormonal 😦 I'm looking into fibroid surgery so I can potentially take HRT or hormones in the future since right now I'm afraid to take anything that would make the fibroid grow. But then honestly it seems like CA docs have no clue how to balance a woman's hormones anyway. And female docs actually seem more callous and uncaring. I guess none of them had menopause issues??? 😦 Am I normal? At least for the unlucky ladies that don't breeze through menopause like my mom or friends or the lousy OBGYNs I've seen? Thanks!"

I've been reading on here for the past 3 hours and discovered that even though we've been told post menopausal bleeding is ""abnormal"" it's actually not as ""abnormal"" as suggested... yes it needs looked into but if you talk to women and read about them it's actually quite common... and oddly reassuring... part of me feels bad that y'all are going through it but part of me is glad I'm not the only one... misery loves company I guess... sorry... anyhow I really am curious as to who all has had this post menopausal bleeding and what the process is after seeing a dr... do they immediately discuss the big C... it actually might depend on the dr too I guess...

Week later was just as bad so did another urine sample, this time dipped and told i've a UTI so 3 days antibiotics given. In the mean time results of sample came back from the lab as inconclusive for UTI.... but as the burning/peeing was still as bad Dr has given me another 7 days of antibiotics.... which normally sort it out quickly...but i'm still buring/peeing all the time, including 3/4 times during the night and quite frankly it's driving me insane... at one point it felt like an air bubble was tapped in there..🤔 I've also had and still do discomfort in the lower tummy.... I've suffered with vaginal dryness for years, have been on Vagifem for 2 years. Stopped this week as Dr said to try estirol cream instead , which is another story of how you get it to stay up there.... Use multi-gyn Actigel on the vaginal lips, also YES water based gel...

Lkl2019,2019-09-09T19:45+00:00,"POTS, Small Fiber Neuropathy, Fibromyalgia?","Through my struggles with Drs and tests, one neurologist did skin biopsy and I did test positive for small fiber neuropathy. however after additional testing, there still is no known cause. When I go into the support groups I find that alot of the people diagnosed with it suffer more with pain than they do all these other weird symptoms I do. I was always healthy until my late 30s and having typical hormone change symptoms. They say that many with SFN also have POTS which can cause many of the symptoms I see on the meno boards. And often it's women who suffer from POTS that are young teens, pregnant women and peri women. Some do improve after these hormonal transitions. I'm trying to learn and get as much support as possible from Drs etc but with limited energy, it's challenging and overwhelming. I.m glad I actually have a medical diagnosis for SFN in case I have to go on disability due to all these debilitating symptoms but it does nothing to really explain why I am experiencing what I am, the hormonal component and if I will get better after menopause. My GP has mentioned fibromyalgia since that is what they ultimately diagnose if you don't test positive for anything. Which ultimately like the SFN diagnosis is just a diagnosis of a group of symptoms not an actual disease. I honestly see people with MS diagnosis that have better quality of life than I do! 😦 Has anyone here came across any of this with Doctors? SFN, POTS is affiliated with dysautonimia which little is known about and no cure, only symptom management."

A dermoid on my ovary that could be growing (maybe around 5ish cm or more), a fibroid that got huge during perimenopause (12.9 but may have shrunk recently), weird as my derm calls them ""wisdom warts"" (not really warts, sebaccous something that they can't seem to get rid of even with burning), the usual weight gain, and now my hair is shedding like cotton candy, and again my doctors were like this only happens to some women (special women like me, no one else in my family), go get a haircut. And yes I've been eating uber healthy, paleo, most of my life, doing yoga etc. meditation. So because I'm so special as to have BOTH a dermoid and giant fibroid wondering if any of you ladies found a surgeon to remove both safely and tell you ""oh you're too old for children, it's easier for us to just take it all out"".

sakura26,2019-09-14T20:24+00:00,"Dermoid, fibroid, hair loss ... am I just unlucky?",Hi I'm terrified and my doctor is a jerk. I saw a PA just to refill an anxiety med and she made me feel like it was my fault I was anxious. Yet she dropped a bomb on me and read an ultrasound result my OBGYN had never called me back about (despite my calls to her office). She said my fibroid had grown to 12.9cm and that my dermoid that had been stable at around 5cm was now 7cm tho she did admit she might have read it wrong because the ultrasound was 5 by 4 by 7. But she was like oh that all has to come out and they'll prob take your ovary and that my OBGYN noted I should have gotten surgery a year ago when she first suggested. However I didn't because at the time other doctors said the dermoid wasn't a risk and that I was prob close to menopause and the fibroid would shrink. Also my OBYGN wanted open surgery and I'm alone with no other income and cannot take 6 to 8 weeks off work or live off disability. But today the PA made it sound like I could be in peri for way longer so I needed surgery asap but that I was crazy to be anxious like it was my fault. And she said there was nothing to do about the hair loss and that it doesn't happen to everyone. My sister and mother didn't have it so what? I also broke a crown and need an implant which is 4K I need. Am I just unlucky with everything? Why do I bother going on then? I also just found out the company I work for is running out of money. I have bad PTSD that has gotten worse in peri and after this news and no supportive doctor I just feel 10 times worse.
maddysmom2015,2019-09-11T01:24+00:00,Necessary uterine biopsy--or anxiety driving doctor shopping?,"I have 2 GYNs because I never can trust anyone in the medical profession, and as many of you ladies know, medical providers can be less than helpful during peri. . I have been having some irregular bleeding for the past 5 weeks. I had 3 periods in August, one that started on the first, the second on the 14th and the third on the 30th. I had a small spot of blood yesterday. Up until now my period was still pretty regular at about 30 days. So I called my first GYN. She had lost interest in me in July after I told her the prozac wasn't helping the peri brain fog. But she gave me my pelvic exam this May and everything was fine. Her nurse said not to worry and, that at nearly 53, irregular bleeding was to be expected. Only that if the bleeding was ever very heavy to call back. Well, my health anxiety wouldn't let go. I have a friend who had stage 2 uterine cancer and all I could think of was her. So I called GYN 2. I haven't been in to see him in about a year and half. And his nurse said to come in for a pelvic exam and likely uterine biopsy as well. I go on Friday the 13th. 😉 I've had this procedure before, so I know what to expect in practice. But that isn't calming me down. My question is--do you ever feel like health anxiety drives you to seek over-treatment? Or seek a practitioner that feeds the anxious googling you've done? Today, as I hyperventilated and planned my funeral I thought ""maybe I should have believed Dr. #1's nurse instead of seeking out an opinion that validated my anxiety."" What do you think?"

Rainbow976,2019-09-09T21:23+00:00,bioTE bhrt experience perimenopause,"Hello All, I am only 42 but have been having a difficult time for years. Been to several doctors over the years for my ""mysterious "" symptoms that no one seems to think are linked but me. Long story short, I had a consultation today with a Dr. that does bioTE pellet bhrt therapy. It's a pellet inserted into a buttock that slowly releases hormones based on lab results. It lasts 3-4 months and can be tweaked to find the right mix. Do any premenopausal women have experience with this and can provide insight? On one hand, I feel I am very sensitive to the menstrual cycle hormones now and think maybe a steady base of hormones might help. However, I am afraid of making everything worse. 1 year ago I was over 10 lbs lighter and hardly able to eat with digestion issues. Now I am in a bloated stage despite working out and eating well. I am only 5' 1"" so 10 lbs is a lot on my frame. Aside from the symptoms that change month to month, low libido has been a problem for years and neck/joint issues. Unfortunately, I am getting more dark facial hair now and shedding a lot of hair on my head. I think testosterone might make this worse and no Dr. has looked at estrogen levels because of age and because I am still menstruating. It's such a catch 22, this 1 thing will fix this but make these other things worse. I just feel I am way too young to be asexual, frumpy and losing my hair lol. Any feedback on bioTE is appreciated!"

THough I've had shortness of breath and the feeling like I'm about to keel over and die from a heart attack. Breathless walking up stairs and this is considering that I'm healthy, at a decent weight, and it just doesn't make sense. Four times in the last month I've been to accident and emergency thinking I'm having a heart attack. My symptoms are chest tightness, a feeling of a tight band around diaghram area, chest fullness, shortness of breath to the point that I panic which makes it worse... I can't deal with this anymore. Doctors do tests and everything always comes back normal. Please tell me that I'm not the only one going through this. I need help 😦"

scrangelina,2014-04-14T11:08+00:00,Perimenopause or detached from life,"I feel like that batty cat lady from the Simpsons - I feel like I LOOK mad, and I am unravelling mentally and physically. I'm 49 and have been going through the peri-menopause for a couple of years. First my periods were horribly clotty and heavy and every three weeks, now in the last six-nine months they've got further apart and lighter. But it's how I feel that's so weird. I am shaky, anxious, when I'm talking to people I'm trying to think what expression I should be wearing on my face. I feel tired but not sleepy, like as if all my energy has been sucked out of me and all I want to do is sit down. Everything seems like too much effort and I am not enjoying life when I feel like this. Some days I feel great, but there are too many days like this now. If anybody I know is going through a hard time, I've always been THE most supportive person, but lately it just makes me anxious because I feel I'm being sapped of what little strength I have left. I avoid people, especially high maintenance people. I'm trying to force myself to take a shower now. I love being clean and having freshly washed hair, but even that's too much. My roots need doing but I can't be bothered. And I don't even feel human, let alone like a woman. I feel like I'm drifting away from friends, like I have nothing to bring to the table when it comes to being good company. And I wonder if anybody has any experience of whether diet helps. I felt really good last week and I was eating well - could it be as simple as that? I've had a weekend of too many carbs and a curry this weekend. Scrange x"

I had abdominal ultrasound done and everything was fine. I also had bloodwork done last week and my t3 is low and estrogen 14, and progesterone 0.4. I get this feel of something in my neck ( thyroid area) especially if i look down pressing my chin against my chest. I get air hunger. I was told that I need to take something to support my hormones and thyroid. Ive tried progesterone cream but it gives me heart palps, and trigger hot flashes. My poop has been green for almost 7 months now but no one can tell me why. I don't know if it's any connection but I believe that it is. Ive lost weight and I cant gain any weight at all , my digestion is so messed up . I just want to feel normal again."

I can also feel my stance is different from the bloating...like its jutting my stomach more outward and arching my back more.

elaine62759,2019-09-03T10:36+00:00,Nobody to support me and at rock bottom,"Hello fellow sufferers. I started going through peri-menopause about 6 years ago and went through menopause 2 years ago when I had my last period. I thought after my periods had finished things would get better but although the hot flushes have thankfully much improved I'm still stuck with this awful fatigue, mood swings, brain fog and poor quality sleep. I also have ME/CFS which I've had for over 20 years but this fatigue is different from my normal one. Everything I do is an effort and I have no motivation to do anything or go anywhere now and have no patience with anyone anymore. I feel like I have the moods of a teenager without the energy! I've been told HRT wouldn't be suitable for me due to my medical history. My GP is totally unsupportive and just said there is nothing he can do about it and told me to look up the internet. I have also now been told I have high cholesterol which is just another thing to get me stressed. My husband isn't very supportive either and friends I have seem to have managed to get through it without any problems or HRT. I stopped smoking, cut out alcohol totally, reduced my caffeine and have tried changing my diet including more lentils, oats and pulses. I don't know what else I can try. I feel like I've run out of options and don't know where to go from here. Does anyone have any suggestions for non HRT things that might help? Does it ever get better? Sorry for the long rambling post but don't know where to get help. Thanks for taking the time to read this. Any suggestions would be really welcome. Elaine"

Rainbow976,2019-09-01T15:37+00:00,Why only some of us???,"When I feel particularly crummy, I tend to dwell on the question of ""why"". Why some of us have extreme, life altering symptoms and/or an early start of symptoms or symptoms for many years. And why we all know so many women that are completely fine and enjoying their lives. What's the common denominator for those of us suffering? Aside from hormones and chemicals used in modern food production, birth control pills are also relatively newer and used more frequently in the last 40 or so years. Personally, I have used bcp on and off for about 20 years of my adult life and wonder what this does to the body longterm. It has always been sold as the easy solution to prevent pregnancy but I now question if the medical community really knows long term consequences. I mean, if bcp stops you from releasing an egg, what happens down the road when the body is preparing for menopause? If we are born with a finite amount of eggs and we do not release them with ovulation for a number of years, could that send the body into chaos? Are those old eggs still in the body trying to get fertilized? Anyone else with extreme symptoms have a history of bcp usage? My symptoms started in mid 30s with low libido, hair shedding, sensitivity to foods and some digestive issues . When I turned 40, it all ramped up with new symptoms that come and go along with shorter cycles. I went down a path of thinking it was Candida, intestinal parasites, EBV (I had bad mono in my teens) and eventually settled on perimenopause when I found the list of 66 symptoms. But I still question if there is a systemic problem causing me to be so sensitive to hormones now. I will be 43 in December and hoping this will ease up at some point because this can't be my life forever. I only feel well a few days a month now. Sorry for the long rant, we have a 3 day holiday weekend in the US and I have zero energy to exercise, clean house, socialize, etc. like I planned to do. I hate being so disinterested in EVERYTHING."

Always above the right eye and or left temple , before hand everything that comes before the bad attack very bad blurry vision auras numb back of head.. So today I'm experiencing top right side of head quick shooting ice pick type headache starts in the top of my head on the right side and shoots down to bottom of back head very quick and super sharp! From what ive read its an ice pick type headache and can be very common with migraine sufferers.. I do have all other menopausal symptoms as well.. But this headache has me freaking out it keeps coming the sharp pains over and over again right in the same spot.. I have had these sharp pains before however never lasted this long or was this intense.. So my question is do any of you menopause ladies out there get these like this, how bad what did you do or take for them..

I can only describe the pain as a burning sensation which feels weird but sore at the same time. Also, I've been seeing floaters or spots/dots on and off every day. I've been for an eye test and I was told that it's normal for women experiencing menopausal symptoms. My doctor said that it could be a sign of under an lying illness which really freaked me out. Have any of you ladies experienced these symptoms and will it go away. I've had both these symptoms for months now.Thanks."

Have any of you experienced this, and does it mean I have to start all over with no period for a year? I think that would send me over the edge, lol. My Dr has said that some spotting is normal after several months without a period. She says it's a sign of being near the end of peri and can happen in post menopause as well. I am skeptical but will give her the benefit of the doubt. I have noticed other symptoms such as mood, off balance feeling, aches and pains have not been as bad in the last few months so maybe its truth. We shall see..."

Keljo48,2019-08-08T22:53+00:00,Skipping heart beats.,"I am 51 and just shy of two years post menopausal If it isn't one thing it is another or multiple things at once. So I have had chest and breast issues this entire year. I had right breast pain then left breast pain. Got a 3D mammogram and it is all ok, so they say. Started having fluttering heartbeats in the middle of the night that made it hard to for me to sleep because - I worry. Then I had severe upper right just above my breast pain in the beginning of July that sent me to the ER. After tests they determined it probably was Costochondritis. It went away about 2.5 weeks later. But in the I had an appt with my Dr. the next day after ER for left breast pain. She did a breast exam, hit that inflammation and I wanted to hit her. She said she felt a thickening on my upper right breast, and wanted me to see a breast surgeon. Ok I felt it was the costochondritis but I wanted to know about why my left breast keeps aching. Two nights ago my heart started what feels like skipping a beat. Was not that frequent but was like hiccups in my heartbeat. So today was my appt and my skipping got worse. (I figured stress from traffic and appt added to the skip). My appt went ok, Seems that I am fairly normal (ha, me normal?) though she didn't do an ultrasound. She did notice the skipping in the stethoscope but didnt' comment other than avoid caffeine. I read that it might be or might not be serious. That it will usually go away on it's own. Anyone else have this issue? I keep wavering on going to ER. I think I have a room there with my name on a plaque. lol."
vicki19082,2019-08-10T20:30+00:00,"Loss of appetite, acid reflux, peri menopausal, dull ache in right side, desperate!","Hi all. My name is Vicki and i'm 45 years old. A couple of months ago i experienced some acid reflux and change in my stools. The reflux passed in a couple of days but my stools remained softer, thinner and a yellowy/orange colour. I went to the Docs and a colonoscopy was arranged for me. Before the colonoscopy was scheduled I went to Spain on holiday with my family. Before the holiday I had 3 weeks of spotting before having a 2 week long period. The last period I had was in March, so the spotting and 2 week long period happened 4 months after my last period. During the holiday I started getting acid reflux again and began to loose my appetite. Not good on holiday! Since i've come back i've had the colonoscopy which seemed to be okay but my acid reflux is awful and I still have no appetite and have to force myself to eat. I have completely changed my diet to only acid reflux friendly food but I'm still suffering. I've lost nearly half a stone and i'm really worried. Could all this be linked to perimenopause? I also have a dull ache regularly around my right rib. Can anyone help? I'm struggling..."

I feel like a heat wave rushes through my body from feet to head, my forehead starts sweating and i have to take off what i can to cool down. They last about 30seconds but happen about 10 times a day on the days they occur. Since having my 2nd child 18months ago my cycle returned to normal but recently i underwent blood tests, a hysteroscopy and MRI to check my ovaries, uterus and pelvis due to extreme ovary pain and sudden heavy, longer, more frequent periods. They said my T3 hormone was a bit low but nothing to do anything about. Basically found nothing worrying. However im still worried about early menopause as cant understand why i would get such odd hot flushes and my usual clockwork cycle is suddenly unpredictable in timing and flow. any advice would help. I feel like if i go to the dr they will just say that my blood was tested a few months ago and nothing was abnormal.."

I really need the support. Menopause sucks! I've spent so much money on seeing doctors & doing all kinds of tests in the past 3 years. Well, the good news is all turned out normal except for high cholesterol. Is anyone on HRT and does it help? My gynae actually suggested HRT but I'm resistent aftering hearing all the risks.

I don't have the usual hot flash & insomnia. Am I normal? I have changed my diet - cut off caffine, chocolates & processed food, drink lots of water, eat lots of veg & fruits, pop vitamins & tried alternative medicines & therapies, but nothing seem to work.

I started having symptoms in my late 30s. fatigue, anxiety like I never had before, insomnia. I got sick at 37 the day before my period started that left me with loss of appetite, off balance, sensitive to sound. i eventually felt better but never the same. I would wake up in the morning with flu like symptoms, diarrhea, watery red eyes and burning in my arms. went on birth control and felt a little better. but then on my 40th bday weekend i got really sick with nausea and fatigue and since then I.ve been pretty much debilitated. I had morning nausea for months, lost 40 lbs, gastritis and started having tons of Neuro symptoms with tingling, burning, numbness, even stinging. the adrenal surges and depression have been horrific. My skins changed, much thinner. my face is red, have malasma. my whole body is hot all the time now. have burning, stinging on my tonge, arms, hands and now legs. the scariest part is not being able to stand for long without feeling weird, dizzy and getting more hot with brain fog. them when I do sit down i have an overall feeling of malaise and just being ill. just from mopping the floor and vacuuming I can wake up the next day feeling dreadful with the burning, stinging, weakness and feeling unwell. it's ruined my life. thank God I work from home or i don't know what I'd do. I have 3 children, one grown who lives with me b.c of all this and 2 in high school. I.ve been to every doctor possible with no real answers so I know it has to be hormones but I still can't believe it. I.m almost 3 mos on BHRT and it's helped some but not nearly enough to stop the suffering and constant discomfort. I've never been this scared or suicidal in my life.

Upped dose of amlodipine for BP which gave me dreadful anxiety, leg cramps, nausea, so have stopped them. BP is absolutely normal. One dr suggested citalopram which sent my anxiety through the roof, hated it. I have little appetite, horrendous anxiety, can't stand the heat, can't sleep, regularly wake at 5.00 am with morning anxiety.

My periods cycles started getting shorter right when I turned 45. They went from 28-30 to 20-25, and heavy and clotty lasting 4 days. My most recent period started at 29 days and has been really light, and sometimes watery/mucousy I had a few clots, but they were smaller and thinner (if that even makes sense) then usual. I usually have to wear three pads at a time, this time I could go a while day and night on one (obviously I changed it frequently). I am now on day 8 and it is more like spotting now. Is this normal? I am really freaking out because it is so light and still going on. I have also had some Pelvic achiness and discomfort on my right side which I do get every period into ovulation. Has anyone had anything similar? It is also a bit burning down there, but that could be from the pads and maybe wiping so much? At this point I have no clue! 😂"

I thought that this project would be a good distraction from the physical and mental symptoms of perimenopause, but I am finding it incredibly hard to cope. Even though I have so much good in my life, my brain is locking into fear and any perceived negative. I just keep pushing myself to continue because I don't know what else to do, but I am physically and mentally drained. It is just so hard for me to conceive that hormones can so fundamentally alter my personality. I used to be so confident, bubbly, optimistic, and full of energy. I have been doing this for two years now, and I continue to forge ahead because I want to live my life, and I know that I have a lot to look forward to. My cycles have changed a lot in the last two years: they were shorter, but now they are lengthening.

Ladies, here is a link to a scientific study we can refer to remind ourselves that we are not going crazy. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042810014643 It's a study from 2010, with results indicating that women in the menopausal transition really do experience pain more intensely. Things that would not generate a pain response in a reproductive-age woman do generate a pain response in women with low estrogen. Same is true of anxiety... events that would not generate higher anxiety in a younger woman do generate anxiety in women transitioning to menopause. THIS STUDY IS 10 YEARS OLD. And cites data from studies that are even older. Why the &$^%^ is there not one decent approach to helping women through this by now?!?!? Ending my rant, but not my boiling rage.

tebrown96,2019-08-02T13:42+00:00,Does anyone suffer from LPR (Silent Reflux)?,"Oh, my goodness. I don't know if this is another lovely perimenopause symptom (I feel like I've had them all!) but it could easily be the worst. I've been dealing with it off-and-on since I started peri (about 18 months ago; I just turned 45) and usually a round of Nexium takes care of it. This bout is worse than any I've had. I haven't slept much this week, as the cough/scratchy throat/phlegm/gagging wakes me every hour or so. I'm doing Nexium in the morning and Zantac right before bed and neither is helping. I've just started taking Tums after eating, too. I hate popping all these pills. Also, is there a correlation between LPR and your cycles? I still get a period for a few months, then I'll skip one, then have one for a few months before skipping another. I am due to get my period on Monday (if it comes on time) and my last bout of LPR was a week or so before my period in June. I haven't been very good about adjusting my diet, as all the things they say to avoid are my favorites (tomatoes, onions, spicy food, chocolate, alcohol). I know I need to be more proactive in that area, and I could probably stand to lose 10 pounds. Guess I'm just looking for someone else to say they deal with this, too!"

sue38546,2019-08-05T18:33+00:00,Upper back pain HRT?,I have been taking HRT patches - continuous combi - for 4 weeks now - two weeks ago I woke up with the most horrendous pain across my upper back - no position could give me relief from the pain - it felt like everything inside was being squashed & tight - once up and moving about the pain eased - just a niggly ache as if my bra’s a bit tight. Since then I have woken up after a few hours sleep in absolute agony in the same place and the only way to stop this is to get up - some nights I’m pacing the floor at 2/3 am. Other symptoms is a feeling of bloating towards the end of the day. I’m getting distraught (docs today) as my father died from pancreatic cancer so as you can imagine I’m convinced that’s what it is. I’ve been reading on here about other ladies with back pain & wondered if anyone was suffering the same on the patches or any HRT so that I can put my mind at rest???

GoingCrazy,2019-08-03T20:05+00:00,Menopause,"Hi, I've been going through the menopause since my partner died in Dec 2015. His sudden death put me into an early menopause aged 44. I'm now 48, and whilst the symptoms have eased a little, I've had to take a month off work due to the lack of sleep and hot flushes. My doctor will not prescribe me HRT as she says I'm too young, but the anxiety, lack of sleep and generally feeling a little crazy is driving me to distraction. I've had counselling, exercise regularly, eat healthily etc., etc., but having no medical help is making me feel very emotional. She's referred me to the local menopause clinic. With being off work, I'm feeling more relaxed, as I find my stressful lifestyle made the symptoms much worse. I sleep 1 night in 3 properly, so am constantly tired during the day. I've become an insomniac after sleeping well most of my life. My partner's death obviously hasn't helped, and I'm struggling as to what is grief, and what is menopause. The worse symptoms for me are lack of sleep and the panic feeling in the night, urgh, I feel like something awful will happen. I've had other symptoms too; dizziness when I'm walking, cold chills, and horrendous brain fog; I'm working full time and doing a degree so it's really hampering me. Does anyone have any good advice? I've not taken any natural supplements as they are so expensive and I don't believe them to work, if I'm honest. But I am now reaching breaking point, especially with the anxiety, to the point I'm thinking of totally re-thinking my future career path/life."

Last night I woke up shaking uncontrollably and feeling so cold that it was like someone threw me outside in the dead of night during a Wisconsin blizzard in January.

I woke up several times in the night alternating between freezing and burning up. This morning I just feel lethargic and warm.

Apart from that I just sailed through the menopause without any problems at all, as my periods just became more and more erratic until they just tailed off, finishing with the one from hell!   I had a smear 5 weeks ago (for which I still haven't got the results) and happened to mention that in the intervening 2 years and 3 months since that last period I've had 3 episodes of spotting.  The period was in Oct 14, then in May 15 I had a week of spotting, as if a period was starting but it didn't.  In April 16 I had one day of light brown spotting, then in Sept 16 I had literally a few pale pink spots which lasted a couple of hours, and that was it!  I wasn't at all concerned but the GP sent me for an ultrasound which was today.  They couldn't find the endometrium very well, so gave me a transvaginal ultrasound (for anybody else reading this, it's absolutely nothing to worry about, way better than a smear and I was so relaxed I could have fallen asleep [cheesygrin] ).  The endometrium was found to be thickened...apparently the guidlines say that anything over 3mm should be investigated, and mine is 6.  Now I am to be referred to a gynacologist..obviously I'm concerned but is it possible that it's actually nothing at all?  Has anyone else been in this situation?  Thank you, Louise x"

I had a hectic schedule cosequetive 6 classes in my school. Later I found some water like discharge. I thought it is normal .It increased with time. Next morning i found some bleed. I went to a radiologist for USG . It showed Internal OS Open . Cervical Length less-than 2cms . Irregular heartbeat of fetus. I went to the doctor, after examining physically.He said nothing could be done and needs to be aborted. Labour was induced by injection later D&C My question is this can Physical Stress(Standing for a longer duration,riding bike etc) cause Preterm Labour before 20 weeks ? I was having vaginal discharge a thick white discharge before this incident .Was it a warning for a Infection ? If my cervical length after breaking water is less than 2 cm will it effect my future pregnancy ? What are my chances to have a full term delivery after this incident ? Without Cervical Certilage ?"

I'm waking up EVERY MORNING way before the alarm - too early to start charging around the house (not that I have the energy to). I have blinds, blackout curtains and another blackout blind, so the room is as dark as a cow's insides. But I still wake up. As soon as I stir, the cat thinks it's time to get up, so he sings the song of his people outside the bedroom door - even if it's 5am, he really couldn't give a toss. So my 'Might get back to sleep, if I'm lucky' turns into me rolling about like a burrito until I finally get back to sleep, 5 minutes before the alarm kicks off. I've no idea what the chuff is waking me up every day, but it's sure as hell pi$$ing me off now!"

Then they show this happy smiling woman in her own bakery, with a big smile on her face happily serving customers. No wonder our husbands, families, friends, and most of all doctors don't take us seriously. The media acts like it's no big deal. But it is. 20 percent of women leave their jobs because symtoms are so severe, 85 percent have symptoms. Only about 15 percent have no symptoms. I'm so over society acting like we're just a bunch of hypochondriacs."

First off i tried a few birth control pills but they caused me horrendous side effects, but after having 2 kids by the age of 20 i thought i had to do something. So 2 weeks after my second son was born i felt great! I go into the dr to get the depo shot. She gives me the shot throws a pamphlet at me and im out the door. Fast fwd a 3 days and the next thing i knew my world was turned upside down! Severe anxiety and panic attacks hit, i lost 20 pounds and i bled no stop for one year. After so many months of this i finally read the pamphlet, had i known i never would have gotten it! Ever since getting the depo i never felt normal again and i started getting very sick on my periods when i never did that before? Now that i am going through menopause i have this sickness so horribly! My mom and sister never had this much trouble...but they never got the depo shot. Thoughts??"

I'm 49, been on depo provera contraceptive injection until recently and now on a mini pill. I haven't had a period in years due to the depo, but had some spotting last week. So no idea if the menopause has kicked in yet. I get some hot flushes and am irritable as hell! In the last few weeks i have had a lot of aching around my ribs, just where my bra sits on the left, round into my back too. I have also had pain in my left shoulder blade and armpit. A few days ago i suddenly got a trapped nerve pain in my right shoulder blade. I've read a lot of similar age women are getting this too. My boobs seem to take it in turns to hurt too. I'm having trouble laying on my left side to sleep, very uncomfortable, the right side is a little better. However I lie my boobs feel uncomfortable ( they are big 38F) and feel extra heavy lately. Yesterday I came down with a cold and feel even more achy, muscles in back and neck, sore throat, throat glands, headache. My armpits are both now feeling quite puffy, probably due to the cold. I recently had bloods done after a few very bad panic attacks and was all clear, also had ECG. Anyone else feel the same?"

nanc00951,2019-07-23T17:27+00:00,Coming out the other side??,"Hello I have been on this forum too many times to count complaining and questioning the many symptoms of peri menopause I have had. So happy this forum was here because many were so helpful, and I knew I wasnt alone. One of the worst was the anxiety and the feeling of always wanting to cry. There were many days I went through the day in a fog just wanting the day to be over. I had a very, very hard time. Doctor either suggested I start hrt or antidepressants. I started neither. I did fill the antidepressant prescription because I was getting very desperate to feel better, but I never took it. I am 56, my last spotting was the beginning of February, so I am still not officially in menopause. Since I haven't visited the forum lately, I thought it was only appropriate I write. I do not want to jinx myself, but as of late, maybe a month, the anxiety seems to have lifted . (this was by far my worst symptom) It made me not want to leave the house, and if I had to go out I just got through what I had to do and couldn't get home fast enough. The crying is somewhat still around. I wake up with the feeling of wanting to cry, nothing to look forward to. But I also attribute this to having other personal problems. Anyway, if this helps, some of my horrible symptoms have passed.....FOR NOW anyway. This was a question I have asked others, was there a light at the end of the tunnel? And I think, if I didn't have other personal stuff going on, that I could say I am in a much better place. (perimenopause related)"

My spouse is having his this week so I have been reading up on it.. I really don't want to do this and probably won't schedule for a long while.. I can't imagine all the prep would make me nervous. He is looking forward to it because he THINKS he will lose weight and be thin again-- I don't think this is the case. Do people go to their regular routine the day after the test.. Thank-you

So last night my sinuses decided to close completely up on me, which is scary when you can't breath. After a trip to the Dr and a steroid shot, that was taken care of. But my new symptom that I have heard several of you Ladies talk about is cold feet! I mean seriously?! I remember thinking I was so glad I didn't have that..well....that thought should not have entered my mind because for the last couple of weeks I have had cold feet!Now add that to the leg, knee, hip aches and the soreness of my feet and I'm pretty sure it will never end! It is 100 degrees outside and I am wearing winter socks! Again I discuss this with my Dr and according to her? Yeah, it's all normal when our hormones are working to balance out after peri. I myself am a little bit skeptical at this point. So from what I understand, our aches and pains get worse right before our hormones even out. I'm not sure how much of this I believe but I am willing to give her the benefit of the doubt! Hope all of you have more good days ahead!🙂"
Lisa_in_Tx,2019-01-14T02:27+00:00,Daily headaches or migraines,"Hello All, I'm new to this forum and discovered it trying to research why I'm having DAILY headaches and/or migraines. It started on November 1, 2018 with a severe migraine that had me in tears for about 5 days and since then I will either have a severe headache, a migraine or at the very least a dull throb. Time spans without any pain at all are very rare and don't last very long. Notes: *I turned 47 in October *Advil/Alieve/Excedrin usually do not help at all *RX of a Triptan for migraines did not help at all *Acetaminophen + Codeine will take the edge off, but not completely (also, do not want to use too often due to all the news coverage of addiction issues) *CT scan for tumor or brain bleeds came back normal *Due to bloodwork results Dr prescribed a thyroid medication. Most recent bloodwork came back with normal thyroid results, am to continue the medication for the time being My question is... if you have experienced headaches and migraines as a symptom of menopause, did you find a remedy to reduce or minimize this symptom? I am so frustrated and am starting to feel like a shell of the person I was. I haven't been to pilates once since this started and have missed multiple of my daughter's orchestra and theater performances, missed book club and volunteer events. Also, I feel like my house is turning into an unorganized mess as I find just doing the bare minimum overwhelming and taxing. Please help! Lisa"

Lesley998,2019-01-07T16:13+00:00,"EARLY MORNING DREADS, DEPRESSION AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS","Hello I posted here years ago about joint pain. I was at the very early stage of experiencing the life changes that happen as we enter peri meno and menopause. I thought I was dying. All new to me. Palpitations, sudden waking at night, unable to move in the mornings due to sore joints, extreme anxiety, breathing problems (asthma) rapid heartbeat..I had all known symptoms. To cut a very long menopausal story short…my copeable symptoms morphed into a living hell of other issues, including suicidal depression.I hope to help others by this discussion. Please please use this thread as a way to channel your own depressive and suicidal feelings into words, in the hope we can all help each other and lower the numbers of misunderstood, ‘mad’ women. In 2014, my beloved elder sister committed suicide. She had a history of depression, culminating in her taking her own life at age 56, after entering and experiencing the hormonal cyclone known simply as ‘menopause’. I personally have struggled with suicidal thoughts since the onset of meno. I believe it is less of a genetic connection, and all to do with a chemical imbalance - all set off by lowered levels of oestrogen and subsequent lack of serotonin. I have struggled to make my feelings known to my GP and the NHS in general. I believe women have - and still do - struggle with this since time began…being burned as witches, committed to asylums, misunderstood etc. I have been on Prozac for 15 years, without which I firmly believe I would have taken my own life. For me, it all began after the onset of peri when I was around 49. I have a number of posts on here under my name Lesley998 if you wish to read up. In 2015 I awoke one morning literally wishing I was dead. It almost came out of nowhere. I had been feeling low, but until this date I had never felt suicidal. I remember waking up and immediately realising I wished I hadn’t. I stared the wall and willed myself to being asleep or at least unconscious again. I have a good, easy life. Wonderful husband. No money worries. Grown kids. But, I could not face the day ahead. I remember feeling that I just wanted to sleep, to die, to be unaware of life. I now know this was nothing to do with my life, or feelings or the environment I found myself in. This was organic - psychologic - not imagined. I had a severe lack of important hormones and brain chemicals that were making me feel like this and it was all to do with MENOPAUSE. The four most important brain chemicals are serotonin, endorphins, oxytocin and dopamine. Normal levels cause feelings of safety, calmness, happiness and self confidence. Deficiency can cause feelings of self obsession, low self esteem, obsessive thoughts, paranoia, fear and suicidal thoughts. I am not a health specialist or doctor, so I cannot really comment more. But I KNOW without a doubt that my suicidal feelings and early morning depression (well known in meno forums as the ‘morning dreads’) were caused by lack of brain chemicals and hormones. Lack of serotonin and too much adrenaline and cortisol. I would awake with a feeling of dread and depression..and writhing legs and feet…I literally could not keep my feet still in the bed. A known effect of adrenals producing too much cortisol. I am lucky. I persuaded my GP to put me on an antidepressant (old style Prozac) without which I would not be here writing this. I can’t say I am back to normal, but I no longer wish to kill myself. Please. Share your stories here. Let us all help each other Lesley 998"

christine66659,2019-07-09T08:08+00:00,Educating the young,morning all..think its about time menopause became part of education at school.we are taught about the changes to our bodies during puberty sex and pregnancy but not about the menopause..lots of people are mis informed about the menopause to..saying on average symptoms last this long or that long..we truly have been dealing with hormones all our lifes...true menopause is when the periods have stopped for a year and you go into post and your body lives without hormones..i have spoke to so many ladies who have found this part of the journey to be the worst and expect symptoms to actually stop when for a majority they do not..we all habe our own ways of dealing and coping but do feel forwarned is forearmed..educate now ♥️

I have leg spasms and general aches which I can cope with but I also have sharp pains in my upper abdomen under my ribs. the pain goes around my right ribs and over upper back but my upper abdomen is the worse. I've tried antacids which made it worse and I've taken paracetamol which has no effect. I get really panicky and am frightened by it. has anybody experienced anything similar?
sakura26,2019-07-07T02:03+00:00,HELPPP!! Peri Making PTSD and Dissociation Unbearable and Unsafe.,"Hi, I tried to post this on the Anxiety board weeks ago and no one responded. Maybe I'm the only one dealing with it. I've had complex PTSD and dissociation since I was nine. I've tried everything over the years (I'm 47) meds, EMDR, hypnosis, psychics, breathing, meditation ... you name it and nothing has cured it. I even went to a neurologist and ruled out seizures or tumor. Though I've oddly had a few years where it's dissappeared, once when I was in a long-term live-in relationship and once when I had an eating disorder that I think numbed me. Since I hit peri my anxiety and PTSD have gotten hellishly bad to the point where I now sometimes have dissociative amnesia. The other day I had a bad wave of what I call the ""sick feeling"" a mix of terror, shame and nausea I get before I dissociate and I don't remember what happened but a few minutes later I had intense leg pain and looked and saw my leg and arm were covered in large purple bruises. My dog was there but obv did nothing lol. Anyway I can't live like this, wondering if anyone else has the same thing and found a cure. I don't have one single worst memory of a trauma that caused the PTSD, but I have multiple memories of a horrible, terrifying childhood and a rage-aholic father that still could care less about me. That's why I live far away but alone. On the opposite coast. I really think if I was married it wouldn't be as bad. But who wants a fat, perimenopausal PTSD crazy person. Unless I win the lottery lol."

amanda35780,2019-07-07T00:50+00:00,"Not sure if Perimenopause- High Anxiety, Panic, Feeling Crazy","I'm 44. My aunt-in-law passed away end of May, and I was caring for her until she went to hospice, and have been running between her and my parents-in-law's house taking care of their needs. I bring this up because about 8 months ago I started to have anxiety almost all day and bouts of panic attacks. I only had anxiety like this once before on Levothyroxine, I went off it and have not taken anything since October. Gradually I have started to feel like I am losing my mind. Fearing fear, feeling drops in my stomach, foggy-headed, forgetful. Irritable beyond normal feelings- red hot irritation. Dark thoughts. I scare myself. I am normally laid back and compassionate. The anxiety has become somewhat more manageable, but the thoughts are not what I want in my head and scare me. PMS is insane, I become worse emotionally than I used to be. Last month I spotted before my period and then it was normal. This period was a week early exactly with cramping over a week before starting for 3-4 days. I asked the doc in October about Peri and she said I was too young. My therapist thinks its Perimenopause, and possibly sleep apnea. Unfortunately I can't get anyone to look at me until end of August. Any thoughts?"

A few days ago, my period started and no migraine. It was super light, which was also surprising since they have been very heavy for the past few years. I had two days of thinking maybe this peri nightmare was ending. I was giddy at having a reprieve from the bleeding and pain that comes every 21 days. Then, I woke up on day 3 with one of the worst migraines I have ever had in my life. I laid in bed in agony all day. I had ice packs on my head and vomited into plastic bags while still in bed. It was close to 15 hours of suffering. I was in so much pain I couldn't even cry. I have dizzy for weeks. My anxiety is extreme. How much can a person endure? For how long? Near my breaking point."
swansong,2019-07-04T18:34+00:00,Treatment for atrophic vaginitis to do or not to do?,"Hi to everyone. I'm new to this site, and I would like to hear sound opinions on what my question please. I was with my doctor last week and after examination I was told that I have atrophic vaginitis. I am not symptomatic except for a tiny bit of spotting now and then. I was prescribed Estradiol (a medicine called Vagifem). I was quite happy to use this until I read the insert, it mentions that there is a slight increased risk of ovarian cancer. I saw my young sister suffer and die of ovarian cancer and I am obviously worried that I might be putting myself at more risk if using this product. I am very reluctant to use these tablets. I am not concerned about my vagina being atrophied, I went to the doctor to get myself checked in case I needed to go for further exams. So my question is: to use this Estradiol or not to use it? Has anyone any experience with this product? Is there a doctor that can help me out here? Many thanks."

Keljo48,2019-07-01T19:48+00:00,"Multiple symptoms. Sometimes we need to vent, right?","Hi, My name is Kelly and I am 51. I have been a member of Menopause conservatively 6 years. I have graduated from peri to post about 2 years ago. Somehow I didn't get my pin for graduating. lol. I have posted on this site before and I have tried to help posters also because this menopause (post and peri) is a scary, stressful and at times lonely affliction. Definition of affliction: something that causes pain and suffering. I have pain and I am suffering. Some days are better than others. I never know what the day will bring. This week as been absolute hell. To start, I had a skin infection on my upper groin pubic area on left side. Think ingrown hair/boil like. It sat just under the skin and caused me a lot of grief off and on for more than a month. I had it lanced last Sunday and packed with gauze. It isn't that big but AHHH. Not enough numbing. I felt it all- minus the scalpel (thankfully.) It is clearing up nicely. Doc put me on a sulpha antibiotic 2x a day for 10 days. I have taken it right on time. I also take BP meds and a statin. Not really a fan of the antibiotics or post-menopause. I live in FL and can't go out in the sun for any length of time while on med. So I have to direct my hubby on yard work. My neighbors see me out and they go inside. Sigh. I don't want to be a she devil really. I am hurting and scared and worrying and miserable. It makes me snap at my husband (married over 26 years). He can help it he is a guy and has no clue. 😃 I just don't have the patience anymore. Anyway, I have nausea and left breast soreness, now I feel like I pulled some weird muscle in my chest wall on my right side. I have a stiff neck I also have a weird pain/pull feeling really low on my right side groin area. My back is killing me, I have a wee bit of a fever. 99.4 I feel like someone ran over me with a hormone truck. That horrible doubting little voice says. ""What if it isn't hormones? What if it is cancer/tumor/ incurable things? What if I am the freak and no one else feels this way? What if you never feel better"" I really hate that voice especially when I don't feel even remotely human. I am living my pain and suffering. My neck, my back, my side, my chest, and my groin area. I can barely function. I have a Dr appt tomorrow for left breast pain. So much more is attacking me now. She is going to think I am a mess .I want to feel better. I want my mom because she always made me feel better, but she lives several states from me and has dementia now. 😦 My husband doesn't know what to do with me. Ugh. I don't know what to do with me either. I step down from my venting soapbox. Thank you. Wishing you all normal hormones and beautiful days and night. XX"

Although no doctor can tell me definitively that peri is what is going on. I have an appointment to get my hormones checked to see if there is anything telling there. I go through periods (no pun intended!) where I feel somewhat okay. However, the last three weeks have been awful. I ended up in urgent care after one of these ""episodes"" I get frequently. My heart starts racing out of the blue, I get very lightheaded, have a weird pressure in my head, throat and chest, my BP drops, and I pretty much feel like death is coming any minute. These strike me suddenly, although often in the morning it seems. I sometimes take Xanax during these episodes which can help but not totally. By the time it's over I am left feeling shaky and exhausted. I've seen a cardiologist, wore a holter monitor, had an echo and a stress test. They put me on metoprolol (beta blocker) for the occasional high heart rate and kind of sent me on my way. I've had my thyroid checked and adrenal function. All normal. One other thing to note: my periods are super erratic and can be crazy heavy when they come. I am sooooo tired of feeling like crap. I can't enjoy my family, friends or normal activities like I used to. While I am eager to get my hormones checked, I am also a little nervous that it is going to show they are within normal range and not what is causing all this other nonsense.

I go back to looking for my phone and find it beside the cat food (did I feed her?) Anyway, time to enjoy my tea...where the heck is my tea?? Can't find it so I make another. Then as i sit down to read more responses i realize I need to go again!!! I go into the bathroom and there's my first cup of tea!

Noticed some nipple puckering today when I raise my arms, but I,also, had a breast reduction many years ago where they reconstructed the nipples...so could be scar tissue. Had a mammo with US in March for the same problems (for the most part). Nothing found and they said nothing about cysts. Although, I do have dense breast tissue, so I know that may not be noticeable. I have a breast US scheduled today. Can someone shed light on this for me? Has this been your experience? Posted a couple days ago in a different thread and only got a couple responses.

Like so many of you probably feel I am afraid to tell my doctor anymore of my symptoms because I feel like I am just not being heard. As so many of you have described I just feel like an ""old lady"" at the age of 48. My symptoms started a few years ago but who can remember exactly when as it all eventually becomes a big blur. I have put on 50 pounds in the past few years and am almost always tired. Do I want to do something about this? YES! but I'm so tired. Been through similar things as the rest of you, mood swings, elevated pms symptoms, bloodwork that came back showing elevated inflammation and white blood cell count but ""don't worry about it"" because test for RA came back negative. When it all first started getting really bad I could barely get out of my car and god forbid i try to lift my leg to get over a curb. Most recently I had surgery last year on both hands for carpal tunnel syndrome which is much better but i still have pain in my thumbs, wrists and wedding and pinky fingers. Went for nerve conduction tests and they were fine but the numbness and pain is getting worse all the time. They say I have De Quervain syndrome which is obviously true but neverless the specialist still had a way of making me feel like I am a hypochondriac. I have received a call from GP to follow up on the results and don't even want to go...feels like it's easier to just suffer in silence. For instance after being told i had alot of inflammation in one if my knees (which I went for a cortisone shot) the doctor told me that it's not like it's cancer and nobody ever died from arthritis. Sigh!! Sorry to go on and on but I am actually so happy where my life is right now with my wonderful family and only working part-time 3 days a week but somehow still feel miserable...."

I had it on left side about two weeks ago. I googled symptoms and all kinds of diseases came up. I just thought I'd ask if anyone else has this and how long does yours last . I read that this normally happens in legs and back when muscles are overworked but I havent done anything physically lately, google also said that calcium and magnesium defficiency can cause this. I would appreciate any info . GOD bless everyone!"

charcey97,2019-06-21T21:39+00:00,"Breast issues in Peri? Sore, tender, full, lumpy breast tissue...","Hi ladies. A few months back I had an issue where my breasts were feeling swollen, heavy, full, seemed irritated and itchy, and had a weird leaking sensation throughout the day (with nothing there). I sought out a diagnostic mammogram at that time, which was fine. Currently, I am having soreness, tenderness, and lumpiness in my breasts. The soreness/lumpiness/tenderness seems to be more so on my left, especially in the breast area next to the axilla and slightly up into the axilla. I don’t feel anything rock hard or irregularly shaped ( just palpable), but then again I always second-guess what it is I’m supposed to be feeling. The lumps are tender to the touch and it feels like the muscle area is, also, tender. I'm 44 and had a partial hysterectomy (still have ovaries) two years ago, so trying to link it up hormonally without cycles is near impossible. I had my diagnostic mammogram with US 3 months ago and as mentioned, was normal. Of course, I have dense breast tissue, so thats always a concern about accuracy. As a check in with these new issues, I had my doctor order an ultrasound of my left axilla along with a complete ultrasound of my left breast. They ordered another mammogram (despite not feeling anything upon exam in the office), but I preferred to stave off the radiation until I can see if it’s needed. I'm thinking I may be in perimenopause, Anyone experience this with perimenopause?"

liz49535,2019-06-20T13:30+00:00,bleeding during sex possibly due to fibroid,"Hi. I have been bleeding during sex-not every time but it has happened quite regularly. I think certain positions I am more likely to bleed but there is no set formula. This has resulted in my partner being hospitalised with a kidney infection and became quite serious. This was due to his getting some blood inside him whilst having sex. Everytime we have used condoms they have broken and takes away the sensation for both of us too. Since then I have had all kinds of investigations such as ultrasound, some kind of ?scope, where they put a camera up inside my womb. They said I have a slightly bulky uterus and a small fibroid but that the fibroid is not big enough to consider removal and didn't think it would be causing the problem. In short they have done all the tests they can and told me it is unexplained which basically leaves me and my partner unable to have sex. This is particularly hard as we live quite far away from each other at the moment. The hospital said I could try taking some blood thinners but i really don't know how that would help and I really don't like taking potentially unhelpful medications. I was wondering if anyone knew whether they thought that that the motion from intercourse could cause the fibroid to bleed and really if they had any ideas what else I can do to get this sorted out? I only have bleeding during sex and it doesn't look like period blood more bright red but I don't feel any pain or anything. Thank you."

Then I feel so weak and fatigue ..zero energy. A fatigue that is indescribable but cant relax because my body seem wired but fatigue . Why was I feeling so good and now all over again I'm just miserable.

Extreme fatigue, feeling off-kilter, feeling like my muscles aren't listening to my brain's signals, digestive system is a mess. I am feeling so incredibly down, and people who aren't going through this just don't understand how debilitating and defeating the symptoms can be.

She's 48, and just today told me she's been having bleeding and almost period like symptoms like sore breasts and stomach pain. I gave her some of my feminax but it only eased the pain and didn't take it away completely. This only started today, and we're making an appointment at the GP today at 9am. The only other thing I heard her mention was that she was peeing more often, but yeah. She's been in menopause for the last 10 years. She had a really early menopause, like the other women in her side of the family. She also had a brain hemorrhage two years ago (was on HRT before that, but doctor stopped it) and she slightly spotted the day after that in hospital. No one was really concerned about it, and it went away promptly. I guess I read a lot, and I've now worked myself into a frenzy of panic, so I thought I'd come here for some support or advice. It'd be much appreciated."

I can't see, my anxiety is through the roof, I have racing thoughts of doom and gloom, etc.. And, this dizziness that started after an episode of room spinning vertigo...is too much to handle. I tried the Epley Manuveur and it did not improve my symptoms. Maybe it is due to my constant squinting and jaw clenching? My life is stuck on pause. I feel utterly useless and helpless. I need to find a job (after being fired), but I don't even know what I could do. I wish I knew it would get better, so I could work toward a goal. sigh"

I just want to cry and cant take this feeling so ill for much longer . I have had every symptom going for coming up to four years now and I will be 52 in August . I dont know how much more I can put up with . This weird dizziness I get at times worries me . It seems to travel up through my body like Im going to pass out and my head gets all swimmy , if that makes sense . Oh and the sweating at night !

I have found one med that has helped but still not back to myself. My problem is I have moved out of state but have managed to keep my doc in Ohio (I live in Nevada now) but have to switch as I need to have this issue addressed. I have SEVERE health anxiety and I just made an appointment for the new doc for tomorrow. I loved my old doc as he was aware of my anxiety and never made an issue of it. I'm already a nervous wreck and could use some positive thoughts to get me through this appt. Always fearing the worst. My heart rate always skyrockets at the beginning of the appt even with my Xanax. Why is this so hard for me? I'm trying to calm myself to no avail. Any suggestions or good juju appreciated. You ladies are a blessing for sure.

Anyway, the coil came out fine but doc saw a small polyp and suggested a hysteroscopy would be a good idea just to check everything. its scheduled for next week and although the consultant was very reassuring im just terrified and crying my eyes out imagining allsorts. im scared of the general aneastheic but also the fear of something awful being found is making me feel sick. im just crying and panicking. im really trying not to panic but if any ladies have been through this and have positive words of support id be really grateful. thankyou so much xxxx"

sakura26,2019-06-08T04:00+00:00,"Maca, Chasteberry for Large Fibroids?","Hi, I saw a very old discussion about this but I'm still super confused. Maca and Chasteberry are supposed to balance hormones but some say they can actually increase hormone levels and cause issues if you have fibroids etc. I'm in perimenopause and have very low progesterone and my fibroid has had a crazy growth spurt the last 2 years from 8 to nearly 12cm. However, even though my progesterone is low, when an arrogant, overpriced, idiot naturopath gave me natural compounded progesterone, telling me it would shrink the fibroid and solve everything, it actually made the fibroid grow another cm in just a few weeks and made me gain a ton of weight in my middle and breasts that I still can't lose nearly a year later. So it seems like there is no simple way to balance hormones. Even my OBGYN said that, women's hormones aren't simple math, esp pre-menopause. I'm debating surgery after trying tons of other things as it's still growing and doctors say it's possible I won't hit real menopause for several years. Also I've heard large fibroids often don't shrink enough during menopause, esp if you use HRT. So to shrink the fibroid I've tried -- vegan diet (DIET DOES NOT CAUSE THIS, I have always eaten paleo and grain free for decades, so sick of diet-shaming people claiming diet cures all, assuming you weren't already eating healthy and that there aren't plenty of people who eat garbage and have no health or gyn issues), acupuncture/herbs, castor oil packs tho not super regularly, green tea pills (800mg daily for over a year). The only thing that helped a bit was ulipristal (shrunk it a couple cm) but then the fibroid grew back in a month and I had terrible side effects while on the pill due to my already low progesterone and age. Don't want embolization as have seen recent studies that say beads can actually move inside you, and don't stay put as promised. And Acessa seems like an overpriced scam that doesn't work for larger fibroids due to real patient reports. No great options for women, really. So wondering if anyone has tried either Maca or Chasteberry for a large fibroid, NOT tiny ones. Or found any other non-surgical help. My doctor is pushing for open surgery and I really want non-invasive as I'm alone and can't take all that time off work. Plus surgery just sounds bad for you and there's always the risk of losing organs when female organs are NOT valued in older women. It's like oh you can't have babies, you're not using this, let me just toss it in the trash for you. Thanks!"

Here are my new issues and praying I am not alone with these as hate running to the doctor (who is pretty much worthless) anyway. I do have tonsil stones so at first I was thinking those nasty little buggers (who as of the last year have been getting worse so I am digging them out weekly). Ladies, any of you with............. *Pain on right side of throat. I do not have issues with swallowing in fact that makes it feel better. It feels like stickers back there. *Ear pain (deep) on that same side that comes and goes. It's hard to explain but it's short and intense then goes away when it feels like. It's almost like a nerve or something. *Hurts in front of that ear sometimes too and also jaw aches from time to time. Of course I am thinking I have CANCER but I am not hoarse, I do not have issues with swallowing, I am not losing weight, I am not nauseated, I am not having any other symptoms other than being stuffed up (slightly) and sneezing off and on in the mornings. I have NEVER had issues with allergies so just trying to figure this all out as Dr. Google is driving me insane (lol). Anybody?"

Some days are better than others, but for the last couple of years, I have had issues being able to find the proper words in a conversation. especially when I am nervous or when I am doing something out of the ordinary like a presentation. I find myself stuttering as I’m trying to search for the word which is usually a very simple word that I should be able to find. There is some days it happens several times a day and some weeks it only happens a couple times a week. at times, I will even put a similar word in that does not make sense in the conversation at all. Four instance, I might say ""put the milk in the cupboard"" instead of ""put the milk in the refrigerator"". It’s very unnerving, and makes me feel like I’m getting early dementia or something.

If i didn't have grandchildren I'm sorry to say but i wouldn't be here. I know that's a defeatist attitude, but right now i don't care. Is there anyone else out there suffering with this incredibly full on symptom?"
Guest,2019-05-31T23:40+00:00,Anyone else have mouth changes?,"i have weird question for everyone, do any of you all of the sudden notice you lose your sense of taste for salt or sweet and your mouth feels like there is a slippery coating with your tongue feeling kind of fluffy? Similar to when the numbness starts to wear off after a dental procedure. I have been dealing with the strange taste issue for 2 years and now i havent had a period since the beginning of February. But the strange tongue and mouth thing is beyond strange! During this time im generally nauseous and lightheaded and it will last for a couple of days then it wears off and i start feeling like i can eat again. Its driving me crazy! I noticed a strange mouth early in my pregnancies but nothing like this!"

My husband gets up and goes to play golf, then comes home and does yard work etc. His energy is endless. Me? I sit in the house...worrying, googling, watching tv trying to distract my mind. I don't want to go out and shop. I try to think of what I enjoy doing...Gym? no, but i do it anyways. My youngest is 16 and driving now. Everything has been about the kids. It kept me busy. i am supposed to be getting my gallbladder out soon (this has been a few years coming) but of course I am going to obsessively and excessively worry about it and everything else. Does anyone else do this? Hot flashes are coming multiple times at night now. Is that making the psychological part worse?"

My official diagnosis is tenonditis calcification on my right shoulder. Has any lady sth similar? the doctor said that there is inflammation on my shoulder because my cells are trying to eat and absorb the calcification.

She prescribed Vagifem, Yes VM, low dose Amitriptyline which were prescribed by my GP and have really helped. She also prescribed 4% Aqueous lidocaine to be used prior to sexual intercourse to ease the pain but my GP was unsure how to prescribe this so sent a query to the surgery pharmacist who two weeks later prescribed Vagisil 2% medicated cream which I dont think is the correct thing. Has anyone used 4% Aqueous lidocaine to ease the pain of sexual intercourse and if so how was it prescribed? and how to you use it. Thanks for your help and advice."

So i was diagnosed with ibs 2 years ago and that was the start of my journey. Fast forward 2 years for the most part I have been symptom free I had to change my diet remove dairy certain foods are a no go. Well i hadnt had a period in almost 2 months then i finally had one. It went on wo a hitch i bled for about 9 days with another 2 days of spotting. About i would say 4 days after i started to feel unwell. Dizziness aching and sore muscles stiff neck. I don't need to tell you ladies you no the deal. Then my stomach started to act up it been a few days now and it is my ovulation week with yesterday being my highest pregnancy day lol..no babies here. Now to my question. I have had a gurgling stomach with a tremendous amounts of gas . Slight discomfort and extreme bloating in upper part of belly. pressure in between shoulder blades that comes and goes. And also Im having what i think is palps every once in awhile while but it feels more like a quick hard thud then done. But I've been extremely bloated so not sure if its pressure related. Just looking to hear others stories and suggestions. Sorry for the long rant just want to feel better.

WELL 16 years down the line I am ten times worse with the anxiety and depression and I have a lovely nine stones of weight on my original body ( before some smart arse says that my hands weren't tied behind my back and I was force fed I know I eat cause that's my coping mechanism.

I write this tonight cause I have a heavy heart as I am applying for a job that I am really good at and have applied three times for it and they don't reply. This will start off an episode of depression and because I've recently had post menopausal problems so the two of them will give me a doozy of a down time.

susane84679,2019-05-28T14:49+00:00,WE HAVE TO TAKE CONTROL!,"Hello Ladies, I hope you all are having a good day so far.I want to start off by saying that I am in no way diminishing our symptoms or how we are feeling on any given day. This Hell we are all going thru is rough to be sure and we all struggle with many of the same symptoms. We can not let This control our lives, we cant let it dictate where and when we go somewhere. I know that several of you ladies are moms to younger children and you have mentioned how you have pretty much given up on being the mom they deserve because of how you are feeling from one day to the next. DO NOT DO THAT!! We have got to take control of our lives and not give in ( although that is the easiest thing to do) it is not easy but we are women, we are strong and we will persevere ! We have got to accept that menopause is what we are going thru, not who we are. It is a phase of our life and will not last forever. I think the most common complaint is Anxiety. I suffered with this for years before meno, until I decided it would not control me any longer. I was afraid to leave my house because of it. So, I got off the meds and started doing things I enjoyed before, it did not happen overnight but it did happen. I had to train myself to think differently and when anxiety reared its ugly head I kept moving forward and refused to let it stop me. I have not had an attack in years even going thru meno! We have to take control of our symptoms and our lives Ladies, we can not let this hell win! I know how scary and difficult this journey is because I am going thru it myself, with many of the symptoms you ladies suffer from but I have a normal life because I refuse to let it control me. I absolutely have bad days but for the most part they are good. I am not saying anything negative about how someone else is dealing because we are all different, I am just sharing my story because I want all of you to know that you can live a normal life while going thru peri/meno, but that it's up to each individual to decide when they've had enough of missing life and how they will get it back. Hope all of you have the best day ever and sending hugs to all!"

Now my lining is about 2x what they say is okay as far as cancer risk. I've been living a menopause hell. Don't see why not to just have the hysterectomy and be done?

I do not mean only chemicals in food and modern life style but I was wondering if the plethora of satellites around us along with the ability of military and space organizations even to remove and affect the conditions to other planets for their geopolitical schemes have affected the function of our bodies and may accelerate ""idiopathic"" autoimmune health problems relate to our hormones and metabolism . Not mention the vast amount of radiation that we are exposed to!!!! As you know the moon has a direct influence especially to women behavior and menstrual cycle.

Mayfly1,2019-05-20T05:59+00:00,Lloyds phamacy has supplier issues,"I tried to get my usual HRT (Ellest Duet) two weeks ago, only to find that Lloyds has ""supplier issues"" so I can't have it. They haven't told anyone, so I ran out and then spent over a week re-applying to my doctor for another prescription which was supposed to be based on any HRT that Lloyds DID have, and then spent another 3 days waiting for that to come in. So, first point : I ould advise making sure you have an adequate supply before asking for more. Secondly : do the side effects of Novofem go away? I've only taken 3 tablets and so far I have flatulence and I am still getting hot flushes. I think I may have bloating as well, but as I had to stop taking my HRT in the middle of a ""period"", my body is now completely confused. I just want to go back to my lovely Ellest which gave me no issues whatsoever and apparently even caused me to lose weight whilst I was taking it, but I guess that's not going to happen...."

becky21031,2019-05-14T03:53+00:00,Anxiety before period,"Im 42 and obgyn thinks Im going through peri. The thing that bothers me most is the anxiety. At 40 I suffered my first panic attack outta no where. I went to ER. Then many times after. They put me on sertraline. A year later I went off it. Now Ive pinned down the anxiety to the day or 2 my period begins. Anyone else have this issue? I feel like a crazy hormonal lunatic. Oh and ever since I had that first panic attack at 40 I cant go into big stores or crowds. Its too much stimulation and I get anxious. 2 years ago an ENT said it was vestibular neuritis which goes away in a month. But now looking back Im thinking this has also been my crazy hormones. These have been my symptoms since age 40: Brain fog, anxiety, heavy periods, fatigue, forgetfulness, longer cycles, sore breasts more frequently, intense cramps, stomach issues. So ya I accept Im changing. It sucks. The anxiety bothers me most. It can be crippling. Anyone else experiencing this? How do u even deal with it? Thanks."

My period just ended few days ago. It's like peri is playing mind games with me. So sick of this crap, I can't plan anything since I never know how I will feel based on my symptoms. I feel frustrated, it's robbing me from my family time and life just in general. I am always agitated, I am losing my friends since I keep away from social life because I have no energy or motivation.

Stacy4412,2019-05-17T17:36+00:00,"Constant Dizziness/Lightheadedness - Soar, Stiff, Twitching Leg Muscles w/Tingling Sensation","Hi Ladies, I'm new to this forum. I'm so glad to find you all! Hoping some of you can relate to my story so I don't feel like I'm dying. I'm 50 yrs old and post-menopausal for 2 years now. I don't ever recall having peri-menopausal symptoms, but to some extent, I'm sure I did. However, once my period stopped I started having ""normal"" menopausal symptoms in the beginning such as hot flashes, low energy and irritability. I took the Estroven supplement and felt great for about 6 months. Then I stopped the supplement and continued to feel fine for about 6 months until one day everything changed. I woke up one day in August of 2018 and my legs felt like I had done 1000 squats!! They were sore/stiff, weak/shaky and twitching everywhere. The left side of my body had a tingling/cooling sensation from my ankles to my face. I also became extremely dizzy/lightheaded. I thought I had either MS or ALS! I started researching my symptoms and of course that made me have terrible anxiety! When I tried to sleep I felt the anxiety well up inside my body and felt a fluttering in my heart. I saw my GP and had every blood test imaginable. He found nothing, everything was perfect! However, I told him I was scared that I had MS or a brain tumor so he referred me to a Neurologist. I had an MRI and every other test imaginable...nothing, I was fine! I then thought it could be my heart or low blood flow since I was always dizzy, so I went to a Cardiologist. They did every test imaginable...nothing, I was fine! I then went to an Alternative doctor who said I probably had an auto-immune disease so they ran every blood test on me including a stool (poop) sample....except for finding out that I once had EBV (epstein barr virus - that was a shocker!)....nothing, I was fine! I then went to an ENT doctor because the dizziness was chronic and debilitating. I always felt like I was going to fall over everyday, all day! I had pressure in my head and ears and also developed Tinnitus. The doctor said I probably had Meniere's Disease and that there was really nothing I could do for it. He prescribed Valium, allergy meds and water pills but they didn't work. I took the Valium once and then got scared of becoming addicted so I discontinued it. I then remembered that my mom was super dizzy when she was going through Menopause. So I went to my Gyno and told her my symptoms but she said that dizziness wasn't a normal symptom. But because my hormone levels were so low she put me on HRT, the lowest dose. Everything started to feel better except the chronic dizziness/lightheadedness so I searched for other solutions and found an Upper Cervical Chiropractor that said my Altas (1st vertebrae) was off and that there is a connection between the Vestibular System and the Nervous System. So they corrected my alignment. It's still a work in progress but it seems to have helped a little bit with my dizziness, though, I still have Tinnitus. Also, I stopped taking HRT a few months ago because I didn't think it was helping with the dizziness BUT boy, that was a mistake because all my other symptoms have returned. My twitching, sore & achy legs are back, irritability during the day and the anxiety and hot flashes at night...UGH!! So I decided to go back on HRT a few days ago hoping for the best. Can anyone relate to my symptoms? Even though I NOW believe all of my symptoms are related to menopause, I still fear that there is something seriously wrong with me such as MS or ALS. 😦 Sorry for the lengthy story, it's my first time telling it publicly. Thank you for reading!"

becky21031,2019-05-16T02:12+00:00,When will our doctors listen,"Just an observation here. After going through mri, blood tests, cat scans, ekg, vestibular rehab therapy, and numerous numerous run of the mill tests why has it taken me over 2 years to figure it out on my own? Hormones. One simple words yet many complex symptoms. The doctors and Im talking GP, NP, physical therapists, neurologists, ents...all of them from the emergency room to the doctors office need to get educated more. Talk of perimenopause and menopause used to be taboo. Now you have so many of us suffering anxiety, depression, body changes weve never experienced and most doctors say oh its stress. Take ativan. Or depression meds. Until I came here I never realized how many of us suffer the same symptoms. Heck it was here I read others cant even go in big stores like Walmart without panicking anymore. Thats me too. Never had this in my entire life and one starts to feel crazy. I know theres no easy fix but I wish doctors would get a clue given were women and a certain age as it might be peri or menopause starting. None of them EXCEPT my obgyn mentioned it. I feel the more we make it known and let it out in the open then we can better manage our symptoms instead of playing guessing games. Im going to bring it up to every doctor I see from here out."

The past few days I have alternated between feeling annoyed with everything, anxious or so sad I was crying and not really understanding why I was crying. And just a few minutes ago - I started to feel that familiar ache in my breasts. I am not going to be a happy camper if I have another period. I just want this DONE!"

An FSH/LH blood test showed that I am peri/menopausal. I'm 49 and still have (unpredictable) periods. My GP prescribed Clinorette tablets but the local pharmacies say there are supply issues. The GP changed my prescription to Elleste Duet but, again, there are none available. So then he prescribed Kliovance.... and I'm sitting here looking at the patient info leaflet. It says they are for women who haven't had a period for 12 months. I have. I'm wondering whether to take them, as I'm desperate to deal with how low my mood has been, but as the 3rd choice of meds should I wait until the 1st choice, Clinorette, is available again?"

Then followed all the crazy symptoms of peri. I am only 44. I am working with a naturopathic dr which is costing me a arm and a leg but feel so much more comfortable with her than my dr who knows nothing about the peri and menopausal women . All she wants to do is push antidepresents which i refuse. I feel like this peri came in my life like a thief in the night and robbed me from my life and womanhood. For you ladies who have lived with this longer than me how do you cope ? How do you accept this ? How long has this plagued your life. I feel so down tonight."

I enjoyed a few short months of feeling good, but now they are back. I get this weird feeling, followed by some vision issues. Next, my palms and feet sweat. Then, I start to feel this odd warm/burning sensation (no sweating). All this with a surge of anxiety. Sometimes it feels hard to breathe through it and/or swallow. Occassionally, my voice sounds weird to me as well. I think the throat and voice are both due to the blood rushing to those areas. Why can't I just have the hot and sweaty type of flash?! Why must I have this weird anxiety, panic, odd type of flash. I hope it doesn't last forever. To make things worse, I got fired on Friday.

If I exercise a bit it relieves the feeling but it comes back and getting up from sitting or out of bed is hard work! I'm 47 but feel 97. I'm on HRT and recently started a new regime, up until this month I felt the oestrogen side of HRT helped my aches... I stated using utrogestan pessaries and the achiness came on around that time... I've now stopped using the utro for this month but the achey feeling is still there in my legs! I've googled it (I know, I know - never google!!) and I'm now terrified i have PAD and circulatory disorders as I do have varicose veins which ache now and again but never this bad.

I don't know what the consultant did but I am feeling so sore inside and out. I found it uncomfortable to sit down for the first couple of days afterwards and I feel bruised inside and out. I have been bleeding, although that is slowing down now. I am wondering whether he used an instrument that was too big for me and forced his way in. That is what it feels like. I usually have the smallest speculum when I have a smear test as I find it so painful. After a couple of days I decided to have a look with a mirror to see what state I was in. I have a huge gaping hole at the entrance to my vagina when it is normally closed. My question is - will the hole close up or am I damaged for good? I am definitely not happy with how the procedure has gone, especially as I have had one before with a GA and had no problems at all."

Guest,2019-05-06T22:35+00:00,63 and post menopausal since 2003,"I am 63 yo and have been post menopausal since 2003. I recently started having vaginal pain, so I went to my GYN to find out what was going on. She said that I had sever atopic vaginitis and started me on an estrogen pill and Premarin cream. Well the cream made the burning and itching worse, then I had break though bleeding (just a little heavier than spotting). I let her know about the spotting and she changed the medications to Prempro. After using this for 14 days I started bleeding, a full blown cycle, its been 6 days of a heavy period. Now I don't know what to do. Are there any safe alternatives to HRT? HELP!!!"

I often get this where because I'm anxious it is assumed I don't understand like everyone else and the opposite happens with some doctors they tell you nothing and I always end up having to phone and ask them they also assume we can't take in information so they don't tell us.

Guest,2019-05-02T13:53+00:00,Not sure there is answers,"I had a hysterectomy (quarter of 1 ovary left) back in 1995, and since late teens have suffered from hypothyroidism. In retrospect I should of noticed that I wasn’t feeling the cold as much, getting hot when doing any work and waking hot in the night. In 2014 my lovely husband passed away out of the blue and for 2 years I was in complete denial. In January 2016 I began feeling really low and depressed and thought that maybe I needed some help, but before I could BOOM! I started with what I thought was a tummy bug and it all went down hill from there. Within the next 6 months I went to A&E 6 times and was MISdiagnosed with anything from crohns to overmedication of thyroxine. It was then I went to see an endocrinologist privately to sort out my thyroid, best thing I did he actually listened! Well I wasn’t overmedicated at all but he did tell me that with my age hormonal shifts can affect thyroid, it was then the penny dropped I did a bit of research, of course what an idiot I had been MENOPAUSE!! I also decided to seek help from a therapist and discovered I was also suffering from complicated grief, anxiety & PTSD, who I still see to this day. I am certainly much better now and each year gets slightly better. My symptoms of which I can remember : No appetite – I couldn’t eat or drink much for around 6 months all I managed was ice chips and an odd bowl of rice I nibbled on crackers. I lost nearly 2 stone in this time. Bowel and stomach pain which was crippling. 24/7 Nausea just awful. Heat Intolerance- couldn’t stand heat generally, no hot showers only cold and couldn’t bear a hair dryer. Insomnia – 1 to 2 hours sleep at best. Difficulty swallowing – like my throat had something in it. Dry mouth. Tachycardia Diarrhoea for months on end. Weight gain -well the 2 stone I lost turned into 3 stone gained which won’t budge now. Tiredness & Exhaustion. Anxiety, Anxiety,Anxiety Oh brother! Where to begin. I turned into gibbering wreck and became agoraphobic. Chest tightness Pounding heart Restlessness Emotional/Depressive Brain fog & lack of concentration Loss of confidence even afraid to drive ( been driving over 30 years) Constant headaches Tremors and shakes both internally and externally Brain zaps. Hot Flushes & Night Sweats – these were continual one after the other 24/7 I have probably forgotten loads. I am guessing by now I am probably post menopausal. All I can say is as time passes symptoms get a bit easier, and others disappear if only we knew which ones and when. ◦"

Well she told me there was a polyp on the lining of the womb and took a scraping which were described as a biopsy got a letter yesterday normal cells. Now I went up to hospital on Wednesday I thought to get it removed and was told that the polyp would need to be removed by General anaesthetic but she went ahead and got her young male gynaecologist to probe where it was and get a biopsy. I will now get to my point why didn't they leave it and get it checked when they were going to remove it was this just practise for the younger doctor. This waiting for test after test has got my anxiety off the charts. Sorry for whining but it's better than lifting up an item and throwing it through my window to relieve my anxiety and much cheaper. xxx

No period for 4 months then bleeding heavily for 30 days, not spotting, but bleeding. Both legs feel like flu aching, like when period began as a teen. Endometriosis history. Did not have a cycle for 4 months. Bled rectally, kind of a lot of blood and dr did exam and said had a hemorrhoid at entry of rectum. Said could be diverticulitis. Gave antibiotic. A few days after on antibiotic, began bleeding vaginally, after no period for 4 mths. Ultrasound over a few days showed wall thickened from 11 to 14 in one week in from 2nd week to 3rd week of bleeding.. Appeared no more bowel blood after vaginal bleeding began. Saline ultrasound showed no polyps or fibroids. Biopsy completed 5 days ago. Colonoscopy scheduled in 4 days. Dr recommended hysterectomy and preferred having colonoscopy done before in case endometriosis encroached. Nurse said colonoscopy is needed bc heavy bleeding 30 days is not normal. I've read on here some people do have it for a long time after not having a period. Period history, heavy and painful periods. Always on time and no breakthrough until last couple of years and dr said it was normal to expect spotting in cycle approaching Menopause . One year ago, I was bleeding some during pap and it came back abnormal and biopsy then showed clear. HPV was done and it was negative also. Could antibiotic have triggered hormones or something to trigger shedding of uterine lining? Anyone have endometriosis during peri with heavy long bleeding? Anyone have leg pain during Peri or Peri and Endometriosis? Please anyone having peri issues like me?"

I started post menopausal bleeding six or seven weeks ago was sent for smear that came back normal then I was sent for vaginal ultrasound which said there was a polyp and they took a biopsy of the lining of the womb that came back normal cells. They then told me I couldn't get the polyp removed under local anaesthetic so the doctor got her junior doctor to take a biopsy which was horrendous as the young man couldn't get a large cut of the polyp ( oh God did he try to the point he was hurting me) so that biopsy couldn't get cells off it to small a sample. I shall now get to my main point I have been told I can't get the polyp removed by General anaesthetic as my b.m.I. is to high in otherwards I am too fat and they can't take it out by local anaesthetic so what I want to know does anyone have any ideas ( the lovely Kerry whom I speak to on the forum suggested spinal block) what else I can get . Your help with this query would be much obliged........ Heather P.S. Can you live with polyp in there or is it best it's removed if only to stop the bleeding.

For a bit I thought maybe i was pregnant but many test have said other wise. I have completly missed my Aprils period and from what Ive been told its common to miss a period. I should be due for a period in what i believe would be the first week in May. The last 2 days I've been hungrier than usual with some sweet and salty cravings which is my norm. I havent yest experienced hot flashes and i believe I had one today. Felt like a wave that came over me i felt dizzy and a little nauseated extremly hot and my heart rate sky rocketed. Thank god my husband was home. I splashed my face with cold water and put a cold rag on my neck. It lasted a few min. I also felt very shakey . Does this sound like a typical hot flash? Ive never had it so im unsure. And if so what do you ladies do to help it in the moment. Ughh so scary and has sent my anxiety into over drive.. Help...lol

Then, my eyes got a bit wonky. Next, my palms began to sweat. Soon, I felt warm in my chest, back, and upper arms. Suddenly, I felt faint. My heart was beating fast and pounding. My legs became heavy. Am I passing out? Having a heart attack? I began to panic, but was in a situation where I couldn't flee. It subsided in about 10 minutes, but I am still reeling with aftereffects. Was it a hot flash? I feel like I am losing my mind. I was getting better and felt good for a few months. Now, I feel like I am headed down the roller coaster. I am so tired of being anxious and scared. I just want to cry. Why do all the other middle-aged women around me seem fine?"
Serradipity,2019-04-30T19:44+00:00,"OMG, so happy that I found this community!","Hi I'm Serra, And for the past 2 1/2 months I've been so anxious about possible being pregnant, but unsure if it's actually perimenopause. I'm 47 years old so it's most likely perimenopause. Plus I was told things like frequent urination and constipation along with nausea and food sensitivity and increased sex drive only happened in pregnancy. But after reading a lot of posts, I see that those things happen too. Also, I have an IUD, so pregnancy is really low to begin with. However, the reason I've been so worried about it; my 5yr Minerva was supposed to come out in Dec 20018, but I was traveling and got a nasty flu-bug passed around the family for 3 weeks. Then in Jan our oldest crashed the family car (everyone was okay-but I got really stressed out and started having breathing problems.) I had to go to the ER and was told I was having a panic attack, but the ER Doc said, ""...you know, your IUD doesn't work after it's expired..."" I replied, ""...my appointment is at the end of May."" Now, since I've had the IUD, I haven't had a ""bloody period"" and on the very rare occasion (especially fun sex with the hubby) some spotting. But everything else: Moodiness, crampy for the week, and overall PMSy. Normal. Then February came and I wasn't feeling so well; headaches, sensitive boobies, and a weird tummy feelings. Thought about what the ER doc said and took a test, came out negative. Started getting tired and grumpy as well as annoyed with certain foods. Then March came and things got interesting, talked to my mom and she told me how it was for her (Menopause) and thought, I must be going through it, I'm about the same age she started. The weight gain and the sudden freezing one moment, the being so freakin hot! Got a nice little belly going with my muffin top, still tired and moody and feeling sick all the time. But what got me was the sudden bizarre dreams, and waking in the middle of the night and not being able to go back to sleep. And what really started to get me worried was the increase of ""having to go to the bathroom"" and then for an entire week of Belly pain. My uterus felt like it was I don't know, cramping inward in different directions, while it was being pushed up into my abdomen, causing my abdomen to feel like it had a rubber band around it. Which comes and goes or I just got used to it. Besides the Belly pain felt very similar to the one time I've had an UTI...so again I thought that was the culprit. However, no pain when I urinated. But still a little worried (my first pregnancy never registered on the HPT, until an ultrasound was done at 4 months.) Took another HPT and it came out Negative. During that time I would say I'm between 6-9 weeks when I took the test. And now I have light headiness and everything else mentioned. I've been a mix of emotions; I've tried getting an earlier appointment, but no go. Now I don't know what I feel, my body is a kaleidoscope of symptoms. One day I see Menopause, the other I see Pregnancy. Am I reading too much into this, is this just the mind trying to tell me I'm pregnant but in reality I'm just starting the stages of Menopause? Counting down the days until I see the OB-GYN is driving me bonkers! Have any of you felt like this? Thank you in advance for your voice and thoughts, Serra"

hopeforever,2019-04-03T20:40+00:00,My hormonal test came back OK. So how can that be if i am showing signs of perimenopause,"I just received a call from my doctor informing me that my hormonal blood work came back ok. But how can that be if i am showing signs that i am in preimenopause. My symptoms are anxiety, panic attacks, internal shaking, head pressure, ringing in the ears, weak legs and arms, heart palps, heart racing, back pain lower and upper, dizziness, rib pain, breathing, throat problems which feels like something in throat, a few hot flashes, sound sensitivity and light. sweaty feet,brain fog etc. I do not feel like my old self, she is gone. I am crying right now because i just want answers. I have been confined to my bed for the past 2 days with such fatigue and crazy symptoms. I saw a elderly couple walking past my home looking happy and i started crying. I am 44 and feel worst than a 80 year old. I am afraid to go out alone, afraid to get an attack . My life feels robbed and i do not know what to do. Dr's look at me crazy. I am so tired of running to the ER only for them to take blood work, ekg and results showing nothing. Thank God. Why don't they have answers? why are us women suffering ? This is a time in my life when i thought i would be the most happiest. My children are all grown. I had so much planned. And now this. I just cry because that is all i can do. Have any of you got back hormone test that came back ok ?"

Today is the fifth day and yesterday and today was a struggle. Anxiety, stomach issues, headache and so much more.. I'm hoping this is hormones and nothing else is going on.."
